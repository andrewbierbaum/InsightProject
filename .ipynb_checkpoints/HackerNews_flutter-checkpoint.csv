8,"Glider pilot here. I have decent knowledge of aerodynamics, but have never studied large jets in detail. This is my personal theory - essentially what lies behind the words of a few articles I have read over the last few days, but the authors haven't been able to formulate it clearly.<p>Assuming that the autopilot and fly-by-wire systems were somehow compromized, a full stall in the ""Coffin Corner"" (Q-corner) would be a very, very serious condition. A stall causes the nose to drop and speed to accumulate. Since the difference between the stalling speed and the never-exceed speed is so small at the altitude in question, this accumulation of speed could easily cause the plane to exceed its critical Mach number, causing supersonic shockwaves around certain parts of the airfoil. In planes not designed for supersonic flight, these shockwaves will eventually cripple the effect of the control surfaces. If the plane is in a nose-down position when it looses effect on its elevator rudder, the plane will overspeed and eventually suffer structural failure (essentially meaning the loss of some critical part) due to flutter (resonance in parts of the airframe) or aerodynamic stresses.<p>A stall during normal flight conditions doesn't have to be a serious problem, but these weren't normal flight conditions. And the information that we have suggests that certain Airbus models have had problems with their pitot (speed measurement) systems in icing conditions, leading to erroneous speed readouts. The fly-by-wire system, which prevents the pilot from flying the aircraft into stall or overspeed, cannot function correctly without a correct speed measurement. And as I have detailed, a proper stall might be enough to doom the airplane.",2009-06-09 13:23:33
9,"PERFECT FAILURE<p>COMMENCEMENT ADDRESS TO GRADUATING CLASS OF
THE BUCKLEY SCHOOL<p>June 10, 2009<p>When I was asked to give the commencement address to a
graduating class of 9th graders, I jumped at the chance. You see, I
have four teenagers of my own and I feel like this is the point in
my life when I am supposed to tell them something profound. So
thank you Buckley community for giving me this opportunity. I
tried this speech out on them last night and am happy to report that
none of them fell asleep until I was three quarters done.<p>When composing this message I searched my memory for my
same experience back in 1969 when I was sitting right where you
are. I realized that I could hardly remember one single speaker
from my junior high or high school days. Now that could be my
age. Im old enough now that some days I cant remember how old
I am. But it could also have been a sign of the times. Remember, I
was part of the student rebellion, and we did not listen to anything
that someone over 30 said because they were just too clueless. Or
so we thought.<p>Anyway, as I sat there considering this speech further, I
suddenly had a flashback of the one speaker who I actually did
remember from youthful days. He was a Shakespearean actor who
came to our school to extol the virtues of Shakespeare. He started
out by telling us that Shakespeare was not about poetry or romance
or love, but instead, was all about battle, and fighting and death
and war. Then he pulled out a huge sword which he began waving
over the top of his head as he described various bloody conflicts
that were all part and parcel of Shakespeares plays. Now being a
15-year old testosterone laden student at an all boys school, I
thought this was pretty cool. I remember thinking, Yea, this guy
gets it. Forget about the deep meaning and messages in the words,
lets talk about whos getting the blade.<p>As you can see, I have a similar sword which I am going to
stop waving over my head now, because A) I think you are
permanently scarred, and B) the headmaster looks like he is about
to tackle me and C) some of you, I can tell, are way too excited
about this sword, and youre scaring me a little.<p>Im here with you young men today because your parents
wanted me to speak to you about servicethat is, serving others
and giving back to the broader community for the blessings that
you have received in your life. But that is a speech for a later time
in your life. Dont get me wrong, serving others is really, really
important. It truly is the secret to happiness in life. I swear to God.
Money wont do it. Fame wont do it. Nor will sex, drugs,
homeruns or high achievement. But now I am getting preachy.<p>Today, I want to talk to you about the dirtiest word that any
of you 9th graders know. Its a word that is so terrible that your
parents wont talk about it; your teachers wont talk about it; and
you certainly dont ever want to dwell on it. But this is a
preparatory school, and you need to be prepared to deal with this
phenomenon because you will experience it. That is a guarantee.
Every single one of you will experience it not once but multiple
times, and every adult in this room has had to deal with this in its
many forms and manifestations. Its the F word.<p>FAILURE. Failure that is so mortifying and so devastating
that it makes you try to become invisible. It makes you want to
hide your face, your soul, your being from everyone else because
of the shame. Trust me, boysif you havent already tasted that,
you will. I am sure most of you here already have. AND IT IS
HARD. I know this firsthand, but I also know that failure was a
key element to my lifes journey.<p>My first real failure was in 1966 in the 6th grade. I played on
our basketball team, and I was the smallest and youngest kid on the
team. It was the last game of the season and I was the only player
on the squad that had not scored a point all season. So in the
second half the coach directed all the kids to throw me the ball
when I went in, and for me to shoot so that I would score. The
problem was that Coach Clark said it loud enough that every
person in the stands could hear it as well as every member of the
opposing team. Going into the fourth quarter, our team was well
ahead, Coach Clark inserted me and thus, began the worst eight
minutes of my life up until that point. Every time I got the ball, the
entire other team would rush towards me, and on top of that, that
afternoon I was the greatest brick layer the world had ever seen.
The game ended. I had missed five shots, and the other team
erupted in jubilation that I had not scored. I ran out of the gym as
fast as I could only to bump into two of the opposing teams
players who proceeded to laugh and tease and ridicule me. I cried
and hid in the bathroom. Well, that passed, and I kept trying team
sports, but I was just too small to really compete. So in the 10th
grade, I took up boxing where suddenly everyone was my size and
weight. I nearly won the Memphis Golden Gloves my senior year
in high school and did win the collegiate championship when I was
19. Standing in the middle of that ring and getting that trophy, I
still remember looking around for those two little kids who had run
me into that bathroom back in the 6th grade, because I was going to
knock their blocks off. Thats one problem with failure. It can
stay with you for a very long time.<p>The next time the dragon of failure reared his ugly head was
in 1978. I was working in New Orleans for one of the greatest
cotton traders of all time, Eli Tullis. Now, New Orleans is an
unbelievable city. It has the Strawberry Festival, the Jazz Festival,
the Sugar Bowl, Mardi Gras, and just about every other excuse for
a party that you can ever imagine. Heck, in that town, waking up
was an excuse to party. I was still pretty fresh out of college, and
my mentality, unfortunately, was still firmly set on fraternity row.
It was a Friday morning in June, and I had been out literally all
night with a bunch of my friends. My job was to man the phone all
day during trading hours and call cotton prices quotes from New
York into Mr. Tullis office. Around noon, things got quiet on the
New York floor, and I got overly drowsy. The next thing I
remember was a ruler prying my chin off my chest, and Mr. Tullis
calling to me, Paul. Paul. My eyes fluttered opened and as I
came to my senses, he said to me, Son, you are fired. Id never
been so shocked or hurt in my life. I literally thought I was going
to die for I had just been sacked by an iconic figure in my business.<p>My shame turned into anger. I was not angry at Mr. Tullis for
he was right. I was angry at myself. But I knew I was not a
failure, and I swore that I was going to prove to myself that I could
be a success. I called a friend and secured a job on the floor of the
New York Cotton Exchange and moved to the City. Today, I will
put my work ethic up against anybodys on Wall Street. Failure
will give you a tattoo that will stay with you your whole life, and
sometimes its a really good thing. One other side note, to this day,
Ive never told my parents that I got fired. I told them I just
wanted to try something different. Shame can be a lifetime
companion for which you better prepare yourself.<p>Now, there are two types of failure you will experience in
life. The first type is what I just described and comes from things
you can control. That is the worst kind. But there is another form
of failure that will be equally devastating to you, and that is the
kind beyond your control. This happened to me in 1982. I had met
a very lovely young Harvard student from Connecticut, dated her
for two years then asked her to marry me right after she graduated
from college. We set a date; we sent out the invitations; and all
was fantastic until one month before the wedding when her father
called me. He said, Paul, my daughter sat me down this
afternoon, and she doesnt know how to tell you this, but she is
really unhappy and thinks its time for you two to take a break.
At first I thought he was joking because he was a very funny guy.
Then he said, No, she is serious about this. I thought to myself,
Oh, my God, I am being dumped at the altar. Im from
Tennessee. Getting dumped at the altar was the supreme social
embarrassment of that time. It was a big deal. When all my family
and friends found out, they were ready to re-start the Civil War on
the spot. I had to remind them that the last Civil War didnt go so
well for our side, and I didnt like our chances in a rematch. The
reality was that I was a 26-year old knucklehead, and since all my
friends were getting married, I kind of felt it was time for me to do
the same thing. And that was the worst reason in the world to get
married. I actually think she understood that and to a certain
extent spared me what would have been a very tough marriage.
Instead, Ive had an incredible marriage for twenty years to a
wonderful wife, and we have four kids that I love more than
anything on Earth. Some things happen to you that at the time will
make you feel like the world is coming to an end, but in actuality,
there is a very good reason for it. You just cant see it and dont
know it. When one door closes, another will open, but standing in
that hallway can be hell. You just have to persevere. Quite often
that dragon of failure is really chasing you off the wrong road and
on to the right one.<p>By now you are thinking, how much longer is this loser
going to keep on talking. My kids are all teenagers, and whenever
Im telling them something I think is important, they often wonder
the same thing. But the main point I want you to take away today
is that some of your greatest successes are going to be the children
of failure. This touches upon the original reason I was invited
here today. In 1986, I adopted a class of Bedford Stuyvesant 6th
graders and promised them if they graduated from high school, I
would pay for their college. For those of you who dont know,
Bed-Stuy is one of New York Citys toughest neighborhoods. Even
the rats are scared to go there at night. Statistically about 8% of
the class I adopted would graduate from high school, so my
intervention was designed to get them all into college. For the next
six years, I did everything I could for them. I spent about $5,000
annually per student taking them on ski trips, taking them to
Africa, taking them to my home in Virginia on the weekends,
having report card night, hiring a counselor to help coordinate
afternoon activities and doing my heartfelt best to get them ready
for college. Six years later, a researcher from Harvard contacted
me and asked if he could study my kids as part of an overall
assessment of what then was called the I Have a Dream
Program. I said sure. He came back to me a few months later
and shared some really disturbing statistics. 86 kids that I had
poured my heart and soul into for six years were statistically no
different than kids from a nearby school that did not have the
services our afterschool program provided. There was no
difference in graduation rates, dropout rates, academic scores,
teenage pregnancies, and the list went on. The only thing that we
managed to do was get three times as many of our kids into college
because we were offering scholarships whereas the other schools
were not. But in terms of preparing these kids for college, we
completely and totally failed. Boy, did this open my eyes. That
was the first real-time example for me of how intellectual capital
will always trump financial capital. In other words, I had the
money to help these kids, but it was useless because I didnt have
the brains to help them. I had tried to succeed with sheer force of
will and energy and financial resources. I learned that this was not
enough. What I needed were better defined goals, better metrics,
and most importantly, more efficient technologies that would
enable me to achieve those goals. What that whole experience
taught me was that starting with kids at age 12 was 12 years too
late. An afterschool program was actually putting a band-aid on a
much deeper structural issue, and that was that our public
education system was failing us. So in 2000, along with the
greatest educator I knew, a young man named Norman Atkins, we
started the Excellence Charter School in Bedford Stuyvesant for
boys. We set the explicit goal of hiring the best teachers with the
greatest set of skills to be the top performing school in the city.
Now that was an ambitious goal but last year in 2008, Excellence
ranked #1 out of 543 public schools in New York City for reading
and math proficiency for any third and fourth grade cohort, and our
school was 98% African American boys. We never would have
done that had I not failed almost 15 years earlier.<p>So here is the point: you are going to meet the dragon of
failure in your life. You may not get into the school you want or
you may get kicked out of the school you are in. You may get your
heart broken by the girl of your dreams or God forbid, get into an
accident beyond your control. But the point is that everything
happens for a reason. At the time it may not be clear. And
certainly the pain and the shame are going to be overwhelming and
devastating. But just as sure as the sun comes up, there will come
a time on the next day or the next week or the next year, when you
will grab that sword and point it at that dragon and tell him, Be
gone, dragon. Tarry with me and I will cut your head off. For I
must find the destination God and life hold in store for me!

Am I going to validate my bridge simulator by using a different bridge simulator? Sometimes we certainly do do this, and this is kind of the basis of iterative development (if each version of a program is a different program).

29,"On your first question, you have some examples, and I have some examples, and some rock solid data and even science would be great, but I have none to give you.<p>For your first question, I have some horrendous examples, head splitting, back breaking, life threatening, totally overwhelming and convincing.<p>As I was growing up, next door neighbor:  Get married, have one child, gain 100 pounds, and watch TV for the rest of her life, only a house mouse.<p>Wife of a friend of a business associate of mine:  Man had a good business as a designer of process plants and traveled a lot.  His wife fell in love with Jack Daniels, and whenever he got home she was passed out on the floor surrounded by empties, only a house mouse.<p>Mother of cousin of a girlfriend of mine:  Get married, have one child and retire to her bedroom with several large dogs, only a house mouse.<p>Mother of another girlfriend of mine:  Have one more child, an <i>accident</i>, retire to a back room with beer and cigarettes for the rest of her life, only a house mouse.<p>Mother of a girlfriend of my brother:  Have one child and spend rest of her life working in her garden and getting a suntan, happy only as a house mouse.<p>Pure form and worst example, mother and three daughters I knew:  Hate men, marriage, motherhood, and money, be fantastic actresses and manipulators, be from excellent up to world-class brilliant at academics, get married, have minimum number of babies husband would tolerate, be just terrified to the point of clinical depression and worse from stress of <i>social phobia</i> in any job that paid above minimum wage, be desperate to devote life to <i>saving the world</i> but never do much in this direction, feel <i>stronger</i> from having <i>affairs</i>, compete with husband and try to win by sabotaging his efforts, and dump husband at first financial opportunity, for each of the four of them, only a house mouse.<p>One women in the neighborhood:  Hated everything, husband, children, home, work, car, waistline, etc. except efforts at social climbing, only a house mouse.<p>Hollywood <i>gets it</i> and commonly portrays women as so emotionally wacko that they are from helpless down to self-destructive at anything but being a house mouse.  E.g., recently on TCM, the 1953 movie <i>Mogambo</i> showed at least one of the two main women characters (I didn't watch the whole thing) helpless and even destructive outside of a house.<p>For advising young men, I wouldn't tell them that all women can be just house mice or that the average woman mostly wanted to be just a house mouse.  I would say that among women there is shockingly large range on several important criteria for a happy, productive life, and that a shockingly large fraction of women are happy only as house mice.  Also I can say that there is a significant pattern of young women looking really stable and capable from 16-20 but going to helpless mice starting at about 22.  In particular, Nervous Nellie is nearly a redundancy.  For the single most important cause of that range I would repeat some words from an expert on women, ""Of COURSE women are MUCH more emotional than men.  That is the cause of all the problems [between men and women]."".<p>I would advise young men looking for a wife:  Under no circumstances take what a young women says at face value:  She is likely a magnificent actress and manipulator and may be lying or may actually not know in any serious sense what she wants, may aspire not to be a house mouse but not be able to do anything else, or may too soon change so that she is only a house mouse.<p>I would also warn young men:  Eventually you may conclude that Mother Nature and Darwin were there long before you were and that, net, what counts with them is a woman's position on the tree and for that what counts is her success having babies as a house mouse and that all other women are likely weak, sick, or dead limbs on the tree.<p>Yes, in K-12 and college, commonly in everything except technical subjects, the girls easily knock the socks off the boys and, thus, show high <i>ability</i>:  Still don't be fooled because Mother Nature has a trump card up her sleeve -- emotions which starting at about 16 and rising to overwhelming intensity block all ability except at being a house mouse.  Some women are still able to apply their abilities; many are not, and for that Mother Nature and Darwin just smile but their husbands, unless moderately wealthy, will not.<p>There is some <i>old wisdom</i> on these points, and women themselves have changed not at all since then:  One of the points was, ""A woman's place is in the home."". Another was, ""Idle hands do devil's work."" which warns men to keep their wives BUSY. A traditional marriage vow was that she would ""obey"":  So, men, considering what you know about you and her, map out, in your own mind, what you want her to do by the week, quarter, year, and the rest of her life, break the work down into small steps, suggest such steps at appropriate times, have the steps keep her BUSY, and shower her with praise and approval (<i>emotional security</i>) when she does well.  For a more modern view, there is the remark by Dr. Carol Nadelson (yes, likely NOT a house mouse) that ""Traditional marriage is about off-spring, security, and caretaking"" from the preface of:<p>Maggie Scarf, <i>Intimate Partners:  Patterns in Love and Marriage,</i> Random House, New York, ISBN 0-394-5585-X, 1987.<p>Next, there was a reason <i>I Love Lucy</i> was so funny, around the world:  Lucy is too much like too many women.<p>Curiously, there is support in the <i>chick flicks</i> in the series <i>Legally Blond</i>:  So, in the first movie, she got a new boyfriend and promptly got him fired from a promising position in a high end Boston law firm.  In the second movie, he had started his own law firm in Boston, and she went all a-flutter at her job, quit, went to DC to <i>save the world</i>, and dragged him down there and stopped his career a second time.  The woman outside a house was a one-person, walking financial disaster area.  She wasn't a <i>mouse</i> but she was safe from her own nonsense only in a house.<p>From the same actress, in <i>Sweet Home Alabama</i>, she wrecks her marriage to actually quite a good guy, runs off to NY and is financially successful only in a way that can work in a chick flick fantasy, gets a limp wristed boyfriend, goes back to Alabama for a day or so, wrecks everything, with her husband, her family, her friends, and also her planned marriage with her NY boyfriend, and finally decides to return to her husband as a house mouse.<p>My core advice to young men:  Mother Nature and Darwin want her to be a MOMMY. Being a MOMMY plus anything else is at best as good as being a MOMMY (Mother Nature and Darwin have not yet caught on that if she will have even a $20 an hour job for a few years that will help buy a house and help her be a mommy).<p>For being a MOMMY, Mother Nature and Darwin have some chemicals, STRONG chemicals:  Some of the chemicals apply to make her a mommy if she is not; e.g., she will create disasters to create dependency to lead to pregnancy and/or get terribly unhappy and have romantic dreams, as in the Kindle ads, of a man having her ""fly away"" with him.  Or she will be like the woman in <i>Titanic</i>, whose <i>big problem</i> was really just silly and an excuse, be so eager to get pregnant she would hook up with a third class passenger and ditch her marriage to a wealthy guy.  And there are chemicals to keep her happy in a house if she is a mommy (with children under 4).<p>Don't try to compete with those chemicals.  Instead, get her pregnant and keep her that way until she has about eight of her own children and, finally, has her whole life totally devoted to just her children and her home.  If you can't afford that yet, then wait, be successful in business, and try again.  Under no circumstances expect anything stable, effective, or predictable with a wife not solidly on the <i>mommy track</i>, ""It's not nice to try to fool Mother Nature."".<p>There are some traditional, partial exceptions:  Basically, have her right there beside her husband 24 x 7, say, as a farm housewife, customer service leader in a family business, office manager for a dentist, etc.<p>For your second question, and your exception of Page and Brin, a founder, on the Board, with a LOT of stock is easily able to be an exception:  Due to their position of power, they can without threat or concern hire nearly anyone.  But I would expect that in the middle and lower ranks of Google, my rule still applies or mostly so.  At at least one major technology company, the personnel policy is up into management or out by age 35; a side effect is essentially just the rule I gave.  In the officer corps of the US military, the rule is keep getting promoted or leave, and this rule makes my rule hold.<p>For a young person considering their career, they better just accept my rule as a rock solid fact and not look for or count on exceptions.",2010-09-23 03:12:38

31,"A few tips.  Not solutions, but touchpoints:<p>Assess your health.  An injury left me with a lot of nasal congestion and discomfort.  This severely limited my focus compared to prior.  Allergies, etc. can be similar.  Regarding this, I've become increasingly convinced that many psychological and psychiatric diagnoses are diagnoses of symptoms stemming from underlying physical problems.  And our (U.S., at least) fractured medical system means that the underlying causes can easily go undiagnosed especially with regard to these cognitive impacts.  (The poster child for this might be sleep apnea; at least it now finally has mainstream recognition.)<p>Environmental sensitivity.  I have an extremely difficult time tuning out surrounding activity -- particularly human activity.  Conversations, people fluttering about in my peripheral vision, etc., destroy my concentration.  Assess your workspace(s), the variations in their activity levels, and any corresponding variations in your productivity.<p>With peace and quiet, after an hour or two I could (sometimes still can) achieve what at least in the AD(H)D domain is sometimes termed ""hyperfocus"".  Once ""in the zone"", I could <i>really</i> concentrate, and I could then achieve not just more volume of work in a given amount of time, but also a depth of insight and analysis that others often just couldn't achieve.<p>If it's noisy and disruptive, though: Fergetaboutit.  Sometimes, once in the zone my focus would become so intense that surrounding disruptions would simply fade out of my awareness.  Not always, though, and it is something I could not / cannot control.<p>I should add that I do <i>not</i> have difficulty interacting with people.  Actually, most people seem to rather like working with me.  Being around them is just fine, when we actually are working together.  But when I need to do something they are not an active part of, their presence can be very distracting.<p>Medications.  Turns out, I'm rather sensitive to these (I'm just a sensitive guy, I guess; I suppose that explains my meager dating life ;-).  Many psychiatrists have no concept of this.  St John's Wort helped me some (though not necessarily for ADD symptoms; in fact, I sometimes wonder whether it makes them a tad worse for me).  Zoloft and its many siblings and cousins made me much, much worse.  More recently, I've run across some descriptions of what is called ""serotonin poisoning"" -- too much serotonin.  My symptoms on typical/standard doses of e.g. SSRI's fit this to a T; yet, despite describing these symptoms to the prescribing psychiatrist (to be clear, not just a physician), this condition was never even raised by them as a possibility.<p>Eventually, I learned of a psychologist with a psychiatrist wife, whose profile seemed rather similar to mine.  And he had found that one rather low dose of Adderall in the morning was all he needed.  I tried that -- after finally finding a psychiatrist who was willing to consider its use concurrent with St. John's Wort -- and, after finding even 5 mg too much, settled on 2.5 mg.  My difference being that I'll typically take 2 doses 6 hours apart (the effective life of many drug doses, for me).<p>I'm not saying you fit this profile.  But there are elements that may be of use in considering.  And be aware that, at least in my experience, there are a lot of ""professionals"" out there who won't have the first idea about really helping you.<p>That doesn't mean you shouldn't try.  But keep your sense of self, self-respect, and the old bullshit meter set to ""High"".<p>One final thing regarding medications.  About... 7 or 8 years ago, psychiatrists started pushing low doses of anti-psychotics for (initially, at least) off-label treatment for a broad range of other conditions, including AD(H)D.  Well, it turns out that at least one factor in that was a push by drug companies to develop new markets for these drugs.  IIRC, in particular Johnson &#38; Johnson ended up settling with one or another government agency for an amount in the many millions of dollars, for what was determined to be mis-represention and violation of regulations in this regard.<p>If someone starts trying to sell you on the idea of Risperdal or one of its many siblings and cousins, I'd consider very carefully and insist on a very detailed argument for this, before proceeding.  The lower doses are supposedly safer, but these classes of drugs are -- in my limited layman's understanding -- not something to take lightly, as it were.<p>Actually, one more thing, I guess, about medications:  For Adderall, at least, there apparently are differences between the brand drug and generics, and there are -- in my anecdotal experience -- definitely differences between the different generics.  I experienced the latter unexpectedly when my pharmacy changed suppliers in their stocking of a generic equivalent.  It was not a pleasant experience.<p>As I say, it was for me completely unexpected.  Only after having the initial experience did I google around and learn that I was not alone in it.<p>A final postscript:  Heavy, daily exercise also helped me.  Unfortunately, a bad leg injury subsequently quite severely limited this for me.  But I'd recommend it, if and as you can.",2011-01-07 04:23:33

36,"I'd like to have enough money that I can provide the sort of life my parents gave me to my kids. Even though I went to college on a near full-ride, my parents were ready to pay out of pocket for tuition if need be. Even though I worked from the time I was 15 on, my parents never required me to - school was my job. Even though I probably could have gotten into a good college with a public school education (and the schools where I lived weren't great by any stretch), my parents homeschooled me and then paid for me to go to the best school in the area when I knew more than they could teach. As I've grown older, I realize what a great advantage that was, and I'd like to give my kids the same. Even if they don't do anything with that chance, I don't ever want anyone to be able to say ""yeah, Barton - but you didn't do &#60;blank&#62; for your kids.""<p>That's my paramount goal. I have subordinate goals to that, but they're expendable given the greater good. For instance I'd like to get better at math and eventually get an M.S. in math of some sort to complement my M.S. in CS. That would open the door to what I consider more interesting work, but there's no guarantee it would be higher paying than the sort of work I do now. I'd also like to eventually run my own business doing work in scientific computing or some other highly technical arena, but that entails a degree of risk that makes it more of an endgame plan for me. I'd like to finish the marathon I was training for before I tore my PCL in 2005, but I don't have the time in my life now for the training regimen I was on (75 miles a week). I'd like to be fluent in Latin again like I was 5 years ago, but again - there's too few hours in the day for something that doesn't get me closer to my primary goal.

D in aeronautical engineering from Stanford, taught math there for a while and contributed to the analysis of the Tacoma Narrows disaster (he worked out some aspects of a phenomenon called flutter in his dissertation).

I have seen him read the answer to a cryptogram nearly as easily as if it were English. He's 85, and I am perpetually astonished at how sharp his mind is. It's going to be an enormous loss when he eventually passes, and frankly I'm not sure how I'm going to handle the fact that, when he goes, all that knowledge and skill will be gone as well.

37,"Argh. This is what I don't like about non-tech, -IT, and -CS articles posted on HN: people go off on tangents with so little (useless) information. I'm sorry to say this article is poor on information.<p>Let's stick to the facts. Complex carbs (brown rice, whole wheat bread, bagels, whole wheat pasta, beans - the list of delicious, healthy complex carbs is long) in moderation does not hinder your health. In fact, your body needs them because it is stored energy. Other sources of energy are used up quicker, such as protein. That's not to say carbs are better than protein. Your body needs both!<p>Now, refined SIMPLE carbs (table sugar, fruit juice, ""packaged"" cereals, chocolate bars, etc.) are not good for you, and only certain types of bodies with certain physical activity should consume them (e.g., if you are a bodybuilder or if you lift weights a few times a week, etc.). It is still absolutely tantamount that you consume unrefined simple carbs such as strawberries, raspberries, oranges, apples, plum, pear, a long etc., and the number one fruit because of its flavanoid content: blueberries!).<p>Put simply, fruits and complex carbs help you convert what you eat in slow-releasing energy that has less content that is turned into fat (as opposed to refined simple carbs). This steady release of energy is part of ""moderation is key"". If you have your body working too hard, your heart fluttering/palpitations and overworking it are not healthy, neither is when your body processes everything too slow.<p>The biggest factor when consuming carbs (both simple and complex) is the glycemic levels in your blood. You can't have this fluctuate so much, especially if you're pre-disposed to it, otherwise you throw it out of kilter and it may cause diabetes.<p>I'll keep the fat part short. We need fat, too! Let me be less ""headliney"". We need polyunsaturated fatty acids; in part, to keep our metabolism going. Foods like avocado, fish, flax seed, leafy vegetables, soybeans, walnuts (nuts), and shellfish. Sure, saturated fats may not be the major cause of heart disease, but lessening it while consuming a healthy amount of polyunsaturated fat and complex carbs might. You can read an article on that here (it's better than the OP's article, but still has its flaws): <a href=""http://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/health/rethinking-saturated-fat-its-not-your-hearts-enemy/article1462757/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/health/rethinking-satura...</a> (By the way, this article was published over a year ago.)<p>Having said all that, each body is different. You should tailor your diet to what your body reacts positively to. For example, flax seed is healthy for you, but I know people who get diarrhea from it. Obviously, don't force yourself to eat something your body doesn't like. Listen to your body, because, unfortunately, the science doesn't fully understand all body types.<p>I'm not a fan of fallacies from defective induction, so I shall refrain from an argumentum ad verecundiam on this, but on a separate note, I will say my friend studied nutrition and she has expressed a keen dislike toward the ""Food guide pyramid"".",2011-05-20 15:09:23
38,"The article misses that this is fundamentally an issue with the PHY level of ""mobile"" broadband systems.<p>If you've got a very simple radio,  say, a ham 2 meter handset,  you find there are interference patterns caused by multipath interference that cause the signal to get stronger and weaker as you move half a wavelength this way or that way.

On the other hand,  if you're trying to send as much data as you possibly can in the bandwidth you've got,  you're ultimately going to implement something like OFDM.  Now,  in an OFDM system,  you're using frequencies in parallel to transmit more data,  not to improve robustness.  If you're sitting in one place your system can figure out what the fading is and work around it.  If you're moving,  the relative performance of the subchannels is always changing too fast for OFDM to work.<p>This is how you can have a good voice connection on your phone (which is using a PHY truly built for mobile operation) but not have it on for data (which is using a PHY built for high performance operation from a fixed point.)",2011-06-27 14:34:17

47,"These posts are exceptionally well-timed for me. I'm currently wrangling with one of those problems that is just not solved well with relational databases, or even the flat document store that my company already uses. I've been looking hard at Redis and Mongo, and of late I'm leaning towards Mongo. You know what? Having read these posts and the threads - and having extracted what little in the way of factual datapoints I could from them - I'm pretty sure I'll still be riding into production with Mongo.<p>Some of you guys who were all aboard the NOSQL UBER ALLES hype train a year or two ago now seem to be swinging back - with scrapes and bruises from some truly harebrained misdeployments, no doubt - to a reactionary 'All NoSQL are doomed to reimplement everything relational' nihilism. Back to shitty OR tools and ugly-ass joins for everyone, damnit! Harumph. I could write a novel just quoting and responding to some of the stupid pronouncements and prescriptions for correctness on these Mongo threads' comments.<p>Anyways. With regards to this specific post:<p>Let's rewind a couple of years. I work for a significantly smaller company than our anon raconteur, from the sound of it. At roughly the same time as he adopted Mongo, I was also looking hard at it, to solve some problems where the relational options available to us weren't going to cut the mustard. Damn, did Mongo look cool, fun even. The flexibility of having arbitrary object graphs in it and querying down into subdocument properties with real indexing on them, well, it sets nearly any developer's heart a-flutter, particularly those of us who work on dynamic web stuff a fair bit.<p>Sadly, I have to be an engineer and pragmatist first, I have to think about much more than what is sexy and comfortable for devs. I've been through my share of 3AM wake-up world-enders, I've learned the hard lessons. I considered variables like basic maintainability by ops people, credibility of the vendor, track record, robust redundancy and availability solutions, how far up shit creek we'd be in a disaster recovery scenario, etc. And after thorough research I decided that, for my much smaller company which can afford to be judiciously bleeding-edge where it makes sense to, Mongo was just not clearing the bar. I sucked it up and used unsexy properly normalized relational database tables, then utilized memory caching and async updates to try and paper over the performance issues inherent in that scheme.<p>What was anon doing? Charging full steam ahead into the wild unknown with Mongo, on an effort that was apparently important to a userbase of millions at a ""high profile"" company. That's some mighty responsible stewardship of the company, or even just the IT department's, broader concerns right there. Now, I understand that it totally makes sense to have used Mongo 1.x as a scrappy startup on a greenfield project, no problem. But this guy was in a different situation. At that scale in a BFC, conservatism rules, and it rules for a reason.<p>I think I am starting to understand why anon is anon.<p>In any case, we're likely going to roll with Mongo soon. It is indeed maturing, and I'm a lot more comfortable with it on all of my criteria these days. I have possibly read more of the JIRA issues than some of the devs, and they are prioritizing the Right Things - at least for my tastes. By my estimation it is on the right track.<p>Even having not <i>used</i> it in production yet, I can identify some things people are complaining about here as complete and utter RTFM-fail, misunderstanding of what it is they're deploying and whether what they expect out of it is realistic before they begin. I understand the tradeoffs of Mongo, and in my particular situation they make good sense.",2011-11-06 16:10:36

For the universe, the span of your life <i>should</i> have been not even the fluttering of an eyelash before a blink. From a cosmic perspective, the existence of our whole galaxy was set to be one giant quantum fluctuation - the birth and death of a mere grain of matter, falling from one eon to another.<p>But then something incredible, something unexplainable, happened. Inanimate matter came forth from the deep waters. It grew legs, it started to <i>paint</i> on cave walls, not yet aware of the implications of what it was doing. (Have you ever wondered - of all the things the most significant cluster of particles in the whole universe could do, why would they choose to paint?) <i>We</i> started to reproduce. We started to <i>communicate</i>, to <i>love</i>, to <i>build</i>, to <i>live</i>!

You alone - a lonely <i>sentient</i> creature - would be that blinding flash of light even if the rest of us had never existed. The wonder of you, even as you contemplated an end to your solitary existence, would fill space long after every sun died and time itself drew to an end. In such a universe, you alone would have been notable. The fact of your existence is more incredible than the largest sun or the most massive black hole. Your glory - the glory of us all - will fill the universe forever, a single proud memory in the vast emptiness of space.<p>We tend to take our existence for granted, but it is an incredible fact - a miracle which all the religions on Earth were born, or given to us, in order to explain. Who would have thought? Who could have guessed that this tiny backwater planet on a spiral arm of the Milky Way would end up defining the vast cosmos forever?<p>Now, here is the important part: All the dead matter in the cosmos - every particle of the sun, the galaxy, and the vast <i>everything</i> - would give it up to be you. Sagittarius A* would disappear in an instant, if it could change places. It would give 13.2 billion years of existence for your measly 120 years of life.<p>Your life, unfortunately, will some day draw to an end. You know that, your atoms know that. Perhaps you are tempted to end it earlier, but no mistake could be more grave. I know not what you believe, but even if there is heaven or hell, there wont be anything like <i>now</i>. Let your atoms live. They have eternity itself to be inanimate.<p>A handful of misfiring neurons has no right to bring you to an end. The world is blinding. If your neurons can't see, you must do everything you can to fix them. Depression has easy medical fixes. Being treated for depression, fixing such a tiny flaw, may be the hardest challenge you ever face - but it is minor in the grand perspective.<p>Lastly, I leave the cosmos behind and appeal to you. Whoever you are, however you came into existence, and no matter what your purpose is, you are capable of understanding deep philosophical arguments and complex equations. I have none of that for you, merely a saying often heard on HN or in rejection therapy groups: <i>Never say no.</i> Ask yourself what is necessary to make life worth it. If you need a vacation to Hawaii to make life enjoyable again, take the next plane to Hawaii. If you cannot live in a meaningless world, leave for the mountains of India, where you may seek enlightenment in silence among fellow travelers in the sanctity of a Buddhist monastery. The parent posts' comment on marijuana is right on, but free will can do more than justify life - it can make it as brilliant and wonderful as you desire.  The universe envies your ability to choose.<p>Before I end, I want to point out that all of you left comments here instead of suffering in silence. You are already ahead of the game. You can email me at aantny@gmail.com anytime. If you email me or call me on Skype, you would be helping <i>me</i> take a break from schoolwork to discuss philosophy.

66,"The abstraction of ""jobs"" from ""the things we do to survive"" is interesting. The only things we ""need"" to do are reproduce, and find food and shelter towards that end. It's crazy that we have blown past the struggle for survival so far it's almost been forgotten, like the binary code under our lovely Ruby scripts.<p>But we still feel the flutter of our primal fears for survival, even in the abstraction, and fight to the death over increasingly excessive piles of wealth, as if we might not ""survive"". And because we do that, in the global picture not everyone DOES survive. If you are convinced you do not have enough to survive, it's very hard to share.<p>Even worse, as our personal bar of ""survival"" continues to rise in this abstract world, our frantic and instinctual struggle to ""survive"" is apparently driving us towards an incredibly sad and ironic demise - if you believe the headlines about nuclear war and global warming.<p>I agree with the article's idea that as technology takes care of more and more basic needs we should move to ""information-based products"" to keep ourselves busy and satisfied. We have to. All the world's billions can't have two cars in the garage, but they can all have giant digital art and music collections. (I guess we could do more recreation/sporting too, that's not a finite resource.)<p>But it's another level of abstraction. How far can we get from our concrete instincts for food and babies and still find sufficient meaning and purpose?",2012-03-19 03:20:06

68,"Body modification? Pacemaker here.<p>Every six months I have to go in for a tuneup, a wireless data dump &#38; service testing. Having having one's heart slowed to sub-40bpm via a few taps on a screen is...odd. Printed report tells assorted stories of daily activity periods, odd events, heart rate hitting programmed thresholds, etc. There have been some confluence of proximity &#38; programming causing twitching under some circumstances (couldn't sleep on my left side for a year due to a lead pressing on &#38; convulsing diaphragm) which were fixed completely thru software settings. Have a minimum threshold programmed in, and if it's set too high (say, 60bpm) and I relax deeply can feel it kicking in with ""go faster!""<p>Proved quite useful a couple weeks back. Suffered a random onset of aortic flutter (can happen to anyone, just sorta happens), where a natural short-circuit in the beat-signal nerves sent the heart rate up to 349bpm (neatly documented on the printed data dump). For most people, this means a very scary and tense race to the emergency room, with AED paddles &#38; drugs to bring it down until the problem can be surgically eliminated. My pacemaker hit the brakes at 150bpm, leaving me functional to wander in to the ER at my convenience; there, a tech was brought in to set up a more aggressive flutter-control program (70-100bpm more aware of actual physical needs). That kept things manageable until the drive-thru heart surgery to fix the problem (1 hour to send a probe up a vein to find &#38; burn out the short, 3 hours rest, then discharged). Wasn't what the pacer was installed to handle (ventricular resynchronization), but the ""while we're installing this, let's add a wire and program in some other someday-useful stuff"" has indeed proven useful.<p>Other body modification is a mechanical heart valve. I tick. I've been confused with clocks.<p>Yes, MRIs are completely out of the question now. Work near a small one and get nervous walking by the door.<p>OK, so these weren't exactly voluntary. Choice aside, being a cyborg does make for interesting experiences &#38; conversations.<p>ETA: BTW, not looking forward to replacing the battery. At least the device has been saying the battery will last another four years - for the last four years.",2012-03-21 17:33:48

70,Really no flutter on this list? These are all great companies but I think flutter deserves a spot as a company with potential to really change how we interact with our devices.

72,"That's an interesting perspective. I agree we have gone through cycles of centralization/decentralization and that events will cause flutters of movement in both directions, that's natural. As another comment mentioned, a hybrid approach will likely be a strong story in the years to come.<p>However the real <i>purpose</i> of innovation is not to simply drive price down, rather, to create enabling technologies that move mankind forward and allow people to do things they've never even imagined. We're seeing massive things with massive processing power and data, all while someone else manages that infrastructure, who LOVES managing things at scale, who I can't afford to hire an who has become the expert I never will be.<p>If the goal is simply to reduce cost, then we aren't creating something big.

73,"To anyone who sees the above comment: this is a classic troll comment. The user 'tptacek' can't think of any flaws in this idea, but because it isn't his own, and because his inability to find any flaws causes him frustration, he feels the need to denigrate the idea by calling it ""silly"". It isn't particularly clear A) why the so-called ""pepper"" method would be inferior to some others and B) why it couldn't be combined with tptacek's suggestions.<p>Even in tptacek's follow-up comment further down, there is still not even a single reason given as to why one of these ideas is inferior to another. If you are comparing ideas X and Y, and you think X is inferior to Y, you cannot demonstrate that fact to others by saying ""Y is a great idea"" because X may be an equally great idea, even if you think it is ""silly"" and you ""condescend"" to it.<p>This is the difference between good writing and bad writing.<p>A bad writer will tell you how to fell (""John and Cindy sat outside, watched the amazing sunset, and felt happy to be together"")<p>A good writer will <i>make</i> you feel something. Here is a cheesy example, this might work if you dig 90210, dubious in these parts, I admit. Or it just might induce nausea... (""John looked out at the sunset. Rays of light spilled through the clouds and over the rust-colored hills. A bird chirped twice in the distance by the lone birch tree before fluttering off. He could just barely make out a mark on on the tree. He turned to Cindy and asked 'Can you see it, where I carved our initials?' She looked out toward the tree and smiled. She looked over and cooed ""Aww..."", and then she snuggle-leaned into him."")<p>Good writing is a lot of work, but the alternative is to look like a jerk /Fezzik",2012-04-07 05:05:29
74,"I think the overall layout and color palette is great.<p>I'd like to suggest some improvements to the marketing message, however, since you've included that in the purview of your proposal this time.<p>I'm not crazy about the Jedi-themed language in the official copy, as it distracts from what the product actually does. My mind wants to be learning how the product works, not wondering how it cleverly relates to futurist mythology (as much as I am a fan). However, I think the Jedi themed testimonial is entirely appropriate, as it is of lower weight in the informational hierarchy and is an individual's statement, not the company's.<p>Lastly, the ""Yes, master"" blurb is not appropriate as official marketing copy, even if it is intended as an ironic reference to the Jedi master-apprentice relationship. It is too easy to mistake it for a reference to a master-slave relationship, which is not a good association in any respect. It's just not an issue you want to draw association with even in the slightest most oblique way. The lesson here is that all copy must be screened for any kind of irrelevant connotation.<p>I do like the direction in which you're going with the copy in the left hand column below the main section. That's starting to develop a fun, snappy voice, and the fish graphic is pleasantly quirky.<p>Lastly, to maximize the ""throughput of information"" about the product that one gets by just looking at the page ""above the fold"", I would make the main graphic more explanatory (possibly with little blurbs like you used for ""yes, master""). The main graphic on their existing page <a href=""https://flutter.io/signup"" rel=""nofollow"">https://flutter.io/signup</a> was good in that regard.<p>Kudos to you doing these designs every week. I think it's a great exercise. Just remember that it's not just about the pixels, it's the total message and then of course the whole UX after you interact with the page.",2012-04-13 18:42:03

76,"I'm as big a critic of the ""Security Theatre"" as the next guy, but trying to fight bollocks with even higher-grade bollocks isn't really very helpful. And Charlie's ""white-hot supersonic shrapnel"" is bollocks of the purest sort. A surface-to-air missile -- after its fuel is burnt out and its payload is detonated -- is basically nothing more than a thin tube. The ""shrapnel"" would consist of lightweight scraps of carbon fibre and sheet metal, fluttering downward like ordinary carbon fibre and sheet metal.

Should be easy to integrate with 3rd party apps.<p>- Performance.<p>Leap already has an edge in that they are releasing a SDK, Flutter should follow this quickly (hopefully).

94,"Pardon me for a shameless plug here, but I had jump in as this is an interesting discussion where we have at Flutter have long thought about it.  We came up with a simple gesture to play/pause a song (itunes/spotify) by asking thousands of humans what gesture they would use if they did not have mouse/keyboard/voice.  Almost everyone came up with the one we picked...  even for next set of gesture, we're looking at static human gestures that are micro and intuitive (and doesn't make you fatigued).<p>When we released the first app, we got countless emails asking for hand-swipe as a next song gesture.  We had felt a long ago that even though it seems natural it is completely impractical in certain context (i.e. coffee shop) and doing hand swipe 20 times starts to wear you down.

97,"By broad point was not really clear, but could simply be stated as:<p>We will make a lot of assumptions about what is a linear expense, linear threat etc. without really knowing what will be linear until we pack an extremely tight grouping of cars on the road.<p>Taking my point further:<p>For road work, expense may go from linear to nonlinear because of something that seems completely counterintuitive.  Imagine every car now has variation in the exact placement within the lanes.  Highways have marks where the majority of cars drive, but variation in drivers accounts for variation in path.  If every robot executed their driving in the exact 1 foot per tire space, it is likely that 1 foot per tire space would require a greater than linear road work.  This could be solved by programing an automatic variation in all cars or possibly changing how roads are built so that they require only cement in those 1 foot areas.<p>Now, an example of a time when engineers thought they had it right, but didnt think of everything:<p>Engineering has come a long way since the Tacoma bridge incedent, but we cannot underestimate what assumptions were previously made that will be incorrect when we start driving far more vehicles on roads.  In the Tacoma bridge edge case, sustained winds caused flutter (self-feeding vibration) which caused the bridge to fail.<p>While I do not suggest this is a likely case, the fact is, we are probably not considering everything and there will be issues we do not foresee, but we should try to eliminate as many edge cases as possible.<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zczJXSxnw"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zczJXSxnw</a>

In a situation where a truck on the highway has a blowout which causes large debris to separate from the truck, the robots still need some room to slow down.  In the extreme example where cars are 1 foot away from each other, an accident like that would have tremendous negative consequences that even robots would have a tough time dealing with.<p>We will have self-driving cars, and they will likely be much safer than human operated cars, but we are going to also have setbacks and many of them can be avoided by looking to the future and trying to solve the problems early rather than later.",2012-09-04 21:15:26

Go bind your sons to exile
To serve your captives' need;
To wait in heavy harness,
On fluttered folk and wild--
Your new-caught, sullen peoples,
Half-devil and half-child.<p>Take up the White Man's burden--
In patience to abide,
To veil the threat of terror
And check the show of pride;
By open speech and simple,
An hundred times made plain
To seek another's profit,
And work another's gain.<p>Take up the White Man's burden--
The savage wars of peace--
Fill full the mouth of Famine
And bid the sickness cease;
And when your goal is nearest
The end for others sought,
Watch sloth and heathen Folly
Bring all your hopes to nought.<p>Take up the White Man's burden--
No tawdry rule of kings,
But toil of serf and sweeper--
The tale of common things.
The ports ye shall not enter,
The roads ye shall not tread,
Go mark them with your living,
And mark them with your dead.<p>Take up the White Man's burden--
And reap his old reward:
The blame of those ye better,
The hate of those ye guard--
The cry of hosts ye humour
(Ah, slowly!) toward the light:--
""Why brought he us from bondage,
Our loved Egyptian night?""<p>Take up the White Man's burden--
Ye dare not stoop to less--
Nor call too loud on Freedom
To cloke your weariness;

By all ye leave or do,

The easy, ungrudged praise.

All night the conversation fluttered around nappies and toddler-proofing houses and more stuff about dealing with baby poo and vomit and whatnot.<p>On the one hand, it's fine, because these are new sets of parents using a pressure release valve, but on the other hand, it's screamingly boring because I've had to deal with the exact same conversation with new parents throughout my life. Try and change the topic and it comes back to baby vomit on the car seats or how the cat doesn't deal well with fistfuls of fur pulled out of her. It's not socially acceptable to indicate that it's boring to be in this conversation yet again - because to <i>these</i> parents, <i>these</i> kids are special. Which is fine, for them, but for me, the only thing that ever changes are the names.<p>I guess this is a long-winded way of saying that the ragging on having kids is also an escape valve; that it's a way of highlighting that not having kids is also a valid life choice rather than just bearing it silently.

124,"Having a pacemaker, I've been quietly paranoid about <i>any</i> magnets coming anywhere close to it. That includes keeping the iPad away from the area, both because of magnets and the radio transmitter.<p>One of the first warnings I got about having one was to not dangle earbuds around my neck where they would hang in front of my left shoulder. Other warnings about keeping distance from generators, magnets, shoulder-pressed cell phones, store theft-deterrent sensors, and even chainsaws (cardiologist &#38; I got a kick out of wondering which would kill me first: the alternator's fields knocking out the pacer, or my passed-out fall into the still-spinning blade). MRIs...just don't even go there.<p>The problem with magnets is more complex than perhaps obvious. There's bad input, and then there's damage. What the girl is referring to is quite legitimate: defibrillators and pacemakers typically allow proximity of a magnet as a ""master override"" function. When I suffered an unrelated instance of atrial flutter (heart decided to run at 350bpm, pacemaker hit the brakes at 150...for 12 hours), the ER doc not having a diagnostic system handy forced the pacemaker to reduce to a much more humane rate by placing a good-sized magnet over the pacemaker; this allowed a more relaxed 2-hour wait for a technician to arrive and better diagnose &#38; manage the problem (the subsequent drive-thru heart surgery is another story). She's raising awareness that sometimes this ""master override"" function can be induced improperly and even unknowingly, leaving the patient in a high-risk condition without knowing until periodic diagnostics or medical failure. A related issue she may tangentially raise awareness of is outright damage, with induced currents overstimulating the patient or frying the electronics (see aforementioned chainsaw issue).<p>She's raising a good issue. With the proliferation of tiny super-magnets, an enduring technical problem must be revisited: how to provide a low/no-impact way to essentially ""hit the reset button"" on an implanted medical device when there is no visible/external contacts? Not long ago, using a strong magnet to activate a magnetic switch was a sensible solution. Today, stronger magnetic fields are coming closer more often, risking activating a ""safe/master mode"", and there's not much way to alert anyone to the condition.<p>To address a few other points: Yes, any small but strong magnets like the magsafe plug are a possible problem. It's not an EMI problem so much as false input to a magnetic sensor. Defibrillators and pacemakers face the same basic problem, but the former moreso because the ""master override"" function needed is a function shutdown (need a way to turn it off and keep it off), while the latter responds in a more benign manner.<p>Glad to hear someone raising awareness of the issue. Amused that it's a child figuring it out and publicizing it. Thanks, kid!",2013-05-09 21:07:48

I was worried at first when browsers started implementing it, fearing useless and insipid animations would sprawl around the web (like some jQuery ones). But like anything, if used sparingly, animations can improve an interface. Apart from adding life and being &quot;cool&quot; (probably the reason why designers implement them in the first place), animations add interactivity and affordance. Plus, they&#x27;re less prone to bugs because the code is easier to read and write than jQuery alternatives, and the browsers&#x27; rendering engine usually prevents unwanted fluttering and infinite loops from happening.",2013-06-14 12:28:17

Recently I spent a few weeks experimenting with e-cigs to see if I could get the nicotine high that I remember enjoying without my body feeling like crap.  No dice. Puffing on nice-tasting, pleasant smelling nicotine vapor still made my body feel like crap at times, just like it did when I smoked analog cigarettes.  I didn&#x27;t feel it in my lungs so much, but I did feel like my blood pressure was elevated and my heart was a bit fluttery, and once it gave me a rather bad headache. A few times it felt really nice, like I remembered, but mostly I felt like I was just chasing that feeling, and not really receiving the satisfaction I wanted.<p>I canceled the experiment and gave my gear to a friend who still smoked analog cigarettes.

129,"I&#x27;m getting a lot of replies that are confused as to just what a conspiracy theory is, so I thought it would be worth following up to elaborate on that.<p>People seem to think that a conspiracy theory is about <i>what</i> is being theorized. The moon landing was faked. 9&#x2F;11 was an inside job. The NSA is recording every American phone call.<p>But that&#x27;s not it at all. It&#x27;s not about <i>what</i> you theorize, it&#x27;s about <i>how</i>. A sane and considered theory that leads to a crazy-seeming conclusion is not a conspiracy. Similarly, an insane theory that leads to a correct conclusion is still a conspiracy theory.<p>Some examples. Saying that the moon landing was faked because the flag was &quot;fluttering&quot; and there are no stars in the photographs is a conspiracy theory. Saying that the moon landing may have been faked because, say, you managed to get ahold of a secret memo from JFK discussing the possibility of faking it, would not be a conspiracy theory.<p>Similarly, saying that the NSA is spying on everybody because of the testimony and documentation provided by a whistleblower is not a conspiracy theory. However, saying that the NSA is spying on everybody because all the numbers in your e-mail header add up to 666 is a conspiracy theory.<p>What it comes down to is how you interpret the evidence. If you interpret it sanely, then it&#x27;s not a conspiracy theory. If you twist mundane things to build narratives that are not justified by the evidence, then it&#x27;s a conspiracy theory.<p>That is what&#x27;s happening with this story. Is it possible that this person was assassinated by the US government? Sure. Is that theory supported by the evidence discussed by this article and other similar articles posted to HN over the past few weeks? Not even a little bit. And <i>that</i>, not the supposed outlandishness of the conclusion, is what makes this a &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; that is not worth paying attention to and frankly not worth making it to the front page of HN.<p>If an article on this matter shows up that <i>sanely</i> analyzes the evidence and comes up with the conclusion that it was probably an assassination, I&#x27;d love to see it on the front page.

But what do you do when it&#x27;s a night shift and the only flight systems engineer on duty who is officially qualified to perform certain operations is from the UK? You get a piece of foam, cut it to the size and shape of the display, and write &quot;BRIT BLOCKER&quot; on it in sharpie, and use it whenever the Brits are around.<p>Further absurdity kicked in when some of the first jets built specifically for the UK were tested.

137,"Hey HN! I&#x27;m the creator and co-founder of this project. I&#x27;ve been designing robots since I was 15 and hacking on electronics since I could hold a screwdriver. What I think you&#x27;ll like most about this project is the open source long range encrypted wireless link our mesh provides. I discovered Hacker News about a year ago and have been a regular reader since, so I remember Cryptocat, the NSA, and all the other things that reminded us why cryptography is important, and why implementing it is critical.<p>So, a few answers:<p>Yes, you can do encrypted mesh networks over long range. I&#x27;m a hardcore robotics guy at heart - the name &quot;Flutter&quot; was chosen exactly because this protocol is designed to be as lightweight as possible, and though the mesh protocol itself is still being developed (basically, that&#x27;s why we need kickstarter, aside from the fact that I&#x27;m tired of ramen), I really intend for the protocol to stay out of the way. You&#x27;ll also have full control over what happens, so you can always turn meshing off and use hard addressing. It&#x27;s still really simple to use that way and cheaper than everything else I&#x27;ve seen that compares.<p>I absolutely will not sell a product as &quot;cryptographically secure&quot; unless I believe it is, and I understand that the &quot;smallest&quot; flaw in a cryptographic system can render the entire system worthless. I am learning everything I can about cryptography, starting with some amazing e-books I have found on the subject, and just like wireless<p>Our data rate is proportional to our range (this is generally true for any radio system), so we get 1km range at low data rates (1200baud tested, but we physically ran out of test room and had a strong signal). Theoretically this radio can do 3km at 1200 baud and it looks like we should be able to do 1km at 30kbps at least. Also I think the new radio chip doubles all the data rates in these cases (I would have to confirm), and I do know the new chip has higher transmit power and higher sensitivity, so range should be even better.<p>There is a cheap radio amplifier (PA and LNA) called the CC1190, and texas instruments has all kinds of datasheets on using either of the two radios we are working with to give us 10km range, or much better data rates at 1km, etc. We&#x27;re going to design the protocol with expansion in that direction in mind, if people really dig the range thing (it&#x27;s a bit much for a beer brew setup, but if you want dark meshnets, lets do it!)<p>I&#x27;m a hacker at heart. I first learned lockpicking at the old Noisebridge location (the original one). I love 3D printers and open source, did a rant&#x2F;thread about open hardware on the Ultimaker mailing list a year back (I was one of the first in the bay area to get an Ultimaker too, and designed a new mount for it that I have on thingiverse). I got on hackaday for some 3d printed helicopter blades, and have been building robots since I was 15. There&#x27;s a longer bio about me on our site, at flutterwireless.com<p>See also me ten years ago talking about robots (and I feel silly for the &quot;few people do&quot; comment, but I was 15 and trying to keep it simple).

Were teaching these things because these technologies are so ubiquitous and important, that it will benefit everyone to have a little understanding of them.<p>I don&#x27;t know what your computer science education was, but the fundamental idea in mine was &quot;learning how to take an idea in your head and turn it into a program.&quot; The principles were not networks, databases, and protocols, but rather modularization, reuse, clarity, and algorithm analysis. You think refining these tools is not important?<p>You give an example:<p>&gt; If I was to shuffle a pack of fifty-two playing cards and hand them to you, then asked you to sort them, youd do what any sensible person on the planet would do. Youd sort them into suit order first, then into value order.<p>The point of computational thinking is that you can concretely analyze <i>how good</i> this method is and compare it with others (I&#x27;m sure you know the tradeoffs involved in sorting!). Of course everyone knows how to naturally decompose things, but reasoning about it and handling adversarial cases, that&#x27;s where computational thinking comes in.<p>Computational thinking (forget the Popular Title, just the idea of applying computational ideas elsewhere in life) is <i>extremely valuable</i>, and I&#x27;ll give you two prominent examples: the first in the design of fair markets, which has revolutionized more than one industry [1], and the design of new computers, such as quantum computers and DNA computing [2]. I can continue: computational thinking is applied in designing fun games (not just in programming them!), art and product design, literally every optimization problem in every industry, cognitive psychology, the study of evolution, political analysis, information and security, and so on. I can give you references and examples if you want.<p>You would rather call Computer Science &quot;what it is&quot; and omit these opportunities for people who don&#x27;t want to be software engineers their entire life?

The truth is that computational systems are everywhere in life, and being able to recognize, formalize, and analyze them are what makes computational thinking useful. It&#x27;s not just about writing programs.<p>Maybe your point is that we should separate the two fields: instead of one big Computer Science degree we should have Software Engineering which is just about programming and Theoretical Computer Science which is just about the mathematics and Applied Computer Science which is about the other stuff.

163,"&gt; FWIW the words pull and push are used in sailing training to emphasize the importance of keeping the leeward flow attached when going to weather.<p>Ding ding ding! Sailing is a practical matter, for nearly all sailors. It&#x27;s nearly a folk activity. The models that are used to transmit and retain that information have more to do with achieving results than with achieving <i>theoretical understanding</i>. The trouble only really comes in when we try to use these pragmatic models as scientific models!<p>&gt; Assuming the flow is attached on the leeward side, does that side also turn flow and generate force?<p>Notionally, yes. To be theoretical, attached flow on the leeward side is going to exert <i>less pressure</i> than detached flow would, due to irreversibilities in the detached turbulent flow. To be even stricter, because the equations of subsonic flow are elliptical and not hyperbolic, a mess of detached flow on the leeward side is going to jam up the whole works, even upstream and to windward.<p>The difficulty comes in when we try to mentally divide the flow between the windward and leeward sides of the sail. (Additional difficulty comes in because the &quot;adverse pressure gradient&quot; is essential to understanding this, but is tricky enough that it would probably do more harm than good to talk about it to sailing students. The first rule of Sailing Club is that you do not talk about the adverse pressure gradient. The second rule of....)<p>In practice, &quot;[k]eeping the leeward flow attached&quot; really amounts to &quot;not stalling the sail.&quot; This is probably more important when sailing to windward because you&#x27;re running as close to a stall as you can (at as high an angle of attack as you can) in order to point as high as you can. Also, with the sheets reefed in and with the higher apparent wind, the sail is more likely to be distorted. This can result in one part of the sail being stalled. Once one part stalls, the increased pressure in that area is likely to inject turbulent flow into neighboring areas that might otherwise not be stalled.<p>Another thing to consider is that there&#x27;s something filling in that area of detached flow. Guess where it comes from? The windward side of the sail via the trailing edge. While the flow has to come off the leech in the direction of the leech, nature is a bit lest strict about what it does right after; It can get turned completely around, in short order, to fill that void behind the sail. The only thing it requires is that its turning radius not be unreasonably small. Congratulations! You&#x27;ve just (1) injected higher-pressure air into the lee, and equivalently (2) stopped turning the flow on the windward side. Because of (2), you can bet that there&#x27;s an equivalent drop in pressure on the windward side as well.<p>That was the pragmatic way of understanding things. Now, I&#x27;m going to break the first rule of Sailing Club. When a flow is adjacent to a surface, the flow stops at the surface. That is, a 10 knot breeze blowing over your sail comes to a halt <i>at the part of the breeze that contacts the sail</i>. Because the adjacent flow hasn&#x27;t touched the surface, it tries to maintain its 10 knots. However, nature is sticky. Any time there are adjacent regions of flow traveling at different velocities--any time there is a <i>velocity gradient</i>--viscosity tries to average things out: The flow right next to the sail is nearly stopped; The bit next to that is traveling a bit faster; And so on. (Incidentally, on a larger scale, this is why the wind is stronger aloft than on the deck. You&#x27;re in the boundary layer, as it&#x27;s called.) All of this viscous transfer is <i>doing work on the flow</i>. Doing work raises pressure. Because this happens <i>as the flow moves downstream</i>, more work is done on the flow the farther you get from the luff, and the higher the pressure gets. I don&#x27;t think I need to convince you that fluids like to go away from high pressure to lower pressure. That is, fluids like to follow <i>pressure gradients</i>. And <i>adverse pressure gradient</i> can stop, and even reverse a flow. Note that this is likely to happen at the surface in question. Typically, the flow on the windward side has a stronger favorable pressure gradient to start with, and so can tolerate the adverse contributions of the viscous boundary layer without becoming detached. Because the point of a sail is to have lower pressure on the leeward side, there&#x27;s less <i>total pressure</i> available to start with to overcome the adverse pressure gradient, and the flow can become detached on the back side of the sail.<p>This detached condition is called, in aeronautical terms, a &quot;stall&quot;.<p>Just sheet in until the telltales flutter, and then back off until they don&#x27;t. If that doesn&#x27;t work, play with the vang until it does. ;)",2014-10-09 01:13:34

The feather is an elastic object (to a first approximation). When the feather is hung, there&#x27;s internal tension keeping it stationary and giving its shape. When the feather is unhooked, this internal tension doesn&#x27;t just disappear instantaneously, rather an elastic wave travels through the feather at the speed of sound in the feather. Because the feather is not a perfect elastic medium, the effect you see is a damped harmonic oscillator, but it takes non-zero finite time to dampen sufficiently.<p>This is true for the big ball too, except that the speed of sound is orders of magnitude faster in it, and the spring constant of the material (steel?) is also many order of magnitude larger than the spring constant of the feather.<p>The center of mass of both objects falls at the same rate.

After getting to watch a live X-ray of my heart, had open-heart surgery (which my boss wanted me to take as a vacation day), had an <i>external</i> pacemaker attached for 3 days (whatever happens, don&#x27;t pull those wires out...hey, stop turning that &quot;pulse rate&quot; dial!!!), and then had the pacemaker installed.

175,"(Hope the Unicode math symbols appear correctly. )<p>&gt; After the feather is released, the feather is gravityless (in the non inertial reference frame) so the barbules go to their natural position, so they go &quot;up&quot;, but only slightly and the flutter is minimal.<p>You&#x27;re saying the same thing as I did in different words, in fact my analysis was also in the accelerating frame :-).<p>So, in the accelerating frame at t=0 (the drop), we have an deformed elastic object that acts very similar to a harmonic oscillator, with some initial deformation x. It&#x27;s not exactly a simple harmonic oscillator because the mass is distributed throughout, and the effective mass is <i>NOT</i> the mass of the spring (in fact it&#x27;s one third of that), but it&#x27;s relatively easy to show it moves like one (to the first degree for small displacements), albeit not in a Hacker News discussion. It will move according to<p><pre><code>    D[x] + 2D[x] + x = 0
</code></pre>
where =c&#x2F;2(mk) is the damping ratio, =(k&#x2F;m) is the undamped angular frequency and m is the effective mass. For a feather, it might well be that the oscillator is overdamped, of course. The ball most certainly has a much larger Q factor than the feather.<p>Elasticity and sound waves are very closely related. Sound is a particular kind of wave traveling through an elastic medium. For an approximately linear object, we only have longitudinal waves that move with c=(Y&#x2F;). Y is Young&#x27;s modulus and  is the density. You can immediately see that small values of Y give rise to small values of c.<p>For ideal springs of length X and cross-section S we can prove that (exercise left to the reader) that:<p><pre><code>    Y = Xk&#x2F;S
</code></pre>
so<p><pre><code>    kx&#x2F;S = Y x&#x2F;X =&gt; F&#x2F;S = Y x&#x2F;X =&gt; Y = FX&#x2F;Sx
</code></pre>
I can estimate X=0.2m and S=1E-5 (maybe larger than you expected because we need to consider the <i>whole</i> feather as the spring, not just its stem (wrong term?). Under it&#x27;s own weight the feather seems to move approximately x=1E-2m so X&#x2F;x=20, F is of course half the weight. It&#x27;s hard to get good estimates on the internet for the weight of a feather. The most reliable estimates seem to be 8.2E-6kg for a chicken feather. Chicken feathers are small, let&#x27;s say 5E-2m so our feathers have a mass of 8.2E-6kg(X&#x2F;5E-2m)^3=0.5E-3kg. Half a gram for the giant feather. Doesn&#x27;t sound implausible.<p>Plugging all values in we get Y=5248Pa. Speed of sound is c=(Y&#x2F;)=c=(Y&#x2F;(M&#x2F;V))=(YSX&#x2F;M)=4.58m&#x2F;s, a very low value indeed and quite consistent with the slow motion video.<p>Just for kicks, the speed of sound in rubber 60m&#x2F;s. It shouldn&#x27;t surprise us at all that the speed in feathers is smaller than for rubber. Feathers are much weaker springs than usual rubber springs. (Note that if we had a spring made of rubber coils, the speed of sound in the spring would also be much smaller than the speed of sound in a rubber rod).<p>The approximations made above are all pretty wild, but the point I was trying to make is that waves travel quite slow in weak springs. The exact values don&#x27;t matter. Just get yourself a long spring made of plastic or thin metal wire and create some waves. You can <i>see</i> the propagations, they move very slowly.",2014-11-04 16:17:55

To me it looks like it could be the solution to a lot of problems. What is good about the web for applications is that it is write once run everywhere (because people do not expect a native look and feel) and also that it is zero install. What is bad about the web for applications it is that it is designed for content presentation and not applications. For mobile it has a number of things that limit it for performance. To get something to even approach decent performance I have to try to understand a complex and opaque machine called the browser. Compared to native app development this is a lot more difficult. The machine is working against me because its primary concern is document layout.<p>So it looks to me like a browser for applications in resource constrained environments (mobile). I see nothing wrong with this; We used to have innovations like this all the time but since the browser came along its been a bit of a tyranny of orthodoxy. Why not have a browser for documents and a browser for applications? I certainly don&#x27;t like web apps in my browser for content sites.

The American historian, Arthur Schlesinger Jr., made the same point in the essay that served as his epitaph when it was published in the New York Times on January 1, 2007, two months before he died. Under the heading, Follys Antidote, he prescribed strong doses of history as a cure for the delusions of omnipotence and omniscience, akin to those that persuaded the Bush Administration to stage a rerun in Iraq of Americas misadventure in Vietnam. The failure to connect the then with the now Schlesinger diagnosed as an illness which, if left untreated, he thought likely to lead to the death of the American idea. Children unfamiliar with the world in time make easy marks for the dealers in fascist politics and quack religion. ...<p>An acquaintance with history doesnt pay the rent or predict the outcome of next years election, but, as the season or occasion requires, it makes possible the revolt against what G.K.

When I see Hillary Clinton and Rudy Giuliani being bundled around the country in a flutter of media consultants fitting words into their mouths, I think of the makeup artists adjusting the ribbons in Emperor Neros hair before sending him into an amphitheater to sing with a choir of prostitutes.

230,"The article&#x27;s explanation is a bit simplified.  It sounds like his explanation is more akin to a body freedom flutter response where the aircraft&#x27;s short-period mode is coupled to the structural response.  What he observed is probably closer to a more classical flutter response with the wing&#x27;s bending and torsion coupled.  A gust hits the wing, which increases the load, this increases the bending deformation which can also induce torsion causing a twist in the wing.  At too high of a speed (the flutter speed), the response is unstable and can quickly become catastrophic.  At normal speeds, the oscillation will tend to die out as the restoring force of the structure and the damping from the structure, aerodynamic loads and controls causes the response to die out.  Interestingly, you can go past the first flutter speed of an aircraft with a properly designed control system (aeroservoelasticity) meaning you can get away with a lighter (read, more flexible) wing structure.",2015-11-15 16:56:17

So the cops circulated a vague description of an average-height, average-weight, typically-dressed Bostonian male as a suspect for a nonexistent crime.<p>The Internet Tough Guys aside, the author did make a mistake in answering police questions.  It should have gone something like this:<p><pre><code>  Cop: Hey my man.

  Cop: No.
  SL: Am I under arrest?
  Cop: Not yet.
  SL: Why am I being detained?
  Cop: We had someone matching your description just try to break into a womans house.

  SL: My name is Steve Locke.  I live at XXXXX, in Dedham.

Torque from the airstream opposes the restoring torque that keeps the bridge (or business card) level.

Tragically, however, I was born without brevity.<p>1) Brain.fm: The Brain&#x27;s Perspective<p>When a sound enters your ear, it&#x27;s converted from a pressure wave to an electrical impulse, which you can measure in the brain as a kind of spike on an EEG, or a cortical response. If the sound plays again, another spike occurs (although typically smaller). If a sound keeps being repeated in a fast and precise enough way, the cortical responses start to resemble rhythms already in the brain.<p>For example, if you tap your finger rapidly on the table, you might be tapping at 10hz (10 taps a second). 10hz is also a very dominant in the brain. If you could tap your finger precisely enough, and for a long enough time, what you would see in the brain (if you know what you&#x27;re doing) is new activity at 10hz. This is called the Frequency Following Response, and it&#x27;s well established. Check it out on pubmed, etc, if you&#x27;re interested.<p>Now if you keep tapping for even longer - and again, if you&#x27;re super precise about it - your existing brainwave patterns near that same frequency will start to align themselves towards the phase and frequency of your tapping.<p>BTW sorry about the delay in responding to you. Believe it or not, in between some meetings I was searching for a good article this whole time to show you. Here it is: <a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pnas.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;111&#x2F;41&#x2F;14935.full"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pnas.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;111&#x2F;41&#x2F;14935.full</a><p>This effect is called lots of things, including, confusingly, the frequency-following response by some in the private sector. It&#x27;s most often known by the public as brainwave entrainment, but that&#x27;s rarely in the literature. In the literature you see all kinds of words for it: neural entrainment, auditory driving, auditory entrainment, steady state responses of various types... The level of confusion over what to call this thing is only eclipsed by the number of names made up for methods to induce it - all referring to the same thing: rhythmic auditory stimuli. No, better not call it that, in this paper its gonna be sinusoidal amplitude modulation, click trains, acoustic iterance, isochronous auditory stimuli, temporal sound... So, it gets a bit crazy when you try to search for this stuff (so we&#x27;ll be adding even more to our bibliography&#x2F;research library soon. Let me know if you haven&#x27;t seen that yet).<p>For the sake of this post let&#x27;s just call it Entrainment.<p>Something that&#x27;s also being figured out is how to define when exactly Frequency Following ends and Entrainment begins. Some say it doesn&#x27;t matter, others say it&#x27;s when the phase lines up, or if the new rhythm persists even when the external stimuli is removed, as in the article I linked you to. There&#x27;s also ways to approximate the root source of a neural rhythm (external or internal), if you also feed the stimuli into the analysis at the same exact time.<p>Anyway, to sum it up, what we&#x27;re doing is creating a rhythmic stimuli that resembles frequencies already in your brain. We play that stimuli long and consistently enough to actually register a pretty solid response on an EEG.<p>Of course, it gets more complicated than that. This is the brain we&#x27;re talking about. The waveform of the audio modulations matters (brainwaves aren&#x27;t perfect sine waves, after all), the way the frequency is changed over time matters. When do you take a break from the stimulation? When do you tone it down, or turn it up? And how do you adapt to people on an individual level? How do you measure it? Audio processing can change dramatically in the brain depending on the content of the audio!<p>But at any rate, changing the brainwaves of a person like this can also change their mental state. I&#x27;m not saying it takes over the brain. It just.. nudges it a bit in the right direction.<p>So that&#x27;s the basic outline from that perspective. Hope it makes sense, of course if you have any questions don&#x27;t hesitate.<p>2) Brain.fm: The Music Perspective<p>From an audio&#x27;s point of view, we&#x27;re doing a number of things to subtly create that necessary rhythmic stimulus.<p>a) We&#x27;re modulating every piece of audio. It&#x27;s these modulations that create a rapid rhythmic stimulus. If you listen carefully to Brain.fm, you may hear a fluttering sound. It&#x27;s more obvious in some parts over others. We&#x27;re using filtering techniques to target some frequency bands over others (and by frequency here, I&#x27;m now talking about the frequencies of pitch, not brainwaves, where a cello would be low and a violin would be high in frequency). Doing this, we can single out instruments, modulate parts of a nature soundscape but not others, or disguise the modulations as vibrator, tremolo, or the natural vibrations of instruments, strings or the LFOs of electronic music..<p>b) We align everything else in the session to the brain-frequency we&#x27;re trying to hit, so there is no interference from a stray drum beat or a snapping twig. Not only is there no interference, but the entire audio &quot;scene&quot; is being actively used to guide your brain toward the goal state.<p>The 3D audio also factors into this a lot, because the mind pays attention to motion, and that helps elliminate habituation. But that&#x27;s another story.<p>Hope this helped explain it. Completely understand if you need clarification, or an entirely new answer hah!<p>:)<p>- Adam from Brain.fm",2016-02-23 02:41:07

265,"No it doesn&#x27;t scale 1:1 or any way else at least not in any specific manner.<p>The scaling depends on how much lift you generate, the lift is a question of speed and your the available lift surface the nominal lift produced is then divided by surface area to give you your wing loading.<p>Solar is pretty much the most inefficient way of powering virtually any aircraft because you needlessly increase the weight of the lifting surface and batteries weight considerably more than fuel and that weight is dead weight during the entire flight while a fueled aircraft becomes lighter.<p>That said the scaling between the volume and the &quot;surface area&quot; isn&#x27;t even in question here because you are going to be hitting a wall much quicker and that&#x27;s takeoff weight as mentioned before lift is a factor of the surface area that can provide lift and the speed of the aircraft (as well as air density and some other things but lets ignore it) the heavier the aircraft the more energy you need to actually get to takeoff speeds, and when you make your lift surface bigger you increase drag as well as weight.<p>The speed you can reach is going to be more or less limited because even a 100% efficiency solar powered engines are going to be limited to the max cell efficiency * cell surface area, the 2nd part of the equation is your wing surface and eventually there is a limit to how big your wings can be and still support themselves and most importantly not flutter.
When you take all that and more into account there is absolutely no fucking way that you&#x27;ll make an aircraft capable of lifting a 50,000lbs of crago, heck you won&#x27;t build a solar aircraft capable of lifting 50,000 lbs of anything including itself. To put that into perspective 50,000lbs is 1&#x2F;6th of the maximum structural load that a 747-8F (freighter) can carry, and about 1&#x2F;4th of the nominal cargo load.<p>To put it into even more perspective Solar Impulse weights 3000 lbs, it&#x27;s maximum takeoff weight is about 4000 lbs and it has a max speed of 80km&#x2F;h with a wing span greater than that of a 747.
To put it simply there is no freaking way to scale this up, there is a good reason why nature haven&#x27;t developed heavy flyers the heaviest bird capable of flight weights 35 lbs, the rule of thumb is that when you double the weight you need a 4th time as much wing area and spend 4 times more calories to achieve flight and while mechanical flight isn&#x27;t exactly the same it&#x27;s not that different - the amount of energy you can produce more or less limits how well you can fly because at the end if you stick 2 SRB&#x27;s to a cargo container you don&#x27;t even need wings.<p>P.S.
And that&#x27;s before we getting into finding a material light enough to be viable for solar flight while still being able to bare the load of 50,000 lbs without collapsing, but even if you&#x27;ll take perfect carbon nano tubes or any other super material you still won&#x27;t be getting off the ground.<p>If you want solar cargo air transport blimps are probably the way to go...",2016-04-24 13:41:31

I learned this technique in 1998 or 1999 from a Yale or Harvard swimmer home on vacation in Sierra Madre, CA. He was doing this crazy sideways kick thing, and when I asked him about he said his coach had them doing it because if you tried to do a pure kick version of the butterfly from a normal face-down position you lost too much range of motion in the small of your back. I already knew other coaches encouraged on-your-side flutter kick practice to get more comfortable swimming on your side (most of the drag you experience has to do with surface interactions, so rolling your body to get it farther from the surface helps with drag, just like submarines can commonly go faster than surface ships).

Flutter uses the Dart language, so there&#x27;s a Dart environment included in Fuchsia too [2].<p>For rendering, Fuchsia includes a project called Escher [3] which is described as a physically based renderer that supports soft shadows, light diffusion and other advanced effects. Looking at the source code, Escher is designed to use either OpenGL or Vulkan as the underlying graphics API. (There&#x27;s an iOS example project included in Escher&#x27;s source tree. Would be interesting to build that.)<p>It&#x27;s not immediately obvious why a lightweight operating system would need a renderer that can do realtime soft shadows and light effects...!

Shadows and subtle color reflections are a major part of that &quot;layered paper&quot; aesthetic.<p>So, the stack seems to be: Dart is the language for GUI apps, Flutter provides the widgets, and Escher renders the layers.<p>The underlying application framework is called Mojo [4]. It already offers bindings for Go, Java, JavaScript, Python and Rust in addition to Dart, but maybe those languages are meant for services rather than GUI apps.

Thenceforth she resumed using cocaine too.<p>In summer 2015, she used Methadone for her opiate addiction, heroin on the days that she didn&#x27;t make it to the methadone clinic before they closed, cocaine for her depression, and alcohol for her anxiety.<p>By August 2015, with my help, she came to appreciate that she &#x27;wished she wasn&#x27;t a drug addict.&#x27; The internet told me that the best way to quit opiates is cold-turkey, which is how she&#x27;d done it previously.<p>But she&#x27;d trained her brain to run on Acetate (the energy-rich breakdown products of ethanol), and became psychotic when the alcohol went away. This is a well-known complication of excessive alcohol use.

Even though they found cocaine in her bloodwork, they treated her with &#x27;anti-psychotics&#x27;. These drugs were originally known as sedatives, and do not in any way fix problems for the person they&#x27;re given to.<p>Even though they knew her psychosis was the result of substances, my friend got trapped with a court order to take whatever drugs her psychiatrists think are appropriate. Anti-psychotics (and benzodiazepines) are bad drugs that make people&#x27;s mental problems worse. She stabilizes while in their facilities because she&#x27;s mostly sober. They let her out, and she turns to her old friends provided by the street pharmacy to try to feel better, and before long has to go back to the mental hospital.<p>I can tell when she&#x27;s used cocaine (which she says doesn&#x27;t &#x27;work&#x27; anymore) - it takes a couple hours for her to mostly recover. Methamphetamine makes her psychotic for 3-4 days. In my opinion, stimulants provided by plants are much safer than synthetic amphetamines.<p>Last week I filed a petition with the court to ask them to investigate her court-ordered treatment, which I do not believe has complied with the requirements of the law.<p>I also contacted the local chapter of the ACLU (American Civil Liberties Union) to see if they can lend some assistance. We have the right to refuse medical treatment, unless a psychiatrist thinks you have a &#x27;persistent mental disorder&#x27;, then you have to take whatever psychotropic drugs the psychiatrist thinks you should take.<p>tl&#x2F;dr: The drug problem would be easy to turn into a manageable public health issue if not for modus operandi of the mental health industry, which thinks &quot;palliative care&quot; is the best they can offer.<p>(There&#x27;s a psychiatrist who comments on some of these HN stories. I think it&#x27;d be really easy to turn the field into an effective, helpful profession. But they&#x27;d have to acknowledge the psychotropic pharmacopeia is mostly defective, and start over from scratch. There is much resistance to progress.)",2016-08-26 15:54:36

My sense is that after the Chrome team decided not to include the Dart VM in Chrome, Dart started looking for a new story. That story is Flutter, which is Dart running in the Dart VM on mobile devices [1] It is not Dart converted to JavaScript so it can run in any browser, despite the awesome work of the dart2js authors and the relatively new dev_compiler project [2]. The latter will be awesome when done, because the goal is to convert Dart to ES6&#x2F;ES2015. However, it is my impression that Google really doesn&#x27;t care that much about transpiling Dart to JavaScript. I was willing to put up with the huge file size dart2js produced, because Dart made my life easier and something better was coming. However, it&#x27;s been a long time and the pace of Dart transpiling work is too slow. I converted my Dart app to TypeScript (size dropped from 650kb to 60 kb) and am happy for that, but sad that Google does not put more people on the dev_compiler team to keep long term enthusiasts like me on board. I&#x27;m sure Flutter is fantastic and will take a look when I have a need for that kind of solution. I can&#x27;t really blame Google, because the JavaScript community turned it&#x27;s back on Dart, but I wish they would just state the new goals and not leave us hanging.<p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;flutter.io&#x2F;faq&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;flutter.io&#x2F;faq&#x2F;</a>

Its obivious what google thinks how web and mobile apps can be done in the future and even doing it already internaly. tracking Dart from time to time I thought, that it &quot;somewhat died&quot; and never got traction... it still seems so, but seeing what google is doing is encouraging. Its clear that if google thinks that webapps have to be done the angular.dart way, they will do it for the next 8 years or so; if the rest of us thinks that JS thing is the thing, googles way might be the same.<p>For flutter it might be different if Android gets expanded with flutter.<p>I used GWT a few years ago and still have a GWT app in production (which I hope never has to change until decommission).<p>Its not a coincidence that the mentioned GWT app should get replaced with a complete rewrite and we are at the point where we lay out the options to do that. GWT is marked clearly as &quot;dead&quot; for new developments within the clients infrastructure. Angular an reactjs are the recommended frameworks, even node.js and plain JS is a &quot;allowed&quot; option.<p>I do not have preferences for any plain JS or not typesafe languages personaly; but with the history of GWT, Dart or Angular.dart is a hard sell in this situation. Taking the Dart way is similar as we took GWT a few years ago, but even more a lockin into something the rest of us isn&#x27;t doing (that does not mean the best is what others do, but you know what I mean eh?) because Dart is a new language and framework, from where one couldn&#x27;t get away easy. The same applies to GWT; that code gets not compiled without gwt tools after you opted into GWT.<p>I hope Dart is making its way to (perhaps) replace Java in Android or make it into an alternative to the default.<p>For Dart as a Language for the web I don&#x27;t know yet what happens(who knows). 2x productivity improvements for an App as mentioned in the summit talks is really great, and I think google doesn&#x27;t advertise that if not true.

300,"PS:  the nutshell on nuclear-thermal engines is that it allows you to finally break the &quot;tyranny of the rocket equation&quot;.<p>Right now the reason space travel sucks is staging.  To send a small ship to mars, you need a small rocket.  But you have to inject that small rocket into orbit with a medium rocket.  And you have to get that medium rocket out of the atmosphere with a large rocket.  At each stage, the only way you can gain forward speed is by throwing an equal mass backwards (not quite but works for a description).  So to throw a tiny mass where you want it, you need to throw a whole bunch of crap away first to push you.  The Saturn-V rocket was <i>more than 90% fuel by weight</i>.  Chemical rockets are literally just big gas tanks that you can drop part of when they&#x27;re empty so you don&#x27;t have to drag around dead weight, that&#x27;s it.<p>Working temperature is an extremely important factor for the specific impulse (thrust per mass of fuel consumed) a rocket generates.  The hotter the reaction mass, the more thrust you get out of it.  I&#x27;ll come back to this but the point is you need to heat the gas.<p>In chemical rockets the energy source and the reaction mass are integral, you burn the fuel and it uses its hot exhaust as a reaction mass.  The advantage of a nuclear-thermal engine is that they&#x27;re <i>separate</i> - with fission&#x2F;fusion you can heat an immense amount of reaction mass with a small amount of fuel, and <i>you can pick up more reaction mass as you go</i> (via ramscoop).  Suddenly the whole picture changes, because you no longer need to lift the skyscraper full of reaction mass that you don&#x27;t really care about in order to move the tiny spacecraft you do want.  As long as you&#x27;re going fast enough you can ramscoop yourself more from hydrogen that&#x27;s just floating around space at about 1 atom per cm^3.<p>Not only that but nuclear rockets get much hotter than chemical rockets and you could produce about twice the specific impulse, making your reaction mass go a lot farther.<p>Obviously the task of building orbital infrastructure is an immense one.  It&#x27;s a 50-year project, maybe a little less if we pipeline things to push it along.  There is a massive amount of R&amp;D that would have to happen, but almost all of the technology described here literally exists today.  There are no magic materials we need to invent, it&#x27;s just engineering the pieces together.  We have linear induction motors, we have externally-stabilized supertall structures (antenna towers), we have steam catapults, we have nuclear reactors.  We just need to turn them into a launch loop.  And you don&#x27;t even need all that launch capacity, it just makes things easier - Deep Space Industries wants to pull an asteroid in with just small probes, it&#x27;s just going to take a lot, lot longer.  NASA has tested nuclear rockets (NERVA program).  etc etc.  We would have some work to do on implementing a practical ramscoop, and we would need to figure out how to do mining, refining, and fabrication effectively, but those are relatively discrete tasks that are solvable with current technology, it&#x27;s just a matter of figuring out what works and what doesn&#x27;t.<p>Our children could live in an interplanetary (bordering on interstellar) society if we wanted them to, using shit we&#x27;ve got lying around right now.  Our children could walk on other planets and work in space.  They could live to see the first pictures beamed back from another solar system, and if not them then their children would.<p>Throughout history humans have looked up at the stars and wondered what was going on up there.  They watched the gods wander the sky, and made up tales of what they might be doing.  The truth is that we are a unique generation of human beings, because we are the first humans to ever live who have had the planets and the stars in their grasp and yet turned away.  The Greatest Generation didn&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s really only in the last 20-30 years that we have lost our way, but now it&#x27;s just perceived as normal.  Like the grandparent said - a mission to Mars is just some impossible fantasy that&#x27;s always 20 years away.  The truth is that it&#x27;s 20 years away because we never bothered to get started.  It&#x27;s the pile of dishes in our sink that we never wash, or the &quot;check engine&quot; light we always ignore.  It&#x27;s always easier to put it off until tomorrow. We&#x27;re just so busy with [crisis of the day], or the standoff with [enemy of the day], or if there&#x27;s no crisis then taxes need to be cut and there&#x27;s just no money left in the budget to spare.<p>I don&#x27;t particularly care that the moon landings were done out of a sense of nationalistic dick-waving.  We don&#x27;t refuse to drive on the interstates just because they were <i>built</i> so the military could move troops around during World War 3.  We don&#x27;t refuse to use the Internet just because it was <i>designed</i> as a military command-and-control system.  We don&#x27;t refuse to use computers because they were <i>designed</i> to break military codes and simulate the wing flutter of bomber aircraft and the explosions of nuclear warheads.  The history of technological advancement is literally bathed in blood.  I don&#x27;t know for sure but I imagine the first tool humanity ever invented was used to bash someone&#x27;s head in.  The fact that we can reflect on that is the self-awareness we need to come together and make this push for our species&#x27; future.",2016-12-02 22:33:04

304,"I&#x27;ve looked into Dart a few times and thought it looked interesting, but never really dug much into it. I&#x27;ve also really only heard of it being used in Google. Oh, and I remember hearing Notch was using it in a game jam a few years back.<p>I saw Flutter when it was first announced, and something that caught my eye back then was that it looked like it took some inspiration from React. I&#x27;m a big fan of React. Their home page [0] says: &quot;Note: Flutter is an early-stage open-source project. We hope you try Flutter out and send us feedback.&quot; Would you say it&#x27;s ready for production?<p>Could you provide other examples of use-cases for which you&#x27;d use Dart? Does it have good editor integration for autocompletion and linting? Is debugging painful? One of my favorite things about JS is Chrome Dev Tools.<p>I don&#x27;t mean for this to come off as rude or negative, but I&#x27;d be interested in hearing a bit about where you consider the language or ecosystem falls short. I find discussing the downsides, limitations, and problems helps in understanding the tool and setting expectations. Nobody expects a magic wand solution, of course.<p>One of my pain points from working with a large SPA is architecting the application so it&#x27;s easy to lazily views as needed. By itself it&#x27;s not very difficult, but getting the whole build &#x2F; development &#x2F; test  environment workflows setup is more challenging to get right. Does Dart have good tooling for generating builds? I use Webpack with the large JS SPA I work on, and one of its killer feature is that it&#x27;ll crawl the dependency graph, copying assets to the output folder, and updating references. Unfortunately, the default behavior makes it most easy to generate a single large JS bundle.<p>[0] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;flutter.io&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;flutter.io&#x2F;</a>",2017-01-11 01:27:54

345,"Definitely interested in seeing how Flutter progresses, IMO it has the optimal architecture for developing native, x-plat iOS&#x2F;Android UI (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;flutter.io&#x2F;technical-overview&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;flutter.io&#x2F;technical-overview&#x2F;</a>):<p><pre><code>   - High perf Skia based UI for pixel perfect rendering and high-level Material design widgets
   - React inspired, productive development model
   - Fast dev&#x2F;iteration cycles with hot reloading
   - Productive and high-performance Dart language, natively compiled (AOT on iOS)
   - Enable native interop with underlying iOS&#x2F;Android APIs
   - Actively developed by Google
</code></pre>
Overall I think it has a superior architecture to React Native where it will enable higher-perf native iOS&#x2F;Android Apps in a single code-base but still enables a productive development model with Instant UI updates and hot reloading. I&#x27;ve done Java and Kotlin Android Apps as well as Obj-C and Swift iOS Apps but I find React Native&#x27;s dev model a lot more productive.<p>Unfortunately I&#x27;ve run into a few issues with React Native that I&#x27;ve had to workaround which I&#x27;ve submitted repros to months ago but received no response from the React Native team except in the last couple of days where they&#x27;ve closed it without even looking at it because it didn&#x27;t receive comments&#x2F;activity from other devs. In the last 2 days React Native has closed 773 other issues because they consider it low priority:<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;facebook&#x2F;react-native&#x2F;issues?q=label%3AIcebox+is%3Aclosed"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;facebook&#x2F;react-native&#x2F;issues?q=label%3AIc...</a><p>This gives me low confidence that React Native will be a high quality platform with current low-priority issues lingering indefinitely so I welcome competition from Google with Flutter and will be anxiously looking forward to trying it out when it gets out of alpha.",2017-05-28 06:04:30
346,"I also played with Flutter recently. Timeline: heard Kotlin announcement at I&#x2F;O, went through some Kotlin exercises, wanted to compare with Flutter&#x2F;Dart.<p>Dart feels somewhere in between JavaScript on the one hand and a more-static OO, GC&#x27;d lang w&#x2F;type inference (like Kotlin!) on the other. You can probably look closely at some sample app code and start doing some basic stuff quickly if you&#x27;ve worked much with JS and something more static. (Further study seems worth it if you plan to do a lot, heh!)<p>As others note the UI model seems Reacty--you write &quot;builder&quot; methods that recreate a widget tree when things change, and something behind the scenes sorts out an efficient way to update the screen with just what really changed. I&#x27;m not <i>hugely</i> worried about performance: your UI rebuilds should be separated from your animations, and anyway, building your virtual widget hierarchy ideally shouldn&#x27;t be too CPU intensive in the first place.<p>Hot reload is pretty great. I can&#x27;t actually compare with &quot;real Android&quot; dev, but changes to my little app showed up in under a second in an Android phone, emulated or real. There were a couple surprising things about the basic libs, e.g. Flutter master only recently added a convenience object to bundle together a radio&#x2F;checkbox and its associated label-stuff (RadioListTile).<p>The Flutter Gallery app is available on Google Play and its source is in the Flutter git tree. You can see a lot of the Material widgets implemented, including rich list types (e.g. tiles w&#x2F;photos), pull-from-the-side drawers, top-of-screen tabs you can swipe through, bottom-of-the-screen nav bars etc. Even on iOS Google seems to follow Material guidelines a lot (or at least, the Daring Fireball guy complained that they do; I don&#x27;t have iOS to check), so maybe it&#x27;s the easiest fit if you&#x27;re prepared to do the same. Someone who works on Flutter mentioned elsewhere in these comments that they&#x27;re working on components that look more like the iOS-native ones, though.<p>Although Android Studio is _based on_ IntelliJ, you need to get actual IntelliJ if you want to use the plugin (Studio&#x27;s component versions don&#x27;t match the ones that the Flutter plugin works with, I think). Also, if you have Studio 3.0 canary installed (like to futz w&#x2F;Kotlin, heh!), you need to either configure Flutter to look for the stable Studio 2.3&#x27;s copy of Gradle (flutter config --gradle-dir=...) or just make sure 2.3 is located where the flutter tools look by default (~&#x2F;android-studio for me on Linux). People working on Flutter helped some of us through this at <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;flutter&#x2F;flutter&#x2F;issues&#x2F;10236#issuecomment-303029027"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;flutter&#x2F;flutter&#x2F;issues&#x2F;10236#issuecomment...</a><p>You get a lot of IDE-ish luxuries (as OP notes): Control-Space to offer identifiers, methods, or params available; autoformatting with dartfmt (right-click menu); lots of quick feedback when you mess something up.<p>Hixie (Ian Hickson) of the HTML5 spec works on Flutter which is kinda neat (he did RadioListTile just now! and there&#x27;s a milestone on GitHub named &#x27;Make Hixie Proud&#x27; haha :D). Outside of the tech specifics, Dart&#x27;s an interesting creature in that it seems like it&#x27;s got some key customers in Google (AdWords, so, like, the part that makes money) but comparatively little pickup outside. On Flutter GitHub you see people paying attention to outside-adopter issues (or even passerby issues such as my Gradle-version thing recently).

354,"I always liked wxWidgets for that, and other people MFC, but where wxWidgets failed for me was a simple text area editor, which underneath was sending messages to the Windows Control, and in order to retrieve the current line, it had to scan through the whole text buffer over and over... &quot;Leaky abstraction&quot;...<p>I also was &quot;worried&quot; (more than need to) - how people with disabilities, or special devices (non-standard pointer devices, like artists) would use Qt, as I thought there is no native support.<p>And yet, I was mistaken. Windows (and other systems) expose an &quot;assistive&quot; layer where you can explain to the underlying windowing system what is each thing that you draw, the text, etc. And Qt solved it.<p>Once we moved from MFC -&gt; Qt, and removed other uses of wxWidgets, non-ui programmers started adding bits and pieces much easier in Qt (I&#x27;m not claiming Qt superiority), because all it took sometimes was to subclass, and repaint something, add button or two and create new control. With MFC that was hard, and with wxWidgets kind of tricky (solutions always ended up being &quot;Windows&quot; specific, not that we cared about Linux&#x2F;OSX back then).<p>So that&#x27;s why I love flutter, and it reminds of Unreal&#x27;s internal UI used by it&#x27;s editor.<p>At work I&#x27;m still struggling with GWT, XML ui binder files, and trying to componentize modules.

371,"My first problem with Flutter is that it doesn&#x27;t unify web and native development, so it fails to solve the big problem immediately. If you can deliver web and mobile from the same codebase, you can deal with the &quot;long tail&quot; of users (and web users too). React Native (not that I have any great love of React) and its clones are working towards supporting all platforms.<p>My second problem with Flutter is the writer&#x27;s apparent biggest positive feature  Dart. (I love how he naively states that Dart was conceived as a language to transpile to Javascript; it was conceived as a <i>replacement</i> for Javascript with transpilation as a stopgap.) I think Javascript is a fine (&quot;good enough&quot;) language that (a) works almost everywhere and (b) is evolving at a more-than-sufficient rate. I have no desire to drink Google&#x27;s Kool-aid. (Go, OTOH, I am fine with.)<p>But then I get to &quot;Building Layouts with Flutter&quot;:<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;flutter.io&#x2F;tutorials&#x2F;layout&#x2F;#step-1"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;flutter.io&#x2F;tutorials&#x2F;layout&#x2F;#step-1</a><p>This makes the articles I&#x27;ve read on &quot;thinking the React way&quot; seem mild in comparison. In exchange for having to restrict your layout ideas to the stuff that will work in Flutter (which first entails somehow grokking what works in Flutter), you have to go from visual concept to hierarchical breakdown and then translate that into code in less than intuitive ways, and then when your graphic designer decides that such-and-such needs to be 2 pixels lower or the stars should get bigger in the middle, you&#x27;re still going to be hosed or inserting fixed height shims all over the place (and how will that look on a tablet?)<p>This API seems too high level to produce polished products. Of course it&#x27;s alpha so blah blah blah but being able to quickly produce generic stuff is not a proof of concept, especially if you can&#x27;t then refine the generic stuff to the nth degree.",2017-06-23 16:48:31

374,"&gt; A static language can have an &quot;only known at runtime&quot; type that lets you do the same thing as the default in a dynamic language, when it is needed.<p>In almost all cases runtime &quot;holes&quot; in static type languages provides a sub par development experience that&#x27;s worse than both dynamic and static typing, it&#x27;s definitely not a strategy for developing the same class of software on and it&#x27;s not comparable to using a first class dynamically typed language. The places where it works is in static type systems are used to annotate a dynamic runtime like TypeScript, Hack and (less so) Dart.<p>&gt; All I&#x27;m &quot;throwing shade on&quot; is the idea that users don&#x27;t care about quality, and that static languages have no inherent quality advantages over dynamic languages. I disagree with either idea.<p>Suggesting dynamic languages are &quot;slow, unstable, drains your battery, is constantly offline, or has major security flaws&quot; is throwing shade with no basis in reality.<p>&gt; why can&#x27;t that model be used in other statically-typed languages? I think it&#x27;s only a matter of time, personally.<p>It doesn&#x27;t exist because it&#x27;s simpler, requires significantly less effort and is more naturally suitable to implement in a dynamic language. In these classes of software choosing a static language is the wrong choice that will always yield inferior results due to their lack of dynamic capabilities and interested resources who naturally gravitate around dynamic language ecosystem. No doubt many devs will still try using their preferred static language but they will all fail to achieve anywhere near the level of success, featureset and penetration of equivalent dynamic language implementations.<p>Of course as it&#x27;s software, given enough resources anything is possible, like Apple is able to do with Swift Playgrounds but they&#x27;re in the unique position of being able to change Swift&#x27;s language and runtime to introduce the capabilities needed to make Swift Playgrounds feasible - which is major strategic project for Apple which I still hold would require significantly less effort using a dynamic language. Google has the same benefits with what they&#x27;re able to do with Dart where their flutter project offers a compelling live programming experience for developing native mobile Apps. Both would be considerably harder if they weren&#x27;t able to change the language and runtime to make it easier for them, e.g. snapshots would be nigh impossible without language&#x2F;runtime support.<p>Likewise their exists classes of performance and mission critical software that&#x27;s not suitable for dynamic languages, but it&#x27;s not always a mistake to start with a dynamic language first to prototype quickly then rewrite once the system requirements have been identified and solidified.",2017-07-01 22:08:17

The app runs using the native instruction set (no interpreter is involved).<p>Does Flutter use my systems OEM widgets?<p>No. Instead, Flutter provides a set of widgets (including Material Design and Cupertino (iOS-styled) widgets), managed and rendered by Flutters framework and engine. You can browse a catalog of Flutters widgets.<p>We are hoping the end-result will be higher quality apps. If we reused the OEM widgets, the quality and performance of Flutter apps would be limited by the quality of those widgets.<p>In Android, for example, theres a hard-coded set of gestures and fixed rules for disambiguating them. In Flutter, you can write your own gesture recognizer that is a first-class participant in the gesture system. Moreover, two widgets authored by different people can coordinate to disambiguate gestures.<p>Modern app design trends point towards designers and users wanting more motion-rich UIs and brand-first designs. In order to achieve that level of customized, beautiful design, Flutter is architectured to drive pixels instead of the OEM widgets.<p>By using the same renderer, framework, and set of widgets, we make it easier to publish for both iOS and Android concurrently, without having to do careful and costly planning to align two separate codebases and feature sets.<p>By using a single language, a single framework, and a single set of libraries for all of your UI (regardless if your UI is different for each mobile platform or largely consistent), we also aim to help lower app development and maintenance costs.<p>What happens when my mobile OS updates and introduces new widgets?<p>The Flutter team watches the adoption and demand for new mobile widgets from iOS and Android, and aims to work with the community to build support for new widgets. This work may come in the form of lower-level framework features, new composable widgets, or new widget implementations.<p>Flutters layered architecture is designed to support numerous widget libraries, and we encourage and support the community in building and maintaining widget libraries.<p>What happens when my mobile OS updates and introduces new platform capabilities?<p>Flutters interop and plugin system is designed to allow developers to access new mobile OS features and capabilities immediately.

432,"This is really exciting  as someone who spends far too much time messing around making electronic music, I was thinking about how cool it would be to have a voice-to-instrument converter. After all, if a computer can create the sounds of an orchestra or band with just your vocal beatboxing &#x2F; humming chops and a sprinkle of machine learning, then that&#x27;s all you need to make the next hit-song, right?<p>Well  not trying to detract too much from this field  but, that&#x27;s where I think the expectations of grandeur, that some people will get about this emerging technology, are kinda wrong. There are a few issues I can think of that will need to be overcome (if even possible?) before this technology can be considered groundbreaking.<p>From the &#x27;person&#x27; side:
(1) - Vocal range and ability &gt;&gt; This one is going to be most hard as most people can only sing within a couple of octaves, and even then, need quite a bit of &#x27;tuning&#x27; help to identify the right notes &#x2F; intentions. 
(2) Musical theory &gt;&gt; Fitting into the above, if you don&#x27;t have any musical theory knowledge (about what key you&#x27;re supposed to be in, or about chords, or progression), then a machine learning process would have to fill-in all the chords and textures &#x2F; build-up. But that really can only help you so much, unless you&#x27;re just interested in the &#x27;novelty&#x27; aspect of it.<p>From the &#x27;machine&#x27; side:
(3) &#x27;Bum&#x27; notes and &#x27;quantisation&#x27; &gt;&gt; I noticed from the samples that the saxophone would produce flutter around a note, and also the timings weren&#x27;t &#x27;on the beat&#x27;  but this should be quite trivial. 
(4) Expressiveness &gt;&gt; Right now, the instruments might be adjusting to the input velocities (loudness), but if you want a life-like sax sound then you&#x27;ll need to produce a level of expressiveness that makes it sound realistic... This can be achieved with a mixture of better (available) virtual instrumentation, and also ML to figure out what the best intentions are of the input<p>I think the two big key factors are musical theory and expressiveness. With the former, I think anyone who has a good enough understanding of musical theory probably wouldn&#x27;t have much of a use for this other than a novelty until it produces compelling, effortless results. This is because they&#x27;re most likely to have some kind of instrumental knowledge (keyboard most specifically for virtual instruments) and music composition experience. The two groups this kind of tech would really help are a) very good vocalists who have no electronic composition experience but a good grasp of music theory  Michael Jackson is a good example of this as this is how he made his song ideas[0], and b) music producers &#x2F; instrumentalists that want to &#x27;fill-in&#x27; a lot of parts quickly by humming &#x2F; beatboxing  but again, they can probably do this with a keyboard reasonably effortlessly. If the &#x27;expression&#x27; is worked on a lot, then it will become more interesting as expressive effects are hard to get right without expensive hardware.

433,"I know some people simply need spontaneity to be creative, but I think most people are fine being creative on a schedule. One of the most powerful quotes from Stephen King&#x27;s book &quot;On Writing&quot;:<p>&quot;There is a muse, but hes not going to come fluttering down into your writing room and scatter creative fairy-dust all over your typewriter or computer. He lives in the ground. Hes a basement kind of guy. You have to descend to his level, and once you get down there you have to furnish an apartment for him to live in. You have to do all the grunt labor, in other words, while the muse sits and smokes cigars and admires his bowling trophies and pretends to ignore you. Do you think its fair? I think its fair. He may not be much to look at, that muse-guy, and he may not be much of a conversationalist, but hes got inspiration. Its right that you should do all the work and burn all the mid-night oil, because the guy with the cigar and the little wings has got a bag of magic. Theres stuff in there that can change your life. Believe me, I know.&quot;<p>I think most on Hacker News would agree with this sentiment. If you aren&#x27;t putting in the work how can you expect the muse to give you inspiration? You must lay the framework of creativity in your mind in order for it to strike. It is like the medium of an agar plate you use to grow critters in a lab, only in your mind you must create this medium by hard work and laying the framework. Sure inspiration strikes at times with or without this work, but (for me) it reliably strikes when I put in the work.<p>GTD is almost meta to this. It is just a system to keep your plate free to do your important work and prioritize your important work. It eliminates the mental clutter so you can focus on what is important. Many other productivity and self help systems all go down that same path. But it doesn&#x27;t get at the core discipline of being regular and scheduled that is almost a requirement as a professional.",2017-11-21 18:52:40

&gt; Our phytomass harvests go beyond the metabolic needs to secure raw materials (wood, fibers, pulp) and energy (fuelwood, charcoal, straw) whose inputs remain indispensable even in the age of metals, concrete, synthetics, and fossil fuels. The biosphere has paid a considerable price for these human gains as both its total stock of standing phytomass and its overall productivity have declined by significant margins. And because we are an omnivorous species we have also been harvesting a wide variety of zoomass by collecting and hunting animals as foragers and eventually also deliberately raising them as pastoralists and farmers. These actions have reduced the stocks of wild terrestrial and marine animals while massively expanding the stocks of cattle, water buffaloes, horses, camels, sheep, pigs, and poultry.<p>&quot;Harvesting the Biosphere: The Human Impact&quot; ~ Vaclav Smil <a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vaclavsmil.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;PDR37-4.Smil_.pgs613-636.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vaclavsmil.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;PDR37-4.Smil_.p...</a>",2018-01-13 05:27:15

There are packages for redux as well in flutter, so state management is taken care of [2].

As mobile devices get bigger - big phones, tablets, pixel thingies or whatever - it&#x27;d be nice to port existing software to them.

Is that sound due to a) their process of re-organizing the grains, b) the quality of the original recording, c) the envelopes they used, or d) something else entirely?<p>If instead one uses grains which begin and end at zero, the answer can&#x27;t be C because it doesn&#x27;t exist. I can say that the quality sounds fine in the few examples I&#x27;ve heard that use this technique.<p>I&#x27;d imagine the reason the latter isn&#x27;t used as often is because it&#x27;s simply more difficult to program if each grain can be an arbitrary size (or at least not quantized).",2018-03-07 17:38:49

But the specifics are different enough such that it&#x27;s hard to do both to a high level. Or perhaps I&#x27;m just speaking for my own limitations -- I do iOS &amp; Android (native &amp; a bit of react native), but I&#x27;m definitely less of an expert with either (or the various server things I also do) than I would be if I specialised.<p>Yeah, that&#x27;s definitely true pretty much why projects like react native and flutter exist.

AWS can be come so complex so fast, especially when they have many ways to do the same thing (often built upon each other) and it isn&#x27;t necessarily immediately clear which is the best for your usecase. The additional management they give you for some services is minimal -- I&#x27;m thoroaughly convinced that most of the &quot;value&quot; offered by RDS is more-or-less thanks to tools like postgres being well-written&#x2F;robust software.<p>I agree on the language being relatively trivial too -- maybe the importance of platforms ties into that -- Once the language difference becomes trivial the next big differentiator must indeed be platforms&#x2F;the well-used structures that are built on the base language.

Push a view onto the navigation stack, let it collect input from the user, pop off the stack with a data structure representing the user input)<p>* Animations are easy<p>* Minimal opening of Xcode.

The only winglike thing that messes with the viscous boundary layer is a VG. Second, winglets have nothing to do with a &quot;mixing boundary;&quot; They do what they do, even in completely inviscid flow, where there is no boundary layer. Third, whether an air mass has to &quot;accelerate&quot; has nothing to do with efficiency. For example, air is adiabatically compressed as it meets the stagnation point on a wing, or en masse as it enters a subsonic diffuser (jet intake). The former is a consequence of fluid flow in general, and the latter is by design. Both are completely isentropic and lead to no total pressure losses in the flow.<p>Finally, it&#x27;s meaningless to say that wings &quot;can be designed to have...arbitrary amounts of lift,&quot; and plainly incorrect to say that drag is the &quot;secret sauce.&quot; (Aeroelastic flutter? Wing mass? Control moments? Moment coefficients?) Reducing induced drag is done in exactly two ways. You either increase the span or put a winglet on so you can <i>effectively</i> increase the span while still being able to park the plane.<p>Nobody thinks they can do brain surgery, but everybody is a fluid dynamicist.",2018-05-22 14:43:29

582,"So dart has the concept of gradual typing, where some portion of the program is annotated and the rest is not. I&#x27;m not completely up to date on current dart, but for some time there was the concept of checked compilation sms unchecked. Now I think it&#x27;s called strong mode.<p>Anyways, you could check for certain major structural errors in unchecked mode and compile very fast, and then when it&#x27;s time to start propping up a release, you can turn on checked mode and catch more intricate errors.<p>Gilad has been working on gradual&#x2F;optional type systems for years. (they are technically two different ideas but the difference is rather academic and of little use to most programmers)<p>Anyways, dart has strong generics, it can do contravariance easily which makes refactoring code without breaking existing call sites, the dart lang spec has a great section on this.<p>In addition to all this, dart has really good reflection support through mirrors, a concept I&#x27;m not very familiar with, but it makes possible a tool called observatory, which is awesome. You can have source maps for dart2js, you can see which individual classes or methods or even lines of code are being utilized, you can get a lot visualizations about your performance profile, you can look at dart from the inside of dart. It&#x27;s a lot like smalltalk, but way more practical.<p>Sort of like how rails took a perfectly good language and destroyed it, flutter seems to have built a foundation for taking dart and exploiting it.<p>Now they say its  client-oriented&quot; which I assume is googlese for &quot;if you&#x27;re not using dart for flutter, fuck off.&quot;<p>There was also a dart llvm effort at one point, but that became too useful and was abandoned.<p>If you are looking for a really good functional language for web, consider F# if you have dotnet experience, or bucklescript if you have ocaml support, scalajs if you have jvm experience and also love shitty tooling, and finally, purescript if you like haskell.<p>HN likes Elm a lot, but it&#x27;s a little too opinionated for me, and although I like the BDFL approach to FOSS, it doesn&#x27;t mean that you should be the ONLY developer in the core.

587,"I tried both Flutter and ReactNative. I am not an expert, so take it with a grain of salt, but here is my first impression:<p>I would say the best part about it is the hot reload, which maintains application state. It&#x27;s compiled to native code so it&#x27;s going to run faster than ReactNative which is a javascript bundle that runs besides your app. Compile times are fast, but not instantaneous and you have to trigger the reload manually.<p>I think it also has the most complete implementation of Material UI out there. It implements widgets that are not implemented in iOS, Android nor Web. It&#x27;s like having something like bootstrap that makes it easier to build a good looking app. I feel like you really need a mock first to build a reactnative app, but you could get away with just writing code in flutter.<p>Unlike ReactNative there is no way of trying it without installing the Android or iOS development environment. Initially that was a bit of a barrier for me as a first-time mobile dev, but not a big deal eventually.<p>It&#x27;s not as mature as ReactNative. There was no build-in way to do audio, something I need for the app I am trying to build. However, I found a plugin for it on github.<p>I know Google has a reputation of canceling projects, but Flutter is used to develop the Google AdWords app so I don&#x27;t think it will go away anytime soon.",2018-06-03 05:03:32

This is the hardest in terms of learning curve, Swift concepts often do not translate to android, so it&#x27;s like two steep climbs.<p>- &quot;near-native&quot; is using some library&#x2F;tool that compiles down to JVM bytecode&#x2F;native code but usually implies bringing in new&#x2F;alternative tooling (integration levels vary) that holds the promise of having less warts. This is where tools like React Native[0], Vue Native[1], NativeScript[2] fit in (I&#x27;ll explain how later).<p>- &quot;webview&quot; is when you just make a mobile-friendly webpage and embed it inside an app by simply displaying it fullscreen. Android&#x2F;iOS also has features these days where you can pin webpages that act like mobile apps to screens, and IIRC android &quot;instant&quot; apps are the same concept. These have been criticized heavily for performance&#x2F;platform integration issues. This is where tools like Cordova[3] and Ionic[4] fit in.<p>SIDENOTE: FirefoxOS (RIP) was a mobile OS that took this to the extreme, having everything just be a webview and investing in the browser ecosystem heavily.<p>- In terms of difficulty&#x2F;ramp-up-time&#x2F;vendor-lockin, webview &lt; near-native &lt; native -- assuming that you know web tech already, and that the near-native toolchain is indeed easier.<p>- While React[7] started by targeting the web exclusively (though I think it might have always been a goal to branch out), they built in enough generalization to support react-native, whose feature is that it moved the boundaries a bit -- it works using native platform code to run a JS processing thread, and offers interop to native features directly. So it&#x27;s not a webview, and not completely native, it belongs in the near-native camp but it uses concepts that allows you to treat it almost like a webview app.<p>- The existence of React Native is a huge difference-maker for react. If you want to sell your team on react, the ability for a frontend developer to easily handle mobile application development is a strong selling point.<p>- Since react native&#x27;s near-native mechanism is well known, other projects have started to incorporate it -- Angular[5] proponents (and actually any js app in general) can use NativeScript[2] and Vue[6] proponents has been working on Vue Native[1] for a while.<p>- React Native, Vue Native, NativeScript are all attempts to bring the render-in-a-thread, shim-to-native-code-where-possible paradigm to different frontend frameworks that have existed.<p>- There are differences between Angular, React, and Vue that make it difficult for one project to interface with all of them (theoretically NativeScript could do it, as it supports any old JS app), and those differences are often opportunities for tight integration and developer ergonomics&#x2F;features.<p>- In the end, all this is meant to enable native-feeling application development with minimal vendor&#x2F;SDK lock-in and difficulty.<p>- There are other interesting approaches in the near-native space like <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;flutter.io&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;flutter.io&#x2F;</a> (almost like web view except natively by drawing every pixel on the screen) and <a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lambdanative.org&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lambdanative.org&#x2F;</a> (take a small lisp runtime with you)<p>[EDIT] - As pointed out in the subcomments on this post, React Native does not &#x27;compile down&#x27; to native code -- that is true.

629,"I wouldnt pick flutter since its so new and youre wanting to get to production. I assume you will end up having to spend a lot of time figuring out how to do simple things. You also wont have the benefit of community established best practices to save you from making costly mistakes.<p>To choose between native and react-native, list the functionality that your app will have, and see if react-native has good support for it. If it doesnt, you will have to write native code for both platforms and add it yourself.<p>This adds a ton of learning to the equation and makes the choice less clear, since now you have to learn react-native, plus some swift and Java. If more than a small part of your app ends up requiring to write native code, you might be better off making the whole apps in Swift and Java.<p>React native is very efficient for apps that show simple widgets like images, texts, lists, buttons, etc. You also have good support for playing video (I assume youll need it since you mention coursera-like content).<p>Some advice if you pick that route:
- Dont be fooled by its simplicity. You can make an app in hours, but if its non trivial you will require more time to really polish it
- React code can get messy fast, its easy to lose track of where state changes happen. Choosing a well known architecture and sticking with it (ex: redux) is super helpful as complexity grows
- to get to 60fps, you need to be very precise on how and when to make state&#x2F;U.I updates, so the optimization phase can take a while. I often end up going through all components in a tree to manually disable un-necessary re-renders, or delay re-rendering after some animation has completed.
- dont use react-router, its not suited for native needs (it keeps all previous views from the stack active which creates all sorts of problems)<p>Compared to learning two languages for making an iOS and Android app, react native is incredibly fast and efficient, especially when you come from the web.

656,"From what I&#x27;ve seen how apple did it:<p>1. They added optional nullability syntax to objective-c, a language that assumes everything is null and doesn&#x27;t crash when you send a message to nil.  If your file uses nullability, it&#x27;s required for the file, otherwise you don&#x27;t have to use it.  Code without nullability annotations using non-null annotated code could interface with the non-nullable code.  Errors didn&#x27;t come up unless you did very obvious things like directly put nil in a non-null argument.<p>2. They migrated their entire apple library base to have proper nullability annotations.  Code that didn&#x27;t have nullability annotations continued to work fine.  Or I think you could just turn off the build error with a compiler flag.<p>3. Apple introduced swift.  Any objective-c code that didn&#x27;t have nullability defined was assumed to be an implicitly unwrapped non-null.  So if you give a null to something not expecting a nil in swift, it would crash.<p>Apple has a blog article specifying it further here: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.apple.com&#x2F;swift&#x2F;blog&#x2F;?id=25"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.apple.com&#x2F;swift&#x2F;blog&#x2F;?id=25</a><p>-----<p>I liked this approach for the most part.  Migration wasn&#x27;t that much of a pain, and it was incentivized because I didn&#x27;t want implictly unwrapped stuff in my swift code.<p>If you migrated the flutter framework and the dart stdlib to have nullability, then new projects can start with proper nullability annotations from the start, while old projects can progressively migrate files as needed.<p>Java also has a nullable syntax annotation, and kotlin probably has some sort of java-kotlin nullability interop somewhere.  I would really suggest doing it, nullability has given big stability benefits to large projects as it is, and would help adoption in the future as people using something like kotlin &amp; swift for new projects vs flutter itself.",2018-06-21 00:02:39

It aimed to provide an electron compatible API over the native browser controls, which is definitely ideal but not so much for those who just want to write for Chrome and nothing else.<p>I think native app development might have a fair chance if it could adapt to some of the decisions the web dev community (and communities using server-side languages) have made over the years.<p>- There was a fairly universal rejection of WYSIWYG editors after the Frontpage&#x2F;Dreamweaver era, once CSS2 and XHTML started to become a thing; yet your default option for building a Mac or Windows app is to download around 6GB worth of IDE, interface builders, and other toolkits you&#x27;ll never even know you&#x27;ll need before you can properly get started.<p>- While you might consider a webpack or babel setup to have appropriated the position, you don&#x27;t require the solution or project file those editors build to get a hello world up and running by hand. An index.html and an app.js is enough to deploy an entire application.<p>- hot code reloading and debugging in the UI is a breeze (react native and flutter have been great for this too); no need to manually rebuild on each change.<p>This comes at the cost of dealing with the usual web-dev bugbears, ones that don&#x27;t exist when you&#x27;re working in C# or Obj-C or Swift or whatever, but the browser has almost accidentally become this amazing environment for experimental app development, that I imagine in some ways takes what Smalltalk had to offer in a totally different direction.<p>It would be interesting to see what OS vendors could do to level the playing field there.

But you could say the same about gtk, qt, etc. Or flutter. And yes, you would have to import the libs and some libs are not small, right? But this is also a problem that we face nowadays already, where the stack in a typical &quot;modern&quot; website requires the download of css and js frameworks that often weigh more than one megabyte of code.
Maybe once wasm is popular enough, the web browser will start shipping common stuff like libc when you install it? And then it would start resembling an OS instead of a VM.
I don&#x27;t know if I like this idea, but it seems to be the direction we&#x27;re heading to. We started with the browser being a system to access documents that can link to each other, and at some point a scripting language was introduced. Over time, it started being used as a application distribution plataform. Then people realized that maybe bending the scripting language to achieve that was becoming too much, and wasm was born. Now the browser is  a VM. Soon we&#x27;ll find out that we don&#x27;t need a VM, but a distributed OS instead.

693,"[Throw-away for obvious reasons; on HN since 2012; 25 years old]
I&#x27;m one of you who hangs out on HN&#x2F;PH&#x2F;Reddit. I joined CS in 2011, then dropped out to start freelancing (because I couldn&#x27;t pay college fees) in 2013. After three years, in late 2016 I quit freelancing, and since then I&#x27;ve been building utility apps and simple mobile games for the last two years. Some of my apps are bringing me Ad revenue; combined revenue from my projects might sustain me for a couple of years.<p>By working in dozens of small-scale projects, I have gained a diverse range of skills; I&#x27;m pretty good at Unity3D, image manipulation using C++, native mobile apps, system&#x2F;server administration (setting up web&#x2F;mail&#x2F;database servers and containers). Since I have had a passive revenue stream, I find myself spending a lot less time working; I just spend most of my time reading articles on Medium&#x2F;HN&#x2F;PH and tinkering with new technology, without any motive of commitment with any of those (take blockchain and flutter as two examples).<p>My apps might support me for 9-12 months without actively maintaining them. Personally I&#x27;d like to involve myself in a project that doesn&#x27;t only involve writing CRUD and APIs. I&#x27;m pretty burnt out of all these stuff. I feel I&#x27;m doing the mindless programming even if I&#x27;m solving interesting problems in a while. I think I&#x27;m not working on something important enough, and will soon lose my passion for development. To fix this I have thought of three options-<p>i. help the open source community, because without it I&#x27;d probably be selling peanuts in the railway station,<p>ii. start working on to hardware&#x2F;IOT with a lot of learning (Logic, Computer architecture, signals, boards, basic electrical, etc.)<p>iii. work on a technology that is promising, as well as interesting enough for coming years, like ML&#x2F;AI&#x2F;DL<p>I&#x27;m not a native speaker of english, and belong to the 3rd world country in South-East Asia, please pardon my ignorance of language.

Then again, the way Flutter works is pretty novel for the space so it&#x27;s clearly not a marketing-only play.<p>Upfront I want to say that I fully recognize that disregarding dart is a childish thing to do, I mean to try building a not-bad flutter app as early as this weekend (I got my fill of nativescript-vue recently and liked it but want to see what else is out there), also I&#x27;ve watched and read enough about flutter that it&#x27;s about time that I actually built something with it. Also, I&#x27;m not a fan of Java&#x27;s semantics and ergonomics (though it&#x27;s better than a large group of other languages), but I do always hear nice things about Kotlin. I&#x27;ve programmed in OOP but don&#x27;t really want to any more -- structs + methods + interfaces&#x2F;typeclasses&#x2F;traits (i.e. golang, haskell and rust) are like 100% of what I want out of &quot;OOP&quot; approaches now, don&#x27;t want the rest that comes with it in java land.<p>On that note, what do you think about Reactive programming (relatively recently announced as BLoCs in flutter)? I&#x27;m not sure I actually like trying to have primary data processing paradigm for applications, but I know it&#x27;s a very popular approach -- I find an Observable gets you 99% to where you want to be, and observables are almost (if not completely) equivalent to streams but no one wants to do that, day 2 mobile app data management seems to almost always be &quot;let&#x27;s add streams&quot;.<p>[0]: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;playlist?list=PLOU2XLYxmsIK0r_D-zWcmJ1plIcDNnRkK"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;playlist?list=PLOU2XLYxmsIK0r_D-zWcm...</a><p>[EDIT] - I particularly like these two posts in sequence on your blog:<p>- <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nikhiljha.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;how-to-write-android-apps-in-2018"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nikhiljha.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;how-to-write-android-apps-in-2018</a><p>- <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nikhiljha.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;a-reflection-how-to-actually-write-apps"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nikhiljha.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;a-reflection-how-to-actually-writ...</a>",2018-09-20 06:46:43

765,"I think there are some morals in the Odyssey. For example, the assembly at Ithaca in book 2 provides some insight into justice in ancient Greece. Telemachus appears to escalate through three authorities. First, is his own strength, second is the people of Ithaca:<p><pre><code>  Now we have no man like Odysseus in command
  to drive this curse from the house. We ourselves?
  Were hardly the ones to fight them off. All wed do
  is parade our wretched weakness. A boy inept at battle.
  Oh Id swing to attach if I had the power in me.
  By god, its intolerable, what they dodisgrace,
  my house a shambles! You should be ashamed yourselves,
  mortified in the face of neighbors living round about!
  Fear the gods wrathbefore they wheel in outrage
  and make these crimes recoil on your heads. (2.57-67)
</code></pre>
And when the towns people refuse to do anything, Telemachus escalates to the third authoritythe gods:<p><pre><code>  But if you decide the fare is better, richer here,
  destroying one mans goods and going scot-free,
  all right then, carve away!
  But Ill cry out to the everlasting gods in hopes
  that Zeus will pay you back with a vengeanceall of you
  destroyed in my house while I go scot-free myself! (2.1415)
</code></pre>
It seems that fear of the gods was the main source of justice in Greek society. Since there were no contracts or court system to build trust between individuals, people relied on oathsand the fear of the gods if one broke their oathto build trust. Similarly, if one could not find justice through strength of your fellow men, you could threaten the wrongdoers with a curse. If they feared the gods, they make respond.<p>In such a society an atheist or godless person could not be trusted. Right after Telemachus threatens the suitors with a curse, Zeus sends a sign down in the form of two eagles. One of the old townsmen, who excelled in reading omens and bird signs, said that the eagles were a sign from Zeus that the suitors would get what is coming to them. And the suitors respond:<p><pre><code>  Stop, old man!
  Eurymachus, Polybus son, rose up to take him on.
  Go home and babble your omens to your children
  save them from some catastrophe coming soon.
  Im a better hand than you at reading portents.
  Flocks of birds go fluttering under the suns rays,
  not all are fraught with meaning. (2.17783)
</code></pre>
To the Greeks that read this, I think the Odyssey would be affirmation that the gods did exist and that the suitors were in the wrong. Perhaps this could be interpreted as a moral lesson?<p>(Quotes are taken from the excellent Robert Fagles translation)",2018-10-16 14:51:53

And in term of app performance Flutter appears to do better as it doesn&#x27;t relies on a javascript bridge like React Native does (which seems to be the reason for slow performance at times).<p>Could all these be signs that it is the beginning of the end (so to speak) for React Native as the &quot;latest and greatest&quot; and could Flutter end up supplanting it as the framework of choice to develop for both platforms?",2018-10-21 12:49:22
767,"This is a Quora answer of mine from (sigh) 2011:<p>I _like_ vinyl, but I&#x27;m happy to admit its almost certainly due to non-audio non-hifi reasons. I like the &quot;ceremony&quot; associated with cleaning the disk, dropping the needle on the lead in track, and getting up to flip it over and do it again every 5 or 6 songs. I like the cover art - there is arguably a loss to the world of a beautiful art form due to the demise of the 12&quot; record and it&#x27;s large art-work ready packaging. And, as you&#x27;ll hear on a lot of &#x27;90&#x27;s CDs - I like the 33 1&#x2F;3 rpm flaws, the clicks, scratches, and wow and flutter - when I hear the opening bars of Tear Drops from Massive Attack&#x27;s Mezzanine, I get nostalgic, not for the late nineties when it was released, but for the early eighties - that scratched, fuzzy, played-too-much vinyl sound they used - that was the soundtrack to my late teens.

I think the problem is kind of endemic -- it&#x27;s kind of like all the documentation and everything always <i>starts</i> from a Material component. Like if you look at provided scaffolds and you see CupertinoScaffold in the Widget Index[0], you might expect MaterialScaffold to be an option as well, but it&#x27;s just &quot;Scaffold&quot;. Little things like this indicate that you expect &quot;MaterialScaffold&quot; to be the default resting state. 99% of the time when I&#x27;m writing an app I have the design already and it may or may not be in material style or Cupertino style -- I personally would expect a framework to offer general tools first then the specializations. There are a bunch of other example of components that only really work correctly in the Material context. It&#x27;s not a <i>huge</i> thing, and Google <i>does</i> have a pony in the race (which makes it easier for me to tinfoilhat about it), you have every right to push material as the default&#x2F;make it easier to work with -- but I enjoy not having any such bias with Nativescript, even if it costs me slightly more work to get components that are stylistically coherent with either paradigm.<p>From an engineering standpoint I absolutely understand the automatic crash logging, it&#x27;s good that you&#x27;re able to get the user data. I think you guys are just fine as I&#x27;m more tinfoil-hatty than 99% of the usual developer will ever be -- the average developer won&#x27;t care. I don&#x27;t know realistically how it could be improved without sacrificing that useful data, but maybe a notice @ install time? I just never saw any mention (I read through the docs, watched lots of video), and was surprised -- maybe the negative impression was amplified because I was having issues with flutter at the time.

842,"Here&#x27;s some of the explanation about why they chose Dart:<p>&gt; Theres a lot of nice properties of Dart, we talk some about this on our website
at our frequently asked questions. One of the nice properties of Dart is that it has a really fast
garbage collector, one of the choices that we made in Flutter was to have this reactive style
system where its very common to allocate thousands of objects in a  if not, tens of thousands
of objects in a single frame.<p>&gt; In a span of a few milliseconds and then immediately let go of those objects again. Theres a
variety of ways to do that but Dart, having a generational garbage collector, can handle large
volumes of short lived objects very quickly. Dart also has some really nice performance
characteristics, it has an ahead of time compiled back end which allows us to compile straight to
native arm code, allow us to achieve really fast startup on really consistent performance and
Dart also has a nice focus on developer experience which really got along well with my team.<p>From <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;softwareengineeringdaily.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;07&#x2F;09&#x2F;flutter-with-eric-seidel&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;softwareengineeringdaily.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;07&#x2F;09&#x2F;flutter-with...</a>",2018-12-04 21:01:39

Branding themes are more prevelant on most apps people are using than not.<p>&gt;&gt; they dont get updates to native controls... e.g. if the OS adds some new drag-and-drop capability to text fields the framework doesnt get it unless and until the framework is updated (and the app is updated to use the newer version of the framework). Of course, some things are never deemed important enough to be adopted by the framework.<p>If people are writing cross-platform apps and want to use new platform-specific features, wouldn&#x27;t they have to write platform-specific code anyway if they were native? I&#x27;m not sure this is a newly introduced problem in any sense.<p>&gt;&gt; - Ambitious frameworks that really try to minimize the gaps between apps build with the framework vs native app grow to be very large. They take on the role of the entire app-facing OS API, which is truely massive in todays systems. This leads to slow-loading&#x2F;building, resource-hungry apps. Each app becomes a mini-OS unto itself.<p>I guess that&#x27;s valid; but I&#x27;m curious about cases where code-heavy app sizes have actually hindered app downloads. I don&#x27;t really know, but I haven&#x27;t heard that this has been a big problem?

Theyve got to find a way in, through, or around the framework (in an area it already isnt handling well).<p>&gt;&gt; - many potential third-party tools will have native support and bindings but most wont make accommodations for your framework, so you end up having to support that yourself, or do without.<p>Is this a remark on an incomplete cross platform framework (i.e., flutter needs more features) and that it hasn&#x27;t reached enough popular usage, or that cross platform frameworks have this problem?

And I mean devs in the wide sense here, designers, coders, testers, etc. Some also have to become masters of how the framework and each host OS interact, in order to debug the inevitable problems.<p>This feels like an emotional assessment of having to learn something new.

I&#x27;ve come to love Dart and the whole Flutter framework. I really think it is the best framework to write Android applications. It also works great for iOS were you can either choose to use Material or Cupertino components. It is a huge improvement over the old Android SDK; which is quite outdated in my opinion. It&#x27;s too hard to create a beautiful app with the current Android SDK. To many hurdless. Flutter feels like what developing an Android app should be like today.
Another thing about Flutter is that it&#x27;s also ready to work with Google&#x27;s (upcoming; maybe) Fuchsia OS.

863,"&gt;... but I feel these are not really issues in practice (only in theory).<p>Ha, I wish! I&#x27;ve been down this road a few times and this list came from contemplating some of my old battle scars.<p>&gt; ...as `coldtea` points out below, this is not really an issue in today&#x27;s ecosystem.<p>That&#x27;s not quite the same thing as it not being a problem. I know it can be done, but it&#x27;s <i>harder</i> than when using native controls. This is something the &quot;big dogs&quot; can handle (they can bring massive resources to high-profile projects if need be) -- especially if they control the framework.<p>&gt; ...cases where code-heavy app sizes have actually hindered app downloads...
Well, look around for people complaining about bloat. It&#x27;s not usually the download itself, by the way. Memory is filled and runtimes have to initialize, buffers allocated, etc. It all takes time and uses runtime resources. This is fine to a point, but once you use too many resources or take too much time, it has a negative impact on the app (and as the developer, you have to deal with it in some way... e.g., perhaps spend time to alleviate the issues or perhaps walk away from lower-end devices). Any app, no matter the tech used to develop it can face these issues as it grows. But with an engine you start off closer to the limits and have less control over resource usage, so you generally reach them more quickly.<p>&gt; Flutter renders all of its fonts itself natively, using the same way Chrome does it. Has this been a problem?<p>Hey, if flutter solves cross-platform text in 1.0 as you suggest, then good for them. Believe me, that&#x27;s a massive accomplishment. (Though I&#x27;ll note: if they aren&#x27;t using native facilities, they&#x27;ll have to duplicate them, which goes back to the point on bloat.)<p>&gt; Is this a remark on an incomplete cross platform framework...?
No, I&#x27;m saying apps -- at some point -- generally eventually need to incorporate third-party libraries&#x2F;tools to best accomplish their purpose. A PDF generator, a .csv parser, an image processor, an AI library, whatever. (A framework can&#x27;t include an API for everything and shouldn&#x27;t try, so it&#x27;s not a matter of an incomplete framework). However whatever third-partly library you&#x27;re interested in probably won&#x27;t provide direct support for your framework, so you&#x27;ll have to figure it out and do it yourself. It really depends on the library and the framework and how&#x2F;whether they overlap how much harder this is.<p>E.g., suppose you want to incorporate an image rendering library of some sort into your app. The library supports iOS and Android and can output to UIImage on iOS and Bitmap on Android and their site provides samples showing how each of these work. But you&#x27;re using a framework that has &quot;XImage&quot; and &quot;XImageView&quot;. So now you need to delve into the platform&#x27;s &quot;XImage&quot; to figure out how to load a UIImage into it on iOS and a Bitmap on Android. Maybe you find it works in terms of OpenGL textures and you realize going through a UIImage&#x2F;Bitmap is an extra, inefficient step, so now you&#x27;re learning about how to load directly from the library output into an OpenGL texture and you learn OpenGL textures can have different color formats so you start using the complicated low-level API of the image library to get output in the color format of the OpenGL texture. Whew! What would have been a few lines of code in each native app turned into a couple days of work, but you&#x27;re done and release it.... and shortly thereafter, you start getting reports that the images are flipped on certain devices. Uh Oh... Now, maybe flutter doesn&#x27;t have this particular problem, but this is just an example. This <i>kind</i> of thing will pop up as you integrate the third-party libraries you use with the UI platform. The more &quot;opinionated&quot; the UI platform is, the more quickly you&#x27;ll run into these kinds of problems.<p>&gt; This feels like an emotional assessment of having to learn something new.
Oh, come on. I&#x27;m pointing out an additional cost to adopting this kind of platform. That&#x27;s a real concern to anyone developing apps, not something you can dismiss as an &quot;emotional assessment&quot; (Not sure even what that means -- laziness?). Note, this is an <i>additional</i> cost since you&#x27;ll need native expertise in any case.",2018-12-05 16:28:28

880,Aligning them is non-trivial because of &quot;wow and flutter&quot; caused by variation of the tape speed. Even if your tape player has perfectly stable tape speed the original recorder wouldn&#x27;t have had it. Maybe you could calculate some inverse-wow-and-flutter distortion that minimizes the difference between the tracks.,2018-12-12 14:42:26
881,"Don&#x27;t throw away the old unreadable tapes, I&#x27;m sure they can be read other ways.
Long ago I built an interface to the 1531 to allow tape duplication via my external Aiwa tape deck. I tapped the signal somewhere near the output of the device, sent it through some TTL gates to make its shape more squarish, then it went through a voltage divider into the deck input. Results were astonishing: I didn&#x27;t have any tool at hand to condition the signal, but merely making it more loud and clean did wonders; no more hours spent adjusting the head azimuth. To be clear, a cassette which required adjustment could turn into a perfectly readable copy if recorded <i>without</i> adjusting the azimuth. In other words the problem wasn&#x27;t the azimuth but low signal level (which is <i>also</i> a product of bad head alignment).<p>Now back to those old cassettes. If saving them from one device to another or sampling and filtering them doesn&#x27;t work, it may just be the poor 1531 that cannot cope with a signal too much dirty because it lacks the brains to recognize it, but our eyes could indeed spot the problem. No kidding, In the old days I spent hours for every single music track cleaning them from vinyl scratches by zooming the waveform in Cool Edit Pro until I could see every single sample. Scratches became clearly visible for having a very different shape, often a few samples at a level not compatible with normal music. With time I learnt to spot them even more easily, and after finding them and verifying that they were actual scratches, I spent even hours for a single track cleaning them by reshaping the waveform, by hand, one sample at a time.
The reason behind this was Cool Edit&#x27;s vinyl cleaning algorithm which at the time sounded like garbage.<p>Cleaning digital data should be much easier: one can load the waveform into an editor then zoom it until the signal becomes visible. It doesn&#x27;t have to be readable by a 35 years old 1531, but merely recognizable by a human. Then either correct it manually (slow!), or write some macros to put x 1 or 0 samples where the mouse is according to a keypress. Then one can scroll the wave to a point where it starts an unknown bit; we know both data speed and carriers speed, therefore we know how many samples a bit is made of, this way when an unknown bit is met we know what to search for and based on this interpretation press a key which turns that series of unreadable samples into a nice 0 or 1 of the right duration and frequency. Still slow, but doable.<p>Analyzing the waveform at single sample level would also make possible to correct wow and flutter: again, we know the carriers frequencies and tape speed, so we know for sure how much long a bit must be and apply corrections where necessary.<p>Also, it might be interesting to sample all tracks at the same time into a multitrack file just like the cassette was a single side media. The reason being if the tape got damaged at a point, we can analyze the other track as well (yes, it&#x27;s reversed but we&#x27;re aware) to see if recovering one of them can help to save the other one too just by comparing a probably very similar damage done to two signals, one of which hopefully is easier to recover.",2018-12-12 23:30:18

883,"I am in a similar boat, going to try and kick off a side project during this xmas break. As others mentioned, you should probably consider reducing scope and picking one platform to MVP on. I was also planning on doing a multi-platform project, but after some thought, it felt like doing the MVP on mobile first would be best (for the project I have in mind, it felt like I could get more features, faster, into a mobile prototype. might be different for yours though).  So I think I am going to try out Flutter, for a few reasons.<p>1. I don&#x27;t like javascript.
2. It sounds like Flutter is working on adding web and desktop support, so it&#x27;s possible that after I am done with the mobile prototype, that might be ready.  
3. I am not much of a designer, so the fact that Flutter integrates easily with material components[1], feels like it will make it easier to get to a half-decent looking MVP.
4. I already know python, so don&#x27;t really need to worry about server side code if I need it.<p>Another thing to consider, is if I had just focused on building something, rather than evaluating a bunch of frameworks, I would probably be half-way to a prototype by now.  But because my project is more &#x27;side-project&#x27; than &#x27;startup idea&#x27;, part of the fun is just kicking around some of these languages and frameworks.

This arrangement flies, but is very difficult to trim and has a tendency to suddenly invert as soon as the angle of attack goes negative.

One of the main hangups for those who dislike the web-as-a-platform idea spreading usually call out the terribleness of Javascript the language -- and though I think transpiled solutions like Typescript[0] and Elm[1]&#x2F;Purescript[2] fix this issue, the introduction of WASM will finally completely obliterate this long-standing hangup.

956,"As a counterpoint, I&#x27;ve never liked classical music on vinyl. There just isn&#x27;t enough dynamic range there. CDs greatly improved the matter.<p>Disco music on vinyl also had problems, as the base beat was too much for the groove. Hence my preference for the 45 rpm 12&quot; disco singles, where the wider spaces between the grooves and the faster speed made for much more dynamic range.<p>The K-TEL compilations would reduce the dynamic range so the LP would play much longer, as the grooves were smaller and closer together. That wasn&#x27;t really what one wanted if one really wanted to get into the music. But I liked the K-TEL compilations if one regarded them as a &quot;sampler&quot;.<p>Other problems with vinyl are the crosstalk between successive grooves, bubbles in the plastic due to poor quality control, and the usual rumble, wow, flutter, hiss, snap, crackle and pop.

959,"In practical terms, flutter due to approaching transonic conditions is probably pretty rare. That kind of flutter is (mostly or most often) due to the interaction of normal shocks with the control surfaces, or coupling with an elastic mode of the wing or tail surface.<p>The flutter in the first video is occurring at very much subsonic speeds, and looks to be either the result of flying a purposely underdesigned tail surface, or flying a properly built one beyond its rated flight envelope. The second video contains a wide variety of flutter instances, some of them aeroelastic, some of them transonic, and so on.<p><i>One</i> way to get into a transonic flutter, however, is to be a hotshot business jet pilot who flies higher and higher and faster and faster. The higher you go, the lower the density, so your minimum speed increases. Also, the temperature goes down, so the speed of sound decreases. Where these two meet is called &quot;coffin corner,&quot; and you don&#x27;t always have to fly yourself into it by increasing your speed and altitude; you can fly close to coffin corner, and then fly <i>into</i> colder air or less dense air. No matter how you get there, you&#x27;re stuck. Slow down, and the wings stall, the nose drops, you pick up speed, and hit transonic flutter. Speed up to stay in the air, by dropping the nose, and you hit transonic flutter directly.",2019-02-19 23:17:41

Also my pricing strategy and how to monetize become more and more clear. However, I am still a bit scared by some open questions:<p>1) How mature is flutter in its handling of in-app payments? My scenario is simple: User can make a one-time approach and then use the complete features of the app. Is it mature enough to handle the above scenario in flutter only (= no plattform-specific hackery)?<p>2) Is it possible to have local-only data storage despite having in-app purchases? One selling point of my app is that data is only stored locally, so I would love to extend that claim even to user identities. Also - to be honest - local is simpler than distributed.<p>3) Should I decide to put up a database with user id&#x27;s and their purchase status somewhere - what would be a good approach?
