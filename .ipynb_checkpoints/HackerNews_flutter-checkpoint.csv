The end for others sought,
Watch sloth and heathen Folly
Bring all your hopes to nought.<p>Take up the White Man's burden--

But toil of serf and sweeper--
The tale of common things.

And mark them with your dead.<p>Take up the White Man's burden--

Nobody, right now, would loan me the money to buy a Ferrari, because I can&#x27;t afford a Ferrari (well, not a new one, anyhow.)  and this fact is obvious if you look at my finances, as a bank would before loaning someone that kind of money for a car.

I have ran into numerous issues with it which has meant I have to currently abandon hope of porting this C++ library across to it.<p>Issues I have ran into:<p>a. I can either run the emulator with resume support and no GPU acceleration so that it is dog-slow to use, or have GPU acceleration and the very slow startup of the emulator.<p>b. On my Mac, it will randomly not install or find the device with adb (oddly intermittent!).<p>c. The emulator does not support WiFi, meaning monitoring apps that rely on wireless and multicast and the wireless interface being there are impossible to debug (the app makes checks for the wireless interface being available and uses its address to join an interface lower in C++ land). What&#x27;s the point of the emulator, I hear you ask?<p>d. You have to jump through Gradle hoops to stop the ndk-build system generating its own build script and to get it to respect your existing Android.mk and Application.mk files. Getting it to build static libs involves bulding shared libs and then adding another build command to include that static lib into your dummy shared lib. Static libs that you build in a build process will not be automatically copied to the APK library - only shared ones will.<p>e. My application is having problems with OpenGL textures early on but breakpoints for NDK C++ apps will NOT be hit until 10 seconds after program startup...... this is really rubbish; I can&#x27;t stress how unfathomably lame this is.<p>f.

So the cops circulated a vague description of an average-height, average-weight, typically-dressed Bostonian male as a suspect for a nonexistent crime.<p>The Internet Tough Guys aside, the author did make a mistake in answering police questions.  It should have gone something like this:<p><pre><code>  Cop: Hey my man.

  Cop: Where are you coming from?
  SL: Am I free to go?
  Cop: No.
  SL: Am I under arrest?
  Cop: Not yet.
  SL: Why am I being detained?
  Cop: We had someone matching your description just try to break into a womans house.

I also read that the &quot;vortex street&quot; model for the failure had been proposed but discarded during the initial investigation.<p>After my brief look into it, I got the idea that no serious workers have believed those wrong ideas for many decades.<p>If some high school teachers somewhere say this was &quot;resonance,&quot; that <i>is</i> correct and probably worth teaching ... it&#x27;s just not resonance at the natural frequency of the bridge in still air.<p>*Flutter is pretty cool physics. Pinch one end of a a business card, then point the free end of the card into a fan. When the airspeed gets high enough, the card should oscillate like a clarinet reed. Torque from the airstream opposes the restoring torque that keeps the bridge (or business card) level. As the airspeed grows, the net restoring force drops towards zero and the resonant frequency falls. At zero you&#x27;re toast, there&#x27;s no net restoring force at all.",2015-12-15 00:20:32,10735037

Do you laugh when people give up the power of PostgreSQL in favour of data stores that don&#x27;t offer any benefits for their use case? If so, you may fit in well with our mindset.<p>The work will include: Doing direct integrations with banks that offer good APIs. Expanding our API for other systems to integrate with us. Adding new features. Optimising for performance. Integrating with government systems. Squashing bugs. Eventually, the opportunity to do some mobile development (probably using Flutter).<p>Experience: Due to our full pipeline, we can only hire developers who have a few years of Rails experience at this time.

130,Really think Flutter will eat into a lot of React Native use.<p>So far really loving Flutter.   The hot reload speed is just incredible.   Plus there is some unusual features.<p>One is widgets keep state so can go directly to where you were already at when developing.  This makes you a lot more productive and experiment a lot more.<p>The other is able to be somewhere in the app your are coding and just click that page on the screen and takes you to the code behind it.<p>Also it does look like Flutter is the future as the native UI for Fuchsia.,2018-07-04 13:52:38,17457245

132,"Firebase is very much easy to get started for mobile apps. You have nice console to create project, and as developer you deal with just its SDK, one CLI and simple API. For something similar to Firebase in AWS, you need to make use of Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, Cognito separate products, which has steep learning curve. And then you need to know the AIM security to get started. AWS has a Mobile Hub product which is trying to make things easy to create mobile apps by automate some of these AWS products for you. So now you have to learn awsmobile CLI tool on top of the core awscli tool. And if you develop for the web, they have this AWS Amplify Javascript library on top of basic JS SDK library which has a higher abstraction thus to make things simple (or worst). If you&#x27;re new to AWS, you often struggle with which library should one learn and use. And if you use AWS Ampify and read the documents, it is as if the library is build for React. I&#x27;m not sure why AWS can be so married to one web stack. So much emphasis and priority is given to React and React Native in this library. They will give the excuse that React is what their customer wants. They now have mature React&#x2F;React Native Amplify library thus giving the impression that to use AWS its better to use React&#x2F;React Native. So they spend resource on AWS-Amplify, even move one of JS cognate-identity-js SDK under this umbrella, hoping the world will standardised on JavaScript and React Native for iOS, Android and web. So what happen if you&#x27;re developing a mobile app using Unity, Xamarin and Flutter? No luck as they only have SDK for iOS, Android and web. Compare this with Firebase that has SDK for iOS, Android, web, Xamarin, Unity, Flutter and C++. AWS has an opportunity in AppSync to make a product as easy to get started as Firebase. What is required is native mobile SDK for iOS, Android, web, Flutter, Unity, Xamarin that is not just specific to AppSync and GraphQL, but also add in authentication, analytics etc APIs. Something like Firebase SDK API. AWS is still stronger for enterprise usage. And you cant use Firebase in China due to its use of Google Play services.

135,"[Throw-away for obvious reasons; on HN since 2012; 25 years old]
I&#x27;m one of you who hangs out on HN&#x2F;PH&#x2F;Reddit. I joined CS in 2011, then dropped out to start freelancing (because I couldn&#x27;t pay college fees) in 2013. After three years, in late 2016 I quit freelancing, and since then I&#x27;ve been building utility apps and simple mobile games for the last two years. Some of my apps are bringing me Ad revenue; combined revenue from my projects might sustain me for a couple of years.<p>By working in dozens of small-scale projects, I have gained a diverse range of skills; I&#x27;m pretty good at Unity3D, image manipulation using C++, native mobile apps, system&#x2F;server administration (setting up web&#x2F;mail&#x2F;database servers and containers). Since I have had a passive revenue stream, I find myself spending a lot less time working; I just spend most of my time reading articles on Medium&#x2F;HN&#x2F;PH and tinkering with new technology, without any motive of commitment with any of those (take blockchain and flutter as two examples).<p>My apps might support me for 9-12 months without actively maintaining them. Personally I&#x27;d like to involve myself in a project that doesn&#x27;t only involve writing CRUD and APIs. I&#x27;m pretty burnt out of all these stuff. I feel I&#x27;m doing the mindless programming even if I&#x27;m solving interesting problems in a while. I think I&#x27;m not working on something important enough, and will soon lose my passion for development. To fix this I have thought of three options-<p>i. help the open source community, because without it I&#x27;d probably be selling peanuts in the railway station,<p>ii. start working on to hardware&#x2F;IOT with a lot of learning (Logic, Computer architecture, signals, boards, basic electrical, etc.)<p>iii. work on a technology that is promising, as well as interesting enough for coming years, like ML&#x2F;AI&#x2F;DL<p>I&#x27;m not a native speaker of english, and belong to the 3rd world country in South-East Asia, please pardon my ignorance of language.

The Dart team seems to be reluctant to add new features.<p>Also, managing state in Flutter is a little unclear: documents and videos from Google recommend four different ways to do so: explicitly calling setState(), Streams with StreamBuilder, scoped_model and the various third-party Dart&#x2F;Flutter Flux implementations.<p>It definitely beats native development.",2018-08-07 15:32:21,17707525

144,"It&#x27;s similar, but not the same. The details matter. They&#x27;re different because you don&#x27;t need to deal with a complex abstraction layer to share logic. As in, you can expose an iOS Framework and call it from swift&#x2F;Objc just like any other library. That lets you share tested logic and architecture, and do so optionally. It&#x27;s not all-or-nothing. Xamarin is a different approach. Flutter is a very different approach.<p>Part of the issue when evaluating frameworks is expectations and not understand the plusses&#x2F;minuses. If you are looking for a framework that will do 1 codebase for all logic and UI, without sacrificing any UX or capabilities, you&#x27;ll probably be let down. Kotlin Multiplatform will be great for sharing logic and architecture. UI is somewhat of a different case. Why Xamarin wasn&#x27;t great here is you need to do EVERYTHING in Xamarin, and write custom bridge code when not. It&#x27;s an entirely different world, which bad IDE support for most of it&#x27;s history. Jetbrains makes excellent tools, and if you understand that the UI will be &quot;native&quot;, then there&#x27;s a lot of efficiencies you can leverage here.

198,"Don&#x27;t throw away the old unreadable tapes, I&#x27;m sure they can be read other ways.
Long ago I built an interface to the 1531 to allow tape duplication via my external Aiwa tape deck. I tapped the signal somewhere near the output of the device, sent it through some TTL gates to make its shape more squarish, then it went through a voltage divider into the deck input. Results were astonishing: I didn&#x27;t have any tool at hand to condition the signal, but merely making it more loud and clean did wonders; no more hours spent adjusting the head azimuth. To be clear, a cassette which required adjustment could turn into a perfectly readable copy if recorded <i>without</i> adjusting the azimuth. In other words the problem wasn&#x27;t the azimuth but low signal level (which is <i>also</i> a product of bad head alignment).<p>Now back to those old cassettes. If saving them from one device to another or sampling and filtering them doesn&#x27;t work, it may just be the poor 1531 that cannot cope with a signal too much dirty because it lacks the brains to recognize it, but our eyes could indeed spot the problem. No kidding, In the old days I spent hours for every single music track cleaning them from vinyl scratches by zooming the waveform in Cool Edit Pro until I could see every single sample. Scratches became clearly visible for having a very different shape, often a few samples at a level not compatible with normal music. With time I learnt to spot them even more easily, and after finding them and verifying that they were actual scratches, I spent even hours for a single track cleaning them by reshaping the waveform, by hand, one sample at a time.
The reason behind this was Cool Edit&#x27;s vinyl cleaning algorithm which at the time sounded like garbage.<p>Cleaning digital data should be much easier: one can load the waveform into an editor then zoom it until the signal becomes visible. It doesn&#x27;t have to be readable by a 35 years old 1531, but merely recognizable by a human. Then either correct it manually (slow!), or write some macros to put x 1 or 0 samples where the mouse is according to a keypress. Then one can scroll the wave to a point where it starts an unknown bit; we know both data speed and carriers speed, therefore we know how many samples a bit is made of, this way when an unknown bit is met we know what to search for and based on this interpretation press a key which turns that series of unreadable samples into a nice 0 or 1 of the right duration and frequency. Still slow, but doable.<p>Analyzing the waveform at single sample level would also make possible to correct wow and flutter: again, we know the carriers frequencies and tape speed, so we know for sure how much long a bit must be and apply corrections where necessary.<p>Also, it might be interesting to sample all tracks at the same time into a multitrack file just like the cassette was a single side media. The reason being if the tape got damaged at a point, we can analyze the other track as well (yes, it&#x27;s reversed but we&#x27;re aware) to see if recovering one of them can help to save the other one too just by comparing a probably very similar damage done to two signals, one of which hopefully is easier to recover.",2018-12-12 23:30:18,18668632

204,"That clears things up. I&#x27;m glad that my concerns were a misinterpretation.<p>I myself have been in your shoes in terms of not being able to communicate hard-earned lessons to those less experienced. I don&#x27;t have a remedy for that other than time. The problem is that if devs follow your advice at face value, they may not run into issues but they can&#x27;t internalize what they never ran into. Only after they&#x27;ve learned enough can you communicate by analogy in a way that&#x27;s meaningful. Another trap is that being an expert in one subject area is often dismissed in others which seems reasonable for those with singular depth of knowledge. I&#x27;ve encountered this with mobile dev where I had highly transferable desktop GUI experience to make mobile dev straight forward but until I demonstrated it others would have no clue. Also, the differences in languages tend to be mostly syntactic but some consider that you either know or don&#x27;t know a language.<p>Another thing that has helped greatly in my situation is pair programming in a small startup. I had already done some mobile &amp; web dev tutorials but pairing on production code fills in the details. It shows how much of what you already know is relevant. Eventually they also pick up better ways of doing things when you either build it a different way but best when you&#x27;re fixing an issue that was done a poor way.<p>This pattern has repeated enough that I&#x27;ve come to terms with it--any time I&#x27;m at a new startup, I give it 6mo-1yr for the team and management to fully figure it out.<p>&gt; That&#x27;s what I mean by &quot;missing opportunities to less experienced engineers&quot; : I might have the upper hand when it comes to tech vision and making good long term architecture decisions, but this isn&#x27;t nearly as immediately useful (or appealing to a business partner) as their ability to actually get dev shit done and code a product prototype over the week-end.<p>This is a key point, worth seeing from another perspective. Consider that delivering end-user visible features quickly is actually more valuable &#x27;in the present&#x27; and long term architecture is for later. We&#x27;ve gone through 4 products&#x2F;pivots in two years, having spent good architecture&#x2F;engineering on any product but the last would have been a waste (and we did spend it on the second one). Thing is, we never know which product is the last one. The cadence that&#x27;s been working out is that others develop new features on products and I pair with other devs sometimes building features but more often improving existing ones by extending them, refactoring them, or simply fixing bugs and making them more reliable&#x2F;performant. Retros and the occasional Lunch &amp; Learn to share with the extended team to round it out. The most important thing is that it&#x27;s all done without pointing fingers (or right&#x2F;wrong labels). Under the same circumstances I would likely behave similarly, so it&#x27;s best to think of everyone being on a similar path, just at different points. Having written this I think the biggest change was in myself having more patience and seeing more experience&#x2F;knowledge as just that to be shared and not any kind of superiority. [Less than perfect: I have been known to &#x27;go rogue&#x27; on specific issues (not recently) though it&#x27;s mostly worked out.]<p>Edit: Do play with a newer framework or two.

226,"1. It&#x27;s great but it&#x27;s moving too fast sometimes. RN ecosystem is pretty bad so no way I would recommend any less mature alternatives (flutter for example).<p>2. Heard of Elm and unidirectional data flow (flux, redux...). Didn&#x27;t use Elm, but did use redux and flux. It makes it easier to discover what is going on in the code which means faster bug fixes, faster features...<p>3. No, I did not<p>4. I don&#x27;t care as I never plan to be Swift developer<p>5.

I was starting to question my range of interests versus what others were claiming are standard.<p>I find knowing both backend and frontend to be hugely important in the design of both systems independently.<p>I&#x27;ve been involved in tech for 2 decades now.

232,"I like C#, and I <i>love</i> strong, static typing. If C# had structural typing (like TypeScript does) or just a more expressive type system in general, I&#x27;d call it hands-down the best stack to work with for web apps right now.<p>However, it&#x27;s ridiculous to call JavaScript and Python hipster languages. JavaScript is probably the most widely-known and widely-used language, and the only reason is that it&#x27;s the only thing browsers understand for now. For most of its lifespan, no one was choosing it because it was &quot;cool&quot; or niche-y. You could say Node started as a hipster project, but even that has a strong business justification: using a single language on the front and back end.<p>It&#x27;s also hard to call Dart a hipster language these days because you need to use it if you want to write Flutter apps.

237,"&gt; Yeah, but someone needs to actually develop ChromeOS, without Pixelbooks management might decide to focus elsewhere.<p>I really, really doubt that. I don&#x27;t think you understand how ubiquitous Chromebooks are becoming to the education space. Last I heard, in the US, 60%+ of all school provided computers are Chromebooks. School SysAdmins love them because they&#x27;re dirt cheap and can be provisioned quickly.<p>From Google&#x27;s perspective it&#x27;s great too. Between Google Classroom and the way chromebook device management works, students have to have a google account to be able to go to school. There&#x27;s rules on what data can collect, but still, kids are forced into the Google ecosystem at a young age.<p>ChromeOS doesn&#x27;t need the pixelbook to survive, it provides an enormous amount of value on its own.<p>&gt; And right now from the outside it feels like there is a ramping internal politics going on with ChromeOS, Android, PWA, Flutter, Fuchsia, Kotlin, Dart teams<p>100% agree there.
