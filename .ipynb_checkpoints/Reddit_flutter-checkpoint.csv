1,"Note: grammar and tenses arent my strong suite

The sounds of laughter slice through the silence. Echoing through the vents I hear both feminine and masculine voices. My emotional detector flashes he words happiness and joy across my vision. Not recognizing these emotions, I frown. The shackles holding my arms above me jingle as I shift to the other side of the wall, closer to the vent. Though Im surrounded by darkness - not a shred of light weeping through the bars of my cell or he bent above me - my night vision allows me to see everything. Rust squeaks as my joints are moved in ways they havent been able to in years. The amount of times water has flooded my cell and the surrounding hallway is unaccounted for. Closing my eyes, I set my sensors on high and searched the area around me for some sort of connection, a signal. A beep informed me that indeed, there was a very faint connection. A spark of something fluttered in my chest as I focused on connecting to the source.

Moments tick by and a shriek pierces my thoughts, startling me. Frustrated, I concentrate harder, turning off the ability to hear. My foot vibrates and blinks green. The first time its ever been green in the 10 years I have existed. The word hope flashes across my eyes as I contort my hand to free myself from the chains. I stand up and every metal part of me groans in protest. I reach my hand up into the vents and try getting a better signal.
The green blinks faster until it stays on. I bite my lip as images and memories flood my brain. A young girl and a young boy playing catch with The Creator in a sunny park. The Creator sitting on a bed reading the two other Weapons a story. My hand clenches into a fist. Rage repeats across my vision in bright red lettering. A danger warning. Accessing my hearing again, I listen for the sounds of happiness. A dog barks, the sound vibrating through the vents into my ear. I touch the back of my hand and press a button. The dog whines in agony as the small voices begin to get panicked. I can hear His voice as he tries to calm the children. I press the button again, then once more. Two thumps sound above me. Silence once more.

Triumphant, I sit back down and shackle up my hands above me. Running footsteps and soft weeps come closer as the metal doors are pulled open with effort. Enraged, The Creator opens my cell and glares at me. Innocently I say, What? Its not like I couldve done it. Im all tied up remember? He ground his jaw and took several steps toward me before crouching down to look me in he eye.
Why? Tears streak down his face and I grin.
I saved them from the inevitable. The empty cells down the hall were for them, no? He leans back on his heels. 
You were an accident. An abomination. They didnt deserve your wrath.
But you do, isnt that right? Suddenly I kick out my leg, my foot cracking against his skull as I slip out of the chains. I grip his hair and slam it into the sharp nail jutting from the floor. I dislodge his skull, then slam it down again, and again, and again. Any warning signs and beeps are lost in the background as I continue to mutilate The Creator.

I throw his body down and stand up once Im finished.  I wipe blood off my hands onto my pants, then walk out the open door.",2018-06-14 16:02:20
2,"It depends on how you route the wastegate and boost controller hoses, and the type of electronic boost controller used. I've tuned a few 3-port boost solenoids and they usually flutter like this. It's the sound of the solenoid opening and closing. I could even hear it when I ran just a 3-port BCS and the stock internal wastegate on my WRX. It was even more pronounced with the external wastegate.",2018-06-14 16:08:44
3,"I've been through something like this on your wife's end. Luckily, I didn't bring children into it. 

Basically, she feels bored and pinned down. She perceives (either rightly or wrongly; it doesn't really matter) that she's missing out on life and all the fun she could have had in her 20's by being a married mother from 18/yo on. To her, the world outside of her marriage is all chocolate and roses and vacations and fluttery romance BECAUSE she has none of the stress of *actually* operating on her own and dealing with the consequences of her actions.

You have no choice but to let her go, making a custody decision based on what is right for the kids. There is absolutely nothing you or any therapist on earth can do or say to change her perceptions. Let her go; don't look back. It is almost certain she will have regrets and want to come back - you are her ""safety net"" - don't take the bait. She needs to really and truly ""grow up"" - for her and your children's own sake. And you need to move on, for your and your children's own sake.",2018-06-14 16:15:26
4,Can you link me to a bov that gives you a fluttering sound instead of the pshhhh or chirp? I've never seen/heard of this,2018-06-14 16:16:22
5,"Thanks for the shootout, that was great! The El Cap and Nemesis sound fantastic and both are quite a bit more bright and sparkly than the Zoom. I actually use that Zoom Tape Echo quite a bit as a standard delay. It sounds good but it is pretty boring. I wish it had controls for EQ, tape degrade, and wow/flutter.",2018-06-14 16:20:00
6,"These guys are gorgeous.

I've hatched two Luna moths. The first, I found a papery looking cocoon, brought it inside. No idea what it was going to hatch into. It looked closed to hatching, and would move if you touched it. It hatched when I was out and climbed out of the container and I could not locate it anywhere in my room. Then I heard it fluttering, he was in the curtains fluttering his wings to pump them up. They have to be vertical for that. Grabbed him and took him outside to plump up the rest of the way and fly off. 

The second was a fat caterpillar with the eyespots of a luna caterpillar. He cocooned up and hatched a few weeks later and we released her (gender can be identified by the fullness of the antennae in the adult moth) too. I kinda wanted to keep her, but my husband thought these moths are so awesome, they needed to be given a chance to breed and make more.

7,"You'd get yelled at a lot, and singled out. But during this they arent aloud to make you do exercises as punishment so really itd just be a lot of angry RDCs yelling at you and being in your face. Now say its later in bootcamp and you're clear and fit for full duty, they would ""beat"" you. During my time in boot we had this guy in my division who would always smile and laugh while at attention, and ive seen him get beaten for 45 minutes damn near everyday. A beating consists of exercises on a card an rdc has, it includes: push ups, jumping jacks, squats, curl ups (sit ups), flutter kicks, ten count core builders, air chairs, and pillar bridges. Basically they are allowed to make you do a certain amount of each exerxise and the beating shouldnt last longer then 45 minutes. ",2018-06-14 16:38:44
8,"If were dating already, does she treat me the way she wants to be treated?

And does she make my heart flutter and my dick hard within a minute of seeing her?

Maybe not the last bit.",2018-06-14 16:40:31
9,"Fascinating!

 Since George Lucas was heavily inspired by Eastern myth, its possible the whills are something akin to the eight immortals of Chinese myth or the rishis of Indian mythology, immortal enlightened beings who could see the past, the present and the future.  
Here is a quote I found about the eight immortals which sounds a lot like the force ghosts and force priestess Yoda met\-  
 *They are immune to heat and cold, untouched by the elements, and can  fly, mounting upward with a fluttering motion. They dwell apart from the  chaotic world of man, subsist on air and dew, are not anxious like  ordinary people, and have the smooth skin and innocent faces of  children. The transcendents live an effortless existence that is best  described as spontaneous. They recall the ancient Indian ascetics and  holy men known as i who possessed similar traits.*   


The midichlorians could be the individual soul communicating with the higher beings i.e. these whills.

To be fair to the new lucasfilm comic writers, they may have co\-opted some of the ideas that George Lucas had in comics like the Han Solo comic where he interacted with glowing orbs referred to as 'witnesses'. Those could be a manifestation of the whills.

10,"When writing multiplatform apps using frameworks like react native, flutter etc eventually you end up writing lot of native code for each platform to suit the requirements. I think the better way is to write business logic in kotlin for both iOS and Android. And for UI layer use respective native languages. ",2018-06-14 16:42:25
