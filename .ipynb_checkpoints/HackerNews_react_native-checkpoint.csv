2,"I think in either the first or second keynote back to when React native was announced they talked about their reasoning behind using flexbox. I think it&#x27;s also &#x27;the good&#x27;.

6,"That&#x27;s me in the video (hi!).<p>Re: pico. You&#x27;d be surprised what editors new employees and interns use when presented with a shell prompt :-D. At FB everyone is free to use their editor of choice...we don&#x27;t force Nuclide on them.<p>Re: what&#x27;s different. Xcode does Objective-C well. IntelliJ does Java well. PHPStorm does PHP well. Tons of editors do JS well. As soon as you start mixing technologies, the IDEs quickly degrade in overall usefulness and you basically have an IDE for one tech and a dumb text editor for the other. Nuclide is opinionated and provides a nice integrated end-to-end experience if you buy into the tech it supports. If you don&#x27;t use any of that tech (Hack, react, buck, react native, flow, phabricator, mercurial, etc) or only use 1 language&#x2F;platform at a time (like a pure objective-c iOS app) then Nuclide basically is Atom.<p>Nuclide&#x27;s value is super apparent with React Native. You need to be able to edit JS and Objective-C and eventually Java, and it would be nice to have all the autocomplete&#x2F;click-to-symbol&#x2F;code search goodies for all three. Let alone debugging all of them and jumping between the stacks. No IDE provides all the features you need for a project like React Native out of the box. So we built one (leveraging Atom of course). It is magic working on a React Native app and using the same debugging UI to step through the JS, and then the Objective-C, and then using the SAME interface to debug your Hack code on the server.<p>Finally, over time you&#x27;ll start to see a bunch of really, really smart integration with tools and libraries like Relay and GraphQL. We already have some internally--I can &quot;click to definition&quot; in a GraphQL query and see where it is defined in JS, and then click through and see where it is implemented in Hack on the server. Simple symbol search can&#x27;t do that and spanning multiple languages and stacks is unsupported by most IDEs. Nuclide is opinionated so we can do deep integration like that...we leave the general editor-stuff to Atom proper.<p>Re: clumsy demo. I actually converted from vim when we started Nuclide...I even used vim for most of my JS&#x2F;Android&#x2F;Hack&#x2F;iOS programming. For the demo I didn&#x27;t install the vi bindings because I wanted fewer things that could go wrong. Because I wasn&#x27;t a huge IDE user previously you see me using the mouse a ton instead of (generally) standard IDE keyboard shortcuts.",2015-06-24 01:37:07,9769052
7,"I do think the author overstates their importance. All of the technologies he listed aren&#x27;t exactly earth shattering; the web would be the same as it was yesterday if these technologies disappeared today. For example, react &quot;native&quot;; were apps not built before that? The only thing that did was let JavaScript devs write for iOS. Have apps increased in quality since react native? No. It just made it easier for JS devs to not learn Swift or Objective C. But it hasn&#x27;t innovated much in terms of the user. Most of what they&#x27;ve done has been in Javascript frameworks; how innovative is that really? I actually like React, but it isn&#x27;t like they&#x27;ve invented HTTP. It&#x27;s just another framework. I can do some cool stuff, but nothing that could be done before. It all feels like a self congratulatory circle jerk with actual user-level improvements that would not be particularly noticeable by the average user; the Facebook UX I am presented on the web is still the same cluttered mess it has always been. So what magic is this innovation actually creating? Just because we like a particular framework doesn&#x27;t elevate it to the level of earth shattering.

Not to mention all the DevOps, managing CloudFormation scripts, VPCs, proxies, load balancing, dns, ssl, cdn, database schema, the list goes on, and that&#x27;s before there has been any original development at all.<p>With react native and electron (I haven&#x27;t found the atom browser or vs code weirdly restricted) the web stack is moving into desktop territory and with serverless frameworks becoming more prevelent hopefully this will make writing original software easier with less redundant work.<p>As to your point about data processing needing a custom backend, I see the exact opposite.

19,Instead of react native you can also just reuse the UI-code directly for the mobile deployment. Just add meta tags like apple-mobile-web-app-capable=true and style with @media-rules.<p>To be fair &quot;just&quot; might be over simplifying things a bit. I&#x27;ve been doing this for an application and thinking that it actually would be a benefit to have a different code bases for the desktop and mobile editions.

20,"While I can&#x27;t argue the shortcomings of js, it&#x27;s hard to not see most of the argument as a strong stance of statically typed languages that get compiled against those of dynamically typed languages that evaluate at run time. Both types of languages have their time and place and I wonder if bringing that discussion dilutes the discussion to avoid react native.<p>On the point of community versus big company support I can&#x27;t help but observe what appears to be anti open source sentiment conveyed as fact. While many of us have seen fads come and go we have to admit the wild success and stability of many open source libraries without formal agreements to maintain them. Everything from Rails, to Django, to jQuery, and Linux distros. There is a caveat here that JS libs do seem to die out faster and have questionable quality but again plenty are also great.<p>I think the choice of React Native really boils down to understanding the platform and source. If you understand how React Native leverages the toolkits and interacts with the system I think you have the tools you need to make a good decision.<p>For me I prefer native development where I can easily control and limit dependencies. If I want to hit all devices or most I&#x27;ll build a great responsive web app. At the end React Native is today NOT a production level solution that will cover android and iPhone devices, android is a separate toolkit.<p>My rambling is done I suppose. If anything can be gleaned from this it is to understand the risks and be mindful of the costs of adopting a new framework and dev environment.

I think that&#x27;s the conventional wisdom for keeping a startup lean and not getting too invested in one big idea.<p>as for creating the code with less effort, I&#x27;d say either a good microframework <i>OR</i> a more monolithic one - both have advantages and disadvantages for a small project. the advantage with a node&#x2F;express backend vs meteor for example is that you can just write the API and only add the components you need googling as you go. if I only want an android app that uses VERY simple auth and a very simple db that sequelize can map, I can then have more flexibility and not have to learn as much. there is less code to maintain often, not as much autogenerated code. I can also write a native android or react native app instead of being nudged towards a cordova&#x2F;phone gap solution. the con is that if you&#x27;re new or especially if you haven&#x27;t worked a tech job before your code can get disorganized or buggy, especially if you don&#x27;t know TDD (I still want to learn). also meteor has easy deploy solutions and a lot of magic.<p>similar dynamic applies to sinatra vs rails, django vs flask, etc.<p>as for sharing ideas, this doesn&#x27;t scare me at all if it&#x27;s just a chat with friends or likeminded people - actually I don&#x27;t worry much at all. if someone else can make it &#x2F;better&#x2F; and &#x2F;faster&#x2F; than me then I just picked the wrong niche, I&#x27;ll just need to pick one where I&#x27;m the best next time.

On Android myself and another developer I have been working hit some issues around images on Android.<p>Part of the issues were our own fault: overlaying a transparent image provided by our designers instead of asking for a non transparent one, not using flags like renderToHardwareTextureAndroid.<p>Others were due to our use of the navigation library, react-native-router-flux, which on Android is backed by fragments. This caused a bunch of overdraw issues (i.e previously pushed views, which were not visible were being rendered in the background).

How many desktop apps. <i>NOT</i> utilities but full featured apps (like Spotify and Atom) that you loved either got swallowed up by other companies (Mailbox) or discontinued due to &quot;lack of use&quot; (read: lack of profitability). I&#x27;m sure if you dig deep you can remember quite a few...<p>I&#x27;m a game developer with a background in C++. But I&#x27;m developing my company&#x27;s prototype in electron. This is because I can do it myself without needing to tap a bunch of people to help and find funding. I can bootstrap. Electron allows this and it&#x27;s incredible. I couldn&#x27;t make a cross platform game engine in a year on three platforms using native. Maybe you can and you&#x27;re just a better human&#x2F;coder than me (but seriously, email me in a year with your progress!) but Electron is allowing it.<p>What does this allow? This allows me to release a product (yay) and maintain a product easily (double yay!) and when you guys don&#x27;t throw money at me.... I can KEEP maintaining it because of my low overhead.

Perhaps a useful razor is - if you can&#x27;t state specifically why you can&#x27;t use rails (and don&#x27;t say &quot;it doesn&#x27;t scale&quot;!) - then use rails. I concede that 90% of the time, this is probably the case.<p>And yes, harping on about its age was silly of me. Age does not inherently mean anything.

Right tool for the job is far more important, thanks for pulling me up on that.<p>All that said - I still think that categorically stating &quot;use boring technology&quot; or &quot;just use rails&quot; for absolutely any new project is harmful. New technologies are not always just about the new shiny, they can provide capabilities and functionality simply unachievable with the old. Look at what you can do with concurrency with phoenix.

85,"You can tell it&#x27;s react native if it lags (at all). No native app should lag on a modern phone.<p>I wrote an app that locally loops over 5MB of JSON and then sorts it based on a datetime string (which is converted to a date class) - and it does this every few seconds. You can&#x27;t tell that this is happening though, because the phone doesn&#x27;t lag. It doesn&#x27;t even use a significant amount of battery. It just works.<p>I wrote the same app in React Native + NativeBase earlier, and even though I implemented that in a smarter way, the app still lagged.

94,"So for something like this I would go Mobile first and I would use this new open source technology from Google called Flutter, you can avoid JavaScript all together and go with Dart, even if youve never used it its incredily easy to learn. In my opinion is far superior technology to react native. You could get out a cross platform app with some of the basic things you describe in a few weeks.<p>I would use AWS Lambda or Azure functions for the entire backend for something like this. You could make it incredibly scalable and do it incredibly fast. Both AWS and Azure have great managed Document database you could use to power the features you mentioned. It has never been easier than it is right now to build some incredibly things.<p>Shameless plug, this is exactly what I did with a recent app I built that can take any article and convert it to Audio.
