At FB everyone is free to use their editor of choice...we don&#x27;t force Nuclide on them.<p>Re: what&#x27;s different. Xcode does Objective-C well. IntelliJ does Java well. PHPStorm does PHP well. Tons of editors do JS well. As soon as you start mixing technologies, the IDEs quickly degrade in overall usefulness and you basically have an IDE for one tech and a dumb text editor for the other. Nuclide is opinionated and provides a nice integrated end-to-end experience if you buy into the tech it supports. If you don&#x27;t use any of that tech (Hack, react, buck, react native, flow, phabricator, mercurial, etc) or only use 1 language&#x2F;platform at a time (like a pure objective-c iOS app) then Nuclide basically is Atom.<p>Nuclide&#x27;s value is super apparent with React Native. You need to be able to edit JS and Objective-C and eventually Java, and it would be nice to have all the autocomplete&#x2F;click-to-symbol&#x2F;code search goodies for all three. Let alone debugging all of them and jumping between the stacks. No IDE provides all the features you need for a project like React Native out of the box. So we built one (leveraging Atom of course). It is magic working on a React Native app and using the same debugging UI to step through the JS, and then the Objective-C, and then using the SAME interface to debug your Hack code on the server.<p>Finally, over time you&#x27;ll start to see a bunch of really, really smart integration with tools and libraries like Relay and GraphQL. We already have some internally--I can &quot;click to definition&quot; in a GraphQL query and see where it is defined in JS, and then click through and see where it is implemented in Hack on the server. Simple symbol search can&#x27;t do that and spanning multiple languages and stacks is unsupported by most IDEs. Nuclide is opinionated so we can do deep integration like that...we leave the general editor-stuff to Atom proper.<p>Re: clumsy demo.

48,"The cross platform experience will never match the native experience. Think about on the desktop. The only cross platform apps that behave natively on Mac, Windows, GNOME (and derivatives) and KDE are apps tha have completely separate front-ends for every platform. Firefox is an ok example of this, although it in a way forms its own platform rather than integrating with its host, still it pulls it off better than other cross-platform apps. The Transmission bittorrent client is perhaps a better example, it has at least 4 mature front ends: gtk, qt, cli and os x. This is only feasible for a little free software project like Transmission because its UI is fairly simple, it has a list of torrents, a settings dialog and a properties panel.<p>Most apps that try to be cross platform just use a UI toolkit that acts as a cross platform compatability layer. Qt, GTK, Swing, WxWidgets and Tk all fit the bill. The result is that the app doesn&#x27;t look good or integrate especially deeply into any platform, except sometimes with the platform the the developers personally use.<p>There are few exceptions to this rule. One is Sublime Text 2+ which is built on Qt. Without any customization, its theme looks OK, but doesn&#x27;t match the design language of any platform, and its integration with its host platform is non-existant, everything happens within the sublime text window (no notifications or system tray&#x2F;menubar widgets, no quick-view previews in Finder or Nautilus, etc). It&#x27;s possible to improve integration by intstalling a custom theme which lets the user override a lot of the UI design, including the margins and padding, and plugins are written in python and can access a lot of host platform features.<p>If you want a native experience, you have to write a native app. You can share your business logic by linking to the same C++ code or in the future maybe by using react native and sharing the same non-view code.

54,My understanding is not that. They don&#x27;t &quot;compile into&quot; anything. They&#x27;re run as JavaScript on the phone. The difference is react native calls into native components -- it isn&#x27;t a universal write once run anywhere. You&#x27;ll have to craft different JavaScript for android versus iOS. Hopefully most of your code is business logic or other things than UI components.,2015-09-14 17:57:47

58,Yes me too.  I think redux is pretty cool having started using it for a react native app.  One thing that is slightly weird is that they suggest your single global state is shaped the same was as your reducers then you connect either top level components or others up via their props to specific parts of the state.<p>Redux is very simple and more of a pattern than anything; I do definitely think it&#x27;s better than Reflux.,2015-09-20 08:27:06

So much that to go from apple to fruit salad, you need roughly 200-300 additional LOCs, and you have a very robust Frontend system that, once you wrapped your head around React, has a very low knowledge barrier.<p>However, the good traits of React are not attributable to one concept like &quot;FRP&quot; but are simply &quot;good concepts&quot; that seem to influence other Frameworks to do &quot;the same, a little different&quot;.<p>The adoption, the somewhat small API, the support from a large company, the possibility to integrate it easily in existing codebases that use other frameworks and react native has a much stronger pull than FRP in my opinion.",2015-11-21 15:57:39

I&#x27;d be interested to see the Android emulator and live reload in Deco. I&#x27;m using Genymotion and the live reload seems to work about half the time (as in I usually have to save the file twice to see my changes). It also sometimes can&#x27;t connect to Chrome devtools. At some point I&#x27;ll dive into webpack, genymotion, watchman, and devtools to see if I can fix these things but it&#x27;d be nice to have everything work smoothly out of the box.<p>2. Speaking of devtools, devtools! I could imagine some really nice UI that wraps devtools directly into Deco but I didn&#x27;t see that in the video (admittedly I skipped around a little).<p>3. I love the built in styling bar. Right now styling for me involves having a color palette tab, a CSS reference, and an HTML&#x2F;React native UI components reference tab open.<p>4. I have one more problem that could probably be solved with a 10 minute investment on my part: react with electron and react native require different nodejs versions. React native needs at least v4.0 and I believe electron only works with 0.12.9 and below. Currently I switch between them using &quot;n&quot;. I suppose this problem is unique to my situation but this is also the kind of thing an IDE could handle with project settings.<p>Well this kind of devolved into me listing my pain points with React but I&#x27;m excited to try this editor and I just signed up for the waitlist!<p>EDIT: clarification on point #4",2016-02-10 20:24:25

In a traditional engine, the code for each platform is embedded at the lowest level of abstraction.

I don&#x27;t want a separate extension for OSX, Windows, and Linux. I want all the code about, say, filesystem handling to be in a single place (in neatly separated platform specific files). This applies to networking code, rendering, input, etc. I know at the bottom of the article there is hope of integrating it with the original project, but given that we are starting literally on the opposite end of the spectrum, I&#x27;m worried we will never reach this hypothetical nirvana.

But that layer is getting thicker and thicker. You can say &quot;react native&quot; and &quot;browser&quot; are different things, but they really aren&#x27;t. Both are application delivery platforms.<p>My problems with React:<p>- They try to push a programming paradigm, without considering that other programmers may have different or even better paradigms.<p>- They put too much functionality into a single framework.<p>- Frameworks are a bad idea anyway. It is much better to divide functionality into self-contained libraries.<p>- They try to redo what the web, a huge standardization effort, is doing.<p>- React does not fully support all HTML&#x2F;CSS constructs.<p>Now all of this isn&#x27;t really a problem right now.

And lately I have played around with react native, but I felt uneasy jumping ship to use solely react native for the very same reason.<p>I instead decided to learn Android programming. There&#x27;s really nothing to lose going that route (after all, you&#x27;re learning Java, which is arguably the #1 popular language in the world, so even if you end up giving up on Android, you still know Java), compared to spending the same time learning React Native which has very uncertain future (I would trust it much more if it was not from a corporate entity like Facebook)",2016-09-27 21:51:59

It also means as a user, you do have reasons to be cautious about it, not because of what the license says in detail, but because of the reason behind the behavior.<p>But anyway, this patent issue is just one part of the larger issue, which is uncertainty. When Apple or Android changes the API policy in the future, you&#x27;ll be struggling to adapt to the new reality with what you have. Sometimes it works, but sometimes it doesn&#x27;t.

While many of us have seen fads come and go we have to admit the wild success and stability of many open source libraries without formal agreements to maintain them. Everything from Rails, to Django, to jQuery, and Linux distros. There is a caveat here that JS libs do seem to die out faster and have questionable quality but again plenty are also great.<p>I think the choice of React Native really boils down to understanding the platform and source.

If I want to hit all devices or most I&#x27;ll build a great responsive web app. At the end React Native is today NOT a production level solution that will cover android and iPhone devices, android is a separate toolkit.<p>My rambling is done I suppose.

A script block contains a bit of local logic and event handlers.<p>Component = &lt;template&gt; + &lt;script&gt; + &lt;style&gt;. Give it a name with the .vue extension. Now you can use it like a custom HTML tag.<p>(If you really want JSX you can use it, too.

215,"Xamarin Native developer here,
I started off by trying to create a Pokemon Go Map app. Although I got off to a quick start, slowly it downed upon me that I started spending too much time finding fixes for Xamarin issues rather that programming. I used macbook as agent and visual studio as IDE. Sometimes the deployment would take 5 minutes! I then had to restart the agent to fix it. As a programmer I am rather a person who runs a code, change a little bit in code, then run it again. If I dont understand things I google it or find the documentation. Thats my way of learning things instead of reading through programming books.<p>For me Xamarin Native was slow and rigid. I highly doubt I could make &#x27;innovative&#x27; apps with Xamarin. Maybe it is okay for people who want simple things like a &quot;to-do app&quot; or somethign that fetches list of images and displays it.<p>I wanted more and found no solution for things I needed, so I gave up and started xcode (swift + some objective c).<p>And let me be clear here, if I had spent same amonut of time on xcode as xamarin I would have been iOS dev master :)<p>Things just works much better. You can do anything you imagine with Xcode and swift. With Xamarin its more like find whatever library is out there and try to create something by combining these. Too many bugs.<p>This is no sly dig on Xamarin or Microsoft as I use alot of MS products myself. I have also tried phonegap, react native etc. and Xamarin is the best when it comes to cross platform without a question, but none of these can match true native coding (xcode  swift&#x2F;objc)",2016-11-14 15:44:02

I can also write a native android or react native app instead of being nudged towards a cordova&#x2F;phone gap solution. the con is that if you&#x27;re new or especially if you haven&#x27;t worked a tech job before your code can get disorganized or buggy, especially if you don&#x27;t know TDD (I still want to learn). also meteor has easy deploy solutions and a lot of magic.<p>similar dynamic applies to sinatra vs rails, django vs flask, etc.<p>as for sharing ideas, this doesn&#x27;t scare me at all if it&#x27;s just a chat with friends or likeminded people - actually I don&#x27;t worry much at all. if someone else can make it &#x2F;better&#x2F; and &#x2F;faster&#x2F; than me then I just picked the wrong niche, I&#x27;ll just need to pick one where I&#x27;m the best next time.

The architecture of an SPA forces you to clearly separate backend and frontend, so that frontend web is effectively an independent client querying a backend API, just like a mobile app. With frameworks like react native, you can build your web app at the same time you build your mobile apps, realistically achieving 80%+ code reuse across platforms.

245,"They, like most companies would, decided that getting it out to market quickly was more important than delaying a half or full year to &quot;get the engineering right&quot;. But that&#x27;s some kind of logical fallacy, because engineering doesn&#x27;t mean &quot;designing beautiful things&quot;, engineering means understanding both the theory and the practice, and making tradeoffs so that you get something that meets a variety of needs.<p>That&#x27;s what I see technical debt as. A lot of people think &quot;technical debt&quot; is just bad decisions that accrue over time, but you can also get into debt by taking out a loan -- with interest. I got into debt when I bought my house. Your city probably used debt to build new schools. Governments use debt to fund, well, the whole country. Facebook took out debt to move faster. And then they had to pay it back with interest, just like my mortgage and those municipal bonds that funded the schools and the treasury notes that trade our foreign debt. Fortunately they paid it back by further developing react native, and they&#x27;re still pushing.<p>I think the Facebook engineering team is good -- they simply wouldn&#x27;t survive if they weren&#x27;t, and they&#x27;re doing fine. I don&#x27;t think they fucked anything up. I think they were conscious of the loan they were taking out, and had a repayment plan in place. So in that sense they did the responsible thing, and took out a loan for the right reasons. It worked out well for them.<p>--<p>I&#x27;m very interested to see where react native goes. I think Microsoft will see an opportunity to push against Apple, because people are falling out of love with Macs and are starting to like the Surface. And if the Surface starts selling, the Phone would too... except that MS has an ecosystem problem. There aren&#x27;t many developers targeting Windows Mobile, and there&#x27;s not a ton of expertise there as compared to Android or iOS. By backing React Native, they can get developers onto Windows platforms faster, which means the ecosystem can keep pace with the market if they can keep showing quality hardware especially for power users and professionals.

I&#x27;m now doing the opposite of you as I&#x27;ve just signed my first job post graduation. But Here&#x27;s my 2 cent anyway:<p>I&#x27;m just a young graduate, but so far what I consider the 2 most important things in starting a business are to surround yourself with the right people, and be able to manage them.<p>About your project, you can do a market study to buy time. If it&#x27;s a service, then maybe you don&#x27;t need much more than a landing page for now. Maybe you can fake the product you&#x27;re selling if it&#x27;s a desktop app, and only show videos on your landing page (I think that&#x27;s what dropbox initially did). this allows you to study the market before&#x2F;during coding and&#x2F;or keep your job at the same time.<p>As a coder, the most useful thing I&#x27;ve had in this team is a UI&#x2F;UX designer. Because without him, I&#x27;d lose hours trying to find the right spacing&#x2F;sizing&#x2F;centring for all my divs. More over, always make sure that you understand a wireframe before coding. And most importantly, make sure you have a wireframe before coding. Because maintaining your html&#x2F;react&#x2F;sass will quickly be time consuming if you change your UI often. Especially if the app&#x27;s responsive.<p>Don&#x27;t worry about the stack, use what you know. It looks like you&#x27;re in a rush to make money since you&#x27;re quitting your job. Don&#x27;t learn the latest JS&#x2F;Python Foo if you&#x27;re already efficient in Bar. If you already know react and redux, structure your code such that you can reuse as much code as possible when porting to ios&#x2F;android using react native.<p>Funny anecdote of how we lost many days trying to figure out why our bounce rate was so huge. We realised that users thought that our buttons were textboxes and wouldn&#x27;t click on them. Once we realised that, we simplified the landing page so a user HAD to know that these textbox looking objects were buttons because the only thing to do on the page was click on them. Subconsciously, the users now knew what a button looked like on the app. So yes, sometimes you will waste days on things because you&#x27;re not looking at the right place (in our case we imaged all source of problems possible, but not that users didn&#x27;t know what a button on our website looked like). Try as much as possible to stay open minded, because things will be obvious to you but not your users. Working on projects alone can make this hard to remember.<p>I guess what i&#x27;m trying to communicate is the obvious: don&#x27;t lose any time unnecessary time. Always plan ahead. Don&#x27;t under estimate the amount of work there is to do. Be able to delegate the right task to the right people at the right time while supervising that everything goes on smoothly.

You dont need the headache of the distributed overhead.<p>Just keep in mind that you should &quot;write code that can easily be disposded or replaced, not extensible&quot;<p>For generating client sdk&#x27;s i suggest using swagger. Grpc is there but i have trouble grasping protobuf sharing at the moment<p>For user clients, i would go for react native.<p>You&#x27;re better off using a 3rd party for analytics when you are starting up: if you have the money, I&#x27;d suggest using segment, new relic or even google.

271,"I started working on a POC for a start up idea we had. However, most of my experience is with Java development and very little front end development.<p>My initial plan was to use react for web front end. There a few reasons why I was choose react&#x2F;redux. The final product would need a solid JSON API for mobile apps and an IoT type device. A SPA for the web lets me reuse the same API for all the interfaces. This POC also requires a decent about of data visualization and there seems to be a number of good data visualization components being built for react. Finally, react native could make build mobile apps easier.<p>The problem is that my lack of web development experience is really making react development hard. I decided to actually learn the basics to get a better foundation to build on. But the number of basics I need to learn seems huge as a dive deeper. ES5, then ES6, HTML5, CSS, SCSS, React, Redux, webpack, flow, etc. Also, I dislike javascript so I am not sure if I want to do all the development in javascript.<p>Something like Elm seems complicated but if I mostly just need to learn Elm it seems more straightforward. Should try to learn Elm instead? Will I still need to learn as much web basics as with React? Is the number of library and online resources big enough?",2017-01-29 20:52:29

I recently requested Travis add Microsoft Code Push as a deployment &quot;Provider.&quot; There&#x27;s an unfulfilled opportunity here for Microsoft code Push and Sentry to become an easier deployment strategy in your CI setup. Microsoft is incorporating Code Push into their Mobile Center product, but a solution should exist outside of that as well, plus it&#x27;s surprising such a setup hasn&#x27;t been popularized more generally in any CI setup this far.<p>I know Code Push is just one deployment provider, but Sentry integration on RN hasn&#x27;t been clear and it&#x27;s best to start somewhere. Basically for the top 3-5 deployment solutions, they and their customers would benefit from having example integrations. In addition, manual upload of source maps in the panel is very important too, ie for apps that haven&#x27;t gotten their CI setup built yet.<p>Their problem has been that in terms of JS they started out for web and you can easily put the URL of your source map in the footer of builds produced my webpack. So for web they have always been easy. But RN was always a novelty for them until now. To really increase their audience I recommend they make providing source maps from RN as painless as possible.<p>And they should do all this before Microsoft eats their lunch, as Code Push integration is on the horizon for integration into mobile center. And in that product they will have stack traces for both native and JavaScript, and likely source maps perfectly handled and automatically. There are still reasons why you would want to use a more general purpose CI server instead, such as Travis.

Just use the above Code Push Travis Cli tool. I think a lot of developers would see the path toward RN sentry integration way more clearly if they could see that.

352,"Well, I agree with you of course. Re-reading my comment, I overstated my case somewhat. The truth, as always, is somewhere in the middle. I suppose I was reacting to the previous comments as well, asserting that anyone choosing anything other than the boring, tried-and-true mature stacks for any new project whatsoever was being &quot;seduced by technology&quot; and otherwise an irresponsible and non-pragmatic neophilic dilettante who is not a Serious Businessman Like Me.<p>For the use case you&#x27;re describing, I agree completely with your comments. Perhaps a useful razor is - if you can&#x27;t state specifically why you can&#x27;t use rails (and don&#x27;t say &quot;it doesn&#x27;t scale&quot;!) - then use rails. I concede that 90% of the time, this is probably the case.<p>And yes, harping on about its age was silly of me. Age does not inherently mean anything. I&#x27;d use postgres (1984!) over mongodb anyday. And erlang is older than ruby. Right tool for the job is far more important, thanks for pulling me up on that.<p>All that said - I still think that categorically stating &quot;use boring technology&quot; or &quot;just use rails&quot; for absolutely any new project is harmful. New technologies are not always just about the new shiny, they can provide capabilities and functionality simply unachievable with the old. Look at what you can do with concurrency with phoenix. Look at what you can do with react native. Roundly writing off the whole idea of using this new tech as &quot;magpie development&quot; is just lazy.",2017-04-20 04:51:33

It made me a bit sad that I no longer need my hand-tooled complicated gulp scripts for express dev server, live reload, live rebuilds, and so on, but on the other hand, things work great out of the box.

Use foundation or bootstrap to create a simple, responsive website.<p>If you really feel that you requirements can change over time towards more heavy interactivity, use django to create a json api that would be consumed by a responsive react based frontend exclusively using ajax calls (Look to reddit&#x27;s mobile site for an example).

 What I would do in your shoes: (1) create a nice portfolio of all your work (omit the Cisco CCNA stuff, if you are looking for work as a web developer that is actually a red flag, just put your web work and claim to have done anything you can reasonably defend in an interview), talk in aspirational language about your passion for the craft of software development and always point out every way in which you were involved in collaboration with designs are in business concerns and how that informed your more technical work because your real passion is for creating useful products that people love, not just banging out code (2) write some blog posts occasionally about functional programming and how to write better tests, (3) instead of saying you are from Central America say you are &quot;currently enjoying living in Costa Rica (a US friendly timezone)&quot; or just completely omit where you are and simply say you are in EST, who cares beyond that??(4) explain that you are an expert in &quot;remote collaboration&quot; (5) humans are experts at sniffing out non-native language speakers.  Find a US Native copywriter and have them polish all your copy and pay a designer buddy to make your site look cool and modern, (6) post your resume on Hired, etc (7) ask for $175&#x2F;hr but expect to accept $150 or so.<p>This all depends on how good you really are of course.  Another US bias (possibly valid) is that php developers are paid less.  Bone up on Elixir&#x2F;Phoenix or another hot language&#x2F;framework + react native, do a cool side project even if it is quite small.<p>IMO if you did all that you&#x27;d have plenty of work at high US rates. (just for comparison, $32K&#x2F;yr is about $16&#x2F;hr, you can definitely get up to &gt; $100 or $150&#x2F;hr)<p>All that investment and the resultant relationships have real value so step 2 of course is to hire a couple of your buddies who are also good at slightly better than local market rates...",2017-08-11 06:44:04

React-&gt;Flux-&gt;Redux-&gt;Redux-Persist-&gt;PersistGate<p>The latter is talked about in documentation, i.e., &quot;do it like PersistGate does&quot;, but I can&#x27;t find PersistGate anywhere.<p>With so many react extensions and libraries all having their own helper functions to do everything it seems like we are no longer programming, but instead, we are tasked with stringing together configuration functions after searching for hours for the currently relevant documentation.<p>I think react does some pretty amazing things, but the learning curve is too steep because of fragmented documentation (mostly the community created how-tos are the problem here), confusing abstractions, and poor method naming (thinking about redux&#x27;s `reducer` here).<p>Anyway, I, and several programmers at my company, share your sentiments; you are not alone.

- How much is lost from not being able to do multithreading?
- How hard is it to achieve the last 20% fine tuning of feel and perf?
- How much flux is the community driven deps typically causing?
- Is memory management an issue? GC stutters, leaks?
- Do some UI parts simply not scale well enough, requiring native code instead? e.g. infinite scrolling, charts, complex transitions?
- How mature is the tool chain? Build time?
- Frequency of breaking changes from core? from common deps? Cost of staying up to date?<p>Developing in JS, with all the  pros&#x2F;cons of the JS language, is the very premise of the react native deal. Most issues raised would apply just as well to any web app.",2017-08-20 11:43:04

They do not need native apps. The same applies to developers. Sure you can avoid transpiling to JS but JS also became good enough for people to just stick to it.

There are many more modules available for both platforms (in 2015 you probably found a lot of modules only supported iOS and not Android) - and in general the whole ecosystem is more stable.<p>That said: not everything is perfect.  React Native moves quickly, so there are sometimes frustrating bugs (especially in new releases) that can take a bit of time to resolve.  Also, it&#x27;s not a great fit for every type of app. 3D games are an obvious example of when you&#x27;d want to go native (or use unity).<p>However, after having done native iOS development and react native development, I can say that react native is still faster (development speed).

If you know how to squeeze the performance out of RN&#x2F;React, developing apps in the semi-FP declarative sate-driven way is a dream compared to all the old ways of client app development. People who&#x27;s views are so against React&#x2F;ReactNative usually haven&#x27;t experienced it for themselves. I suggest really giving it try before making these comments which usually serve just to validate  decisions already made. I.e. to make one&#x27;s self feel better about sticking to the old ways. However, I totally understand what it feels like for new tools to pop up that put into question old ways I&#x27;ve invested a lot into. That said, don&#x27;t you think you&#x27;d be better off fully exploring these ways before shooting them down? Don&#x27;t tell me you have--zero people that have grokked the effectiveness of declarative state-driven programming make these remarks. They usually leave some hint at their experience with React. In short, it&#x27;s only you left in the dust :)<p>Give the tools a try, which I know will likely be hard for you because you are likely coming from the Native world. I will say this: it&#x27;s a lot more than just one language to make hybrid apps (i.e. like past tools such as Titanium). And, of course perf will be a challenge. That said, the perf is amazing given what it is. But more importantly, the style of development is what it&#x27;s all about. It&#x27;s so different and so much more predictable&#x2F;debuggable than the old mutable ways. To me, it matters not that it&#x27;s in JS. What matters is the declarative state driven way of development. If you can do that in native code, you&#x27;re basically doing the most important aspect--and basically there&#x27;s no argument from me there. There are some libraries that allow for that, but it&#x27;s nowhere near the extent of what you can do in React&#x2F;JS, given its ecosystem. I lot of work is being put in here to make this the best of breed future of application development. If you can&#x27;t see it, you&#x27;re missing out. Do your homework on React once and for all. You can thank me later.<p>Last point: Walmart&#x27;s tool here is specifically meant for making apps where some of it you want in &quot;actual native&quot; and other parts in &quot;react native.&quot; Without a doubt coding the React style is the best DX for UI development. AND without a doubt, &quot;actual native&quot; performs far FAR better. So what they have here is a toolbox for those with an &quot;engineering mindset&quot; to pick the best tool for the job.

Whereas if it were just a matter of sharing a codebase across platforms, it seems like it would be easier to work on a compiler-side, e.g. by extending clojure, scala, etc. to compile to swift.<p>But maybe thats just my bias because I look at any ui code from anything and my eyeballs start to bleed.",2017-10-03 19:40:26

519,"Hello everyone,<p>I work at a very small startup primarily as a Frontend Developer and after working on a plethora of front-end projects using technologies such as HTML, CSS, JSS, React etc. over the past couple of months, I was asked If I take on some design roles as well which I was happy to do so. I started reading about and learning design philosophies and got acquainted with Sketch for designing and wireframing and inVision for prototyping. The more I worked on designs, the more I really started to enjoy it. There was something about wireframing from scratch, creating designs, implementing the prototype, and then finally building it with HTML, CSS, and JS that really got me hooked. And that&#x27;s when I started to wonder If I was more suited for design than development.<p>About two weeks ago I was actually given the lead on the total site redesign in which I work one on one with the CEO to build a brand new design for our application. Everything was going great, but then we had a company-wide meeting on Friday and found out that our runway is 5 to 6 months. The good thing is we have a 4 person dev team, Q&amp;A tester, a business team, and a social media person so we may be okay, as well as a react native ios app on the way, so we should be okay when we go to investors. But If things don&#x27;t work out I will have to look for a new job, and that&#x27;s where my question comes in.<p>I have some experience, wireframing, prototyping and designing and I can do HTML, CSS, JS well enough. I also have some working knowledge of sketch and inVision. Would I be able to find a UX&#x2F;UI Job and get into the field with the knowledge I have?",2018-01-07 22:25:48

521,"Haha, the alarm is quite annoying. I have custom alarm sounds as a todo now.<p>My reasons for using React:<p>Speed of development: I work with react nearly everyday at work, so a lot of its usage has become muscle memory. React abstracts away the need to think about the DOM, I don&#x27;t need to write any query selectors, or think about what part of the DOM should be re-rendered when. The end result is that I can code up a simple view, and focus my efforts on the complex&#x2F;fun stuff - the bit which counts the pushups. If I took the project no further, at least I invested my time on the most rewarding and fun parts of development.<p>Code reusability for Mobile apps: The alarm uses setInterval to track when to go off. This works well for me on desktop, but when minimising a browser on a mobile phone the javascript code stops executing. I need an app. With this in mind, having a React codebase means I can create a mobile app with react native and reuse code I already have. Also, going forward I&#x27;d have parity of web app and mobile features.<p>I sympathise with those who call for dynamic websites with a sprinkling of Javascript. I think most traditional websites like blogs and simple e-commerce sites are better served by that model. But, in cases where your sites core functionality needs JavaScript anyway, has a lot of state changes, and resemble what would have been a desktop app years ago, React makes sense. Saying that, even with traditional sites I&#x27;d be tempted to use react with server side rendering. Just because I love how I can reason about everything in JavaScript, compose my App from the ground up with components (divide and conquer), and group code by responsibility as opposed to arbitrary splitting between business logic and views.",2018-01-08 19:27:58

Initially I was sceptical, mainly about learning dart. But it wasn&#x27;t hard to pick up.<p>I found the development experience much smoother than react native, things just worked, whereas in react native there were many many small bugs and issues with the many packages required.<p>Flutter IDE support is good with the intellij plugin [1].
Performance, I didn&#x27;t do any benchmarks, but a simple list with thousands of items feels much smoother on flutter than react native. 
There are packages for redux as well in flutter, so state management is taken care of [2]. 
The only downside I experienced with flutter is that Json handling is clumsy, apparently because flutter doesn&#x27;t support reflection, which would be necessary to have comfortable Json-decoding like with Javas gson or go&#x27;s json package [3].<p>Another thing to consider is that react native will render on one thread, and handle the application logic on another thread, but that means the application logic is still restricted to a single javascript thread, which can lead to bottlenecks eventually. From what I understand (haven&#x27;t tested), dart can work multithreaded, having an advantages there.<p>End of the day, I would chose flutter over react native.

568,"I work for a tiny 2-man project and we need to save all the time we can, so we don&#x27;t code review. We actually have an unofficial policy: all code that is directly user-facing (web design for example) is handled by me and all backend stuff is handled by the other guy.<p>My previous company worked the same way though, and it was a real company with funding and customers. It was another tiny startup (essentially 4 person engineering team) and the work was cleanly divided: one person did the entire iphone&#x2F;android app (react native), one person did the website, one person did the backend and one person did the analytics. For an established company this would be a nightmare -- we had tons of bugs in production, usually reported by our users. However, having a really clean separation of duties made it extremely efficient in terms of management, because everyone knew that if they wanted something done on the mobile app they just asked the guy who did the whole thing, he knew the codebase thoroughly and could fix or add the change almost immediately, then would work on the next task on his trello board (which almost nobody else even looked at). We essentially had no management (CEO was constantly gone looking for more funding) so this organizational structure was a huge boon, and allowed us to push out huge features in 1-2 weeks. I think that if we had a full time QA person this really could have worked well, and by &quot;well&quot; i mean &quot;we could have done the job of a ~15 person engineering and QA team with only five people.&quot;",2018-04-15 19:43:58

The app uses React Native for iOS and android, and react-native-web for the web app. All three apps run from the same code.<p>Due to this constraint, the only way to define styles that can be reused across web and native is to use react native&#x27;s `StyleSheet` api.<p>About this:<p>&gt; a button can&#x27;t be both a Google style button and a Facebook style button - and the code doesn&#x27;t have any checks for that.<p>Button receives a single string prop that defines the button style, from there the bool values are calculated:<p>```

For consumer facing apps, I&#x27;m not sure an hybrid (cordova &#x2F; ionic &#x2F; webview shell) approach is really up to par, as the UX is really challenging to make right and performance will be lacking. That said, a native approach requires twice the codebase and twice the resources (man hours) roughly, so the challenge becomes maintaining feature parity and team expenses.<p>Apps targeted for B2B users are considerably more flexible in terms of UX, the goal is mainly to help users get stuff done, so hybrid is more viable here. Which is what we usually do with cordova. Some considerations to bear: using cordova, the team doesn&#x27;t really get much expertise with the proper platform, so problems are sometimes harder to debug because of lack of developer maturity in the platform. You need to design with an eye to light performance requirements, which usually means facilitating inputs and maybe have a separate web interface for complex UI like dashboard and management.<p>If you absolutely have to share code between apps, your options are:<p>- hybrid approaches like cordova, or build your own native web view shell and load your web code manually<p>- react native, which is not v1 yet, and looking at it recently I&#x27;m personally not sold on it yet, many unkown unknowns to actually double down and build on it. But that&#x27;s just my opinion.<p>- Black box compatibility frameworks like Xamarim, Nativescript and the like. They work by giving a common platform middleware that builds to multiple target platforms. There are a lot of trade offs here, specially the lack of control. If a feature is buggy or not supported there is little recourse.<p>- I have read some big companies share code via C++ bindings used natively on each platform (loaded in Java and Objective C). I imagine this technically &quot;solves&quot; the problem, as you can share code and build natively, though I have no idea what tooling there is to help with this, and imagine the developer experience gets the short end of the stick.<p>edit: typos",2018-05-21 13:01:08

603,&gt; Vue Native transpiles to React Native.<p>Why would you not use react native directly then? I don&#x27;t get it,2018-06-13 03:33:09
604,"I&#x27;ll try and boil it down to some points that hopefully build on each other:<p>- In the mobile development there are a few approaches, including but not limited to: full-native, near-native, and webview (these aren&#x27;t official terms, I just made them up)<p>- &quot;full-native&quot; is using Java on Android, Swift&#x2F;ObjC on iOS, generally implying using all the tooling&#x2F;patterns&#x2F;etc that come. This is the hardest in terms of learning curve, Swift concepts often do not translate to android, so it&#x27;s like two steep climbs.<p>- &quot;near-native&quot; is using some library&#x2F;tool that compiles down to JVM bytecode&#x2F;native code but usually implies bringing in new&#x2F;alternative tooling (integration levels vary) that holds the promise of having less warts. This is where tools like React Native[0], Vue Native[1], NativeScript[2] fit in (I&#x27;ll explain how later).<p>- &quot;webview&quot; is when you just make a mobile-friendly webpage and embed it inside an app by simply displaying it fullscreen. Android&#x2F;iOS also has features these days where you can pin webpages that act like mobile apps to screens, and IIRC android &quot;instant&quot; apps are the same concept. These have been criticized heavily for performance&#x2F;platform integration issues. This is where tools like Cordova[3] and Ionic[4] fit in.<p>SIDENOTE: FirefoxOS (RIP) was a mobile OS that took this to the extreme, having everything just be a webview and investing in the browser ecosystem heavily.<p>- In terms of difficulty&#x2F;ramp-up-time&#x2F;vendor-lockin, webview &lt; near-native &lt; native -- assuming that you know web tech already, and that the near-native toolchain is indeed easier.<p>- While React[7] started by targeting the web exclusively (though I think it might have always been a goal to branch out), they built in enough generalization to support react-native, whose feature is that it moved the boundaries a bit -- it works using native platform code to run a JS processing thread, and offers interop to native features directly. So it&#x27;s not a webview, and not completely native, it belongs in the near-native camp but it uses concepts that allows you to treat it almost like a webview app.<p>- The existence of React Native is a huge difference-maker for react. If you want to sell your team on react, the ability for a frontend developer to easily handle mobile application development is a strong selling point.<p>- Since react native&#x27;s near-native mechanism is well known, other projects have started to incorporate it -- Angular[5] proponents (and actually any js app in general) can use NativeScript[2] and Vue[6] proponents has been working on Vue Native[1] for a while.<p>- React Native, Vue Native, NativeScript are all attempts to bring the render-in-a-thread, shim-to-native-code-where-possible paradigm to different frontend frameworks that have existed.<p>- There are differences between Angular, React, and Vue that make it difficult for one project to interface with all of them (theoretically NativeScript could do it, as it supports any old JS app), and those differences are often opportunities for tight integration and developer ergonomics&#x2F;features.<p>- In the end, all this is meant to enable native-feeling application development with minimal vendor&#x2F;SDK lock-in and difficulty.<p>- There are other interesting approaches in the near-native space like <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;flutter.io&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;flutter.io&#x2F;</a> (almost like web view except natively by drawing every pixel on the screen) and <a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lambdanative.org&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lambdanative.org&#x2F;</a> (take a small lisp runtime with you)<p>[EDIT] - As pointed out in the subcomments on this post, React Native does not &#x27;compile down&#x27; to native code -- that is true.

620,"I wouldnt pick flutter since its so new and youre wanting to get to production. I assume you will end up having to spend a lot of time figuring out how to do simple things. You also wont have the benefit of community established best practices to save you from making costly mistakes.<p>To choose between native and react-native, list the functionality that your app will have, and see if react-native has good support for it. If it doesnt, you will have to write native code for both platforms and add it yourself.<p>This adds a ton of learning to the equation and makes the choice less clear, since now you have to learn react-native, plus some swift and Java. If more than a small part of your app ends up requiring to write native code, you might be better off making the whole apps in Swift and Java.<p>React native is very efficient for apps that show simple widgets like images, texts, lists, buttons, etc. You also have good support for playing video (I assume youll need it since you mention coursera-like content).<p>Some advice if you pick that route:
- Dont be fooled by its simplicity. You can make an app in hours, but if its non trivial you will require more time to really polish it
- React code can get messy fast, its easy to lose track of where state changes happen. Choosing a well known architecture and sticking with it (ex: redux) is super helpful as complexity grows
- to get to 60fps, you need to be very precise on how and when to make state&#x2F;U.I updates, so the optimization phase can take a while. I often end up going through all components in a tree to manually disable un-necessary re-renders, or delay re-rendering after some animation has completed.
- dont use react-router, its not suited for native needs (it keeps all previous views from the stack active which creates all sorts of problems)<p>Compared to learning two languages for making an iOS and Android app, react native is incredibly fast and efficient, especially when you come from the web.

694,"The thing that I still don&#x27;t know about are how would things like data persistence be handled in a cross platform manner?<p>I recently built a kotlin Android app for work, and our architecture is tightly coupled to Android&#x27;s Room database and LiveData objects. Obviously if we build it to be cross platform we wouldn&#x27;t be able to use a Room database or LiveData objects on an iOS device. Would we have to roll our own persistence layer in a cross platform application? Or would we share business logic but still write a persistence layer using platform specific code?<p>It&#x27;s not just persistence too. Any lower level API provided by the platform would still need to be written twice, right? Accessing the camera, the devices GPS location, or anything hardware related still needs an implementation for both platforms. Or would we eventually see libraries that would abstract this layer out, similar to react native?<p>Edit: Another thought...I haven&#x27;t done much iOS development but the whole async nature of Android apps with the UI thread and background threads also seems like it would be a nightmare to deal with in a cross platform way. Does iOS involve a lot of async threads?",2018-09-14 17:30:26

721,React and react native is a fantastic design and a great project. It has been so successful that it is still having some growing pains.,2018-11-23 23:15:23
722,"BTW, for those looking for another option other than Flutter and React Native, check out NativeScript[0], or Nativescript-Vue[1].<p>Nativescript is different from react native because it includes a native call translation layer -- you can write JS that actually uses native runtime objects. It&#x27;s also got excellent support for cross platform applications that reach down to native on both platforms, and can meld right in with a fully native app as well, and is thoroughly F&#x2F;OSS (they take the marketplace approach to monetization).<p>Nativescript different from Flutter in that it has nothing to do with the tirefire that is Dart. Nativescript is OSS and is taking the marketplace approach to capitalizing and recently they got Hot Module Reloading as a result of integrating more closely with webpack&#x2F;other capable bundlers.<p>I&#x27;ve recently done projects (one larger client app, another a small personal project) in both and kept some notes on what I liked about Nativescript vs Flutter (I&#x27;m pretty biased for Nativescript now), not sure if I&#x27;ll make a blog post about it but here are some hopefully interesting points:<p>- Performance tradeoffs are roughly the same for dart vs nativescript, do hard work in an isolate (dart) or webworker(nativescript)<p>- Flutter&#x27;s reactivity is 10x more tedious than Nativescript-Vue. Making an entire other class and doing all these overrides for what should be a basic feature is pretty ridiculous, though everyone&#x27;s fine with it because they just right click in their $IDE.<p>- Flutter&#x27;s data management is not great -- everything they&#x27;ve made so far seems like a hack. I&#x27;m uncomfortable with the build function being on the state object conceptually, InheritedWidgets are just using context as a grab-bag, the BLoC pattern is so complicated.<p>- State&lt;MyPage&gt; &amp; StatefulWidget being separate classes and the State&lt;MyPage&gt; having the build function unsettles me. I don&#x27;t know if it had to be this way because of dart 2&#x27;s type system (which is subpar in my experience, Typescript is better because it at least offers duck-typed interfaces)<p>- Dart is terrible. It is a modern language yet it lacks almost none of the advances of modern languages, Dart 2 was a near rewrite and it it still manages to be less compelling than Typescript, and nowhere near languages like Go, Rust, Crystal, etc. I am kind of suspicious google is pushing this language just because they invented it and can control it -- I don&#x27;t know a single redeeming quality of dart, especially if you consider dart 1 before you consider dart 2.<p>- Flutter subtly forces you into either Material Design or Cupertino -- this surprised me. Flutter subtly pushes you towards material design, which I have no interest in, and I think most people actually trying to create unique app experiences wouldn&#x27;t either. This is a double edged sword, in Nativescript you have to seek out native-looking components, but in Flutter they&#x27;re forced upon you especially at the beginning, and I prefer the former.<p>- Automatic sending of crash logs to Google -- who thought this was a good idea? And to make it opt-out instead of opt-in?<p>- Flutter probably has the better longer term viability because it&#x27;s being embedded into Fuschia and other things google is doing.<p>- I expect Nativescript to eventually take on WASM and <i>really</i> open up the choices for languages to use with it.<p>[0]: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.nativescript.org"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.nativescript.org</a><p>[1]: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nativescript-vue.org&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nativescript-vue.org&#x2F;</a>",2018-11-24 01:23:40
723,I have an enterprise B2B app on react native with expo and the experience is great. Code push (over the air updates) on expo is a killer feature and something which Flutter  doesn&#x27;t seem to have yet. If you are a  small team that uses&#x2F;knows React then React Native can be a better choice if there isn&#x27;t a compelling reason not to use it.,2018-11-24 02:22:06
724,"&gt; reducing their issues to one thing<p>Not at all, I focused on the one thing that was mentioned as the most significant reason for team frustration with react native.<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t want to come in too hot<p>No worries<p>&gt; it&#x27;s increasingly clear you are pretty fresh in your career<p>I was thinking the same thing about you, no offense.<p>&gt;  but taking this kind of negative view<p>Not sure what you found negative about my view. Teams and individuals make mistakes and misjudgments. That is part of life. If you read my comments I said that removing RN was probably the right thing to do by the time it happened.  This is often the case with bad technological decisions in startups and is rational because of sunk cost.<p>&gt;  many_ cases and orgs where it is not a good fit<p>This is why I cite architecture. With react or react-native you really need to know where the data is coming from and how the data will flow through the application. I&#x27;m arguing that the architect should have had a plan for how this would work before introducing react native into the app.<p>Airbnb has done a lot of great react-native work, so I know the issue isn&#x27;t technical competency, but the linting rules Airbnb popularized suggest a very trees-oriented (not forest oriented) perspective on tech, which is the kind of perspective that makes the above kind of mistake.",2018-11-24 05:03:44
725,"You are only telling part of the story here.
What about the connect in the UI? mapStateToProps is called every single time the store is updated unless you provide a areStatesEqual function in each component you intend to connect to the store. This seems much more complicated that it should be.
I have a react native app that receives market data quotes in real time and I have used redux to store all those market data updates along other data and now I regret it.
If I had stored the data in POJOs and implement a very basic implementation of observer pattern would not only be more performant than would have been easier to implement. To connect the POJOs to the UI, I would only have created a smart component that connected to it and that&#x27;s it. No redux, redux-sagas, areStatesEqual, mapStateToProps, reselect and all that.

732,"&gt;Allow me to preface this by saying that React Native sets out to solve problems I dont think are very interesting to solve. In particular I dont think that sharing a single UI between disparate platforms is desirable from any perspective that isnt cost savings and that even from that perspective its dicey.<p>Allow me to disagree. Mobile development is a mess these days. Doing stuff in React native is way easier than native (when there is a module that implements what you want), so most of the time you do things (a lot) faster. Sure, react native needs a lot of work and stop breaking things every single version they update and the modules need to step up in quality.

Creating a UITableView compared to FlatList in code is way easier.
And don&#x27;t get me started with the Android Activity&#x2F;Fragments lifecycle methods mess.
Android Studio and Xcode sucks both in different ways.<p>Even if it was the same effort to do these things in native it&#x27;s stupid that in 2018 we have to implement basically the same things using 2 very different languages and tools. It&#x27;s just sad to see the actual state of native development right now.<p>Sure performance is still a lot off than native but is enough most of the time.

But trying to integrate it with your own tools is up to you since Facebook and the community don&#x27;t have access to that private lib that someone might have.

755,"A lot of people say that you&#x27;ll know when you need it about flux implementations (redux, mobx, vuex, etc).<p>I have a react native project that I resisted using flux (in my case, mobx) as long as possible to try this theory out. The situation I ran into that instantly told me I needed global state management was when I had an index screen for list of resources, and a edit screen for a single resource. I knew I needed global state because I would edit a field of a single resource (like a todo&#x27;s title), save, and a successful edit would send me back to the index page of resources. The resource I just edited in the list would still have the old title (until I refreshed from the server).<p>So I would say if you have multiple screens&#x2F;routes manipulating the same set of data, that is when you will need global state management to make things work right. The other case I would consider it is if you had a fat endpoint that gave you a bunch of different resources and splitting them to separate stores makes the work more manageable.<p>I would love to know when others got that aha moment of &#x27;I definitely need flux at this point, and it would be really hard to do what I want without it&#x27;.",2019-01-05 06:13:27

When I removed the extra syntax it was way clearer for me to understand it. Sometimes, pure javascript with a good variable naming is better.

For you to have an idea, this react native project I developed alone was sold to the client to be implemented in 3 months. The catch was I didn&#x27;t have any experience in mobile development and I was still developing another web project. So I had to learn react native, ios and android development as fast as possible to do a medium-sized app. Having more friction using typescript for me was a killer.<p>But for a backend I would certainly have used static types as it&#x27;s way more critical.",2019-02-26 09:43:52

776,"Correct me if I&#x27;m wrong, but using webcomponents as an alternative to a hypothetical version of react native for desktop apps would require loading said web components into a webview, say via Electron; am I correct in that? If so, then I&#x27;d d strongly disagree that that is a better way of doing things. While I&#x27;m not an electron hater like many around here, react native&#x27;s approach seems far superior.",2019-03-02 01:43:40

779,"The whole thing is a solved problem. You can easily render React apps on the server and send HTML down the wire, then lazy load the rest of the JS.

780,"&gt; I could have gotten the same benefits with SSR and ported it to react native<p>Are you saying that rhetorically? In my experience, React is no silver bullet (e.g. different router and styling mechanisms for RN), trickiness dealing w&#x2F; timezones in SSR, etc.<p>And besides, the point here was largely about bundle size and fast time-to-interactive. Next.js optimizes a lot for developer experience, but you&#x27;re definitely still going to be shipping a pretty sizeable JS bundle with slower characteristics than a hand-coded &quot;closer-to-the-metal&quot; thing.",2019-03-12 19:10:53
