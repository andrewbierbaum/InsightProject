I remember reading about what would happen if a real space elevator cable snapped, they said the air resistance would keep the velocity low, and it would just flutter slowly to the ground.  The weight/surface area ratio is very low.",2006-02-16 02:57:38
1,"The answer is yes!

I've fluttered between the different thinking styles for a couple of weeks now, trying to achieve the ""here and now"" way of thinking and leaving behind the cognitive dissonance. It's hard, but when you achieve it you KNOW it's an advantage because everything is so effortless.

The kind of thinking I'm trying to move away from is what you see in ""Saving Private Ryan"". During the final battle at the bridge, there's this bookworm that has a simple job to do, supply ammo to his buddies behind the machine guns. Because of the cognitive dissonance he stumbles, doesn't have his emotions in order and he becomes a useless mess. He's smart and learned, but he doesn't have focus. In the end he does show some improvement. Everybody stumbles.

So, the answer is yes. It is the new competitive advantage. Use meditation, heroically long Counter-Strike sessions, Movies with heroes who've got their shit together. ANYTHING, to get there. It'll feel great.",2006-04-23 00:47:39
2,"No, they'd eventually flutter down.

Um ... did I just miss a joke there (or did you really want an answer to that)?",2006-05-08 09:23:56

4,"Of course you can be blamed, but what's the point *me* wasting my time blaming people for things I knew they were going to do 3 years back? Last I checked, making pro forma condemnations was the UN's job. You *do* believe in the UN, don't you? Because if you do then why do you need me to act as your schoolmarm, tut-tuting with virtue aflutter? If you really need a schoolmarm, I'm sure a prostitute will do a much better job than I could.",2006-08-06 16:19:59
5,"My fiancee and I were wandering Pall Mall in London when the elephant paraded down towards us. In person it was every bit as surreal as in the video, down to the loud, eerie music and the elephant spraying onlookers in the way.

In the US we have Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, with giant inflatable representations of comic characters that flutter uncontrollably in the wind and take out lightposts, and a few tourists.

Leave it to the French to come up with something truly unique and creative, and the Brits to appreciate it. Somehow I can't imagine this show in the US.",2006-08-17 17:38:41
6,"I've been seeing a lot of yellowjacket wasps around my place since 1999.  In fact, I just recently knocked a nest about the size of an orange off the underside of my car's trunk lid.  I'd noticed them flying around the trunk when I get home, and happened to look up one afternoon when putting groceries in the car.

They also have one behind my passenger side mirror, but I can't get behind it to knock it out.

I don't drive the car every day, and when I do drive it, they are all aflutter when I get home.

I can only imagine what they would think if they could think.  ""Our home!  It's just GONE! The entire neighborhood just DISAPPEARED!""",2006-08-23 04:24:08
7,A gravity-train might not kill the passengers but I bet it would make their tummies flutter.,2006-10-09 22:08:37
8,"You know, xkcd makes my cardioid flutter as well as the next geek, but I have its RSS feed subscribed in NewsFire for a reason.  I *see* each new xkcd when it comes out.  I don't need to see it on the reddit FP.

9,"That would be beautiful if it wasn't for the fact that fluttery things like moths and butterflies scare the shit out of me.

Don't know why. They're like spiders with wings to me!",2006-11-12 13:04:55

12,"Easily explained by two things:

1. the hammer was a couple inches closer to the ground to begin with (he held it by the shaft, with the head of the hammer below his hand, while the feather was held level with his hand)

2. the moon does have a tiny amount of atmosphere, it's not a perfect vacuum, so it's possible it slowed the feather down a bit.  It looks to me like the feather flutters and turns over a bit on it's way down, which wouldn't happen in a perfect vacuum.",2006-12-23 13:04:22
13,"Hey, Quinn.  You are SO fucking drunk.  You want to splatter that ass with spmerisms, but only when the mama has had a proper ""big-O"" because you are such a gentle-man.

Seriously, though -- those close-up blowjob phoots are really hot in a way, hay guys?  Like, so smushy-flutter-haired and such, you really get a sense you're there.

Whoops -- got to get back to watching Buffy.  I'll see you guys later tomorrow when I'm sober and embarassed for having posted this, even though the typing is remarkably fastidious.
