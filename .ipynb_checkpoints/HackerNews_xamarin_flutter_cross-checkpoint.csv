Like JS is the asm of the web ecosystem (no one wants to write its code just in JS, we generate it instead), default android and IOS way of programming have to be be generated.<p>Try Xamarin [0] or the newcomer flutter [1].

543,"There&#x27;s been a C dart FFI for years. Communicating with whichever other system shouldn&#x27;t be any harder than the next language. None of those would be my first choice though. The less platform specific code you write, the fewer platform specific issues you&#x27;ll be dealing with. Plus xamarin isn&#x27;t native anywhere.<p>With Flutter apps using the AOT, performance should already be good.

The app runs using the native instruction set (no interpreter is involved).<p>&gt; Can I access platform services and APIs like sensors and local storage?<p>&gt; Yes. Flutter gives developers out-of-the-box access to some platform-specific services and APIs from the operating system. However, we want to avoid the lowest common denominator problem with most cross-platform APIs, so we do not intend to build cross-platform APIs for all native services and APIs.<p>&gt; A number of platform services and APIs have ready-made packages available in the Pub repository. Using an existing package is easy.<p>&gt; Finally, we encourage developers to use Flutters asynchronous message passing system to create your own integrations with platform and third-party APIs. Developers can expose as much or as little of the platform APIs as they need, and build layers of abstractions that are a best fit for their project.",2018-02-26 22:22:33
545,"No, the efficacy of the direct GL canvas native bindings and the view composition architecture are why it&#x27;s efficient. Yes, there&#x27;s little runtime language overhead because it&#x27;s AOT compiled, but that alone wouldn&#x27;t cause it to win over another AOT compiled mobile device strategy, such as an AOT xamarin project. (And all the other points in that article apply equally to xamarin, for example; and some are just opinion like the xml vs code for layout debate) I&#x27;m sorry, but I don&#x27;t see how any of flutter&#x27;s real performance wins are truly tied to its&#x27; choice of language, and it&#x27;s a competitive market. I&#x27;ll be happy if I&#x27;m proven wrong in a year or two&#x27;s time, however.",2018-02-27 18:22:57
