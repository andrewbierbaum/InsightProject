26,"You have three and they all have different jobs.  The one up top, one in the thick lining around your stomach and another in the thick lining of the large/small intestines.  The primary purpose is to deploy nanotechnology to read/analyze the plant/animal torsos you ate, decide which enzymes and acids will break down the food, then deploy enzymes/acids to harness then absorb the food you eat while also separating out unwanted waste. This ""second brain"" actively communicates with the central brain for coordination on what foods are visibly disgusting and which are visibly desirable.  When the brain in your digestive system is bored, it performs other functions around emotions mood and predator detection.
 
To enhance cognitive function, means grabbing hold and configuring this second brain by knowing how it works and knowing how to turn it on and use it.  After you eat a huge starchy lunch, your brain doesn't work so well.  20% your brain is occupied. When fasting after about the 20th hour (assuming you usually eat 3 meals a day), the stomach/intestine brain snaps to attention and participates in whatever task you are doing.  It partially explains why you feel more conscious and more self aware between 20 and 40 hours of fasting.  The brain in your stomach and intestines are twiddling their thumbs and they say ""hey, I'm bored, give me something to do.""  And the neural nets there start configurating them for the more important task of food-getting rather than food-processing.  It's why the Jews and Christians often teach that fasting for a day or two once per year is great, because it exercises that intelligence beam transfer.  But don't fast too long because then you go into famine mode and store everything you eat to fat.  Women use these second brains to select mates, and call it butterflies in the stomach when they see what they want.  Men can feel the butterflies in the stomach in various situations where you are in a life or death situation and your conscious mind doesn't realize it.  Your stomach is trying to save your life by offering its two cents over a binary data channel, the best way it knows how, in the signal of what feels like a bunch of butterflies fluttering in your stomach.",2018-12-11 12:34:42

Some people used it as an excuse to exploit people and others thought passing on some benefits would keep the natives quiet, like you'd expect, but a shocking amount of people full-heartedly believed in the white man's burden as a duty. Rudyard Kipling (famous writer) wrote a poem about it which is definitely racist by today's standards but is kind of 'nice racism' if you compare it to some other British people and other countries.

Nor call too loud on Freedom                   
To cloak your weariness;               
By all ye cry or whisper,                   
By all ye leave or do,                 
The silent, sullen peoples              
Shall weigh your gods and you.

The lightly profferred laurel,            
The easy, ungrudged praise.                   

&gt;Comes now, to search your manhood

It's interesting I think because he seemed to have common racial sentiments of the time but turns them into a reason white people have to behave well, help others rather than take advantage, etc. To put this into historical perspective possibly the most brutal of all colonial holdings was the Congo Free State/Belgian Congo where the locals weren't just exploited to the maximum but treated with huge amounts of cruelty, so intense it actually reduced the amount of money the Belgians could make from them. The Belgian Congo existed at the same time as Kypling was writing that poem, and continued to exist.

I think it's very interesting because despite the clear racist sentiment involved it's saying that the claimed superiority actually means white people should be self-sacrificing, not expect anything back, focus on ending sickness and starvation, etc. Almost that if white people are so much better how come they aren't acting it already? And it's kind of grimly funny the guy who wrote that poem is noticably less racist than many (but not all) of his contermporaries.

36,"During one of my past breakups, I found myself reading ""The Girls"" tetralogy by Henry de Montherlant. The main character is such an asshole and the girl that finally secures him looks so miserable from the outside, that I felt instantly better about being single.

Also, I remember a book by Jos Ortega y Gasset called ""On Love: Aspects of a Single Theme"" that made me flutter and eager to find love again. And the social study by Eva Illouz - ""Why Love Hurts"", helped me understand the subject a little better and not be bitter about some things. Oh, and ""Thinking, Fast and Slow"" by Daniel Kahneman is my go-to book to understand why I'm (over)reacting the way I do, and it gives me a certain clarity of thought to realise they're just patterns in thinking and that *this too shall pass*.

I usually refrain from reading literature about people getting back together, because it's still raw for me and I don't want to see other people (even fictional) getting what I couldn't. Instead I prefer essays and studies that help me understand myself and love a little better.

40,"Right now, tensions are high on the Iolaran continent of Hestalus.  There are several major powers here, starting with the most aggressive, the Kingdom of Izzaria.  The king of Izzaria has been known in the recent past to make the following moves:

&amp;#x200B;

Creation and distribution of literal tons of high grade counterfeit currency of their southern neighbor, the League of Coastal City-States, in an attempt to destabilize their economy (which is partially successful) and to open them up to invasion.

&amp;#x200B;

Forcing his court mage, Iashan the Wise, to gather more power, even consorting with demons for greater magic, using that to commit sorcerous warfare with the southeastern neighbor, the Kingdom of Slatedrift.  These attacks are blocked (for the most part), but the court mage of Slatedrift is forced to do nothing BUT defend, and even so, earthquakes, floods, and violent weather are a reality in the Outmarches (the borderland provinces), and are threatening to cause damage to the interior Old Kingdom as well.

&amp;#x200B;

Building up a massive military of airships and seaworthy vessels, arming them with as many types of weapon as they can purchase or steal.  These weapons range from ye olde trebuchets and ballistae through steam and oxyhydrogen powered cannon to lightning casters (refined malfunctioning Kay'Sharan high magitek that as the name says, throw literal bolts of lightning).

&amp;#x200B;

Conscripting a worrisome amount of soldiers from the peasant population, threatening to cause a critical food shortage if he doesn't send some of the military home to tend their fields.  This is in spite of the military draftees being rotated from active training to farm work and back again.

&amp;#x200B;

Next most aggressive is the League, whose council is forced to react to this aggression in order to survive.  Their countermoves to date have been: Increased funding to the treasuries to locate and remove counterfeit currency from their economy.  Building up larger fleets of their Dreadnought class sailing vessels.  Ramping up their energy production and directing it to the needs of a ground and sea based military in case of invasion from the north.

&amp;#x200B;

Shortly behind the League is Slatedrift, who has an ongoing campaign run by the Four Counts of the Outmarches to commit all sorts of espionage and even outright assassination campaigns behind the territorial lines of its neighbors in order to keep them too weak to pose a credible threat against their higher technological might.  Their economy is actively developing their airship fleet and their more highly refined and powerful lightning caster weapons.

&amp;#x200B;

Next up is the dwarven kingdom of Thal Todir, which few outsiders know much about.  The enigmatic people live underground, and whatever they are doing is pretty much hidden by distance and earth.  The orc tribes that wander the upperside of the kingdom, though, are definitely marshalling their troops, alliances being drawn.  But then they are always doing that, so it isn't seen as out of the ordinary.  Yet.

&amp;#x200B;

Though scholars keep in mind the last time the orcs came together as a group, it marked the start of the Great Clash, born in the belief that to survive, Orcs poured from their Holds and attempted to carve out a vast empire as they marched into the fertile lands increasingly dominated by the Humans and their allies.  The internecine wars between the Orcish Tribes were set aside, and the Alliance was struck with one goal.  To take what their bloodthirsty God has rightfully given to them.  Dark gray flesh, bright white bone, dark red blood, all of this and more fell as the leaves of the trees started to flutter down on the ever-chilling air.

&amp;#x200B;

Wave upon wave of Orcs crashed against the primitive bulwarks of Civilization, and both came away bruised and bloody.  Some cities were sacked.  Others withstood the primitive but powerful assault.  Women were taken as chattel, carried back to serve (albeit briefly) as spoils of war.  These women were ritually raped, as a sign of dominance of Orcs over Humans, and most were slain.  Those that were not either were rescued by their kinfolk or managed to figure out how to survive in the wooden hut cities of Orcish kind.

&amp;#x200B;

Nowadays, the resulting race of half-orcs born of that two thousand year old struggle is a fractured but powerful population.  There are moves in progress for the various Prides...they spend as much time fighting amongst themselves as they try to breed themselves into a new and superior incarnation of themselves.  Should they ever get their collective act together, they would prove a superior menace to the civilizations residing on the continent.

47,"This shows a better line of thought than your original post.

&gt;Conventional configuration is out of consideration because tail rotor takes significant chunk of the power

Sure and that's a good realization to make, but there are other alternatives to the tail rotor. Look up concepts like a NOTAR and tip propulsors that approach the rotor torque problem differently.

&gt;intermeshing because it's simplest. 

I think you're underestimating the complexity of the linkages, mechanisms, and aerodynamics involved in a intermeshed rotor system. Yes Kaman has demonstrated it successfully - they've even demonstrated an unmanned version. But it's at the manned scale lifting a 6000 lb payload. The more you scale down a project like this, the less complex systems make sense as you start having to miniaturize things. 

&gt;It's not suited for most applications but is perfect for the application I have in mind. 

I think you may need to broaden your understanding of the mission at hand. What use is a heavy lift capacity with a lower-than-typical forward speed or reduced yaw capability (relating to adverse weather capability)? Lifting machinery to the top of buildings? Okay, but what else? How often is your expected customer lifting 450 lb but doesn't want to use a manned helicopter? A classic Bell 47 can lift twice that much less anything remotely larger. If heavy lift is your selling point, why not just throw extra power at the problem with an over-sized COTS power plant or just modifying a Bell 47? Is your UAV going to be cheaper to operate just because it's smaller? If low cost is your selling point, then why make it so complicated?

At a small scale, I would give much more serious consideration to a tandem rotor like a small-scale chinook. The most complex part there would be connecting the two rotors to the same powerplant. You can save cost by using the same assemblies for the rotor systems. You get the full disc loading and power loading of each rotor without major interference effects. And you get a large CG range capability. If you keep the fuselage simple, you can minimize the weight penalty compared to something more compact like a coaxial or intermeshed rotor.

When dealing with helicopters your primary concerns are cost (acquisition, operation, and maintenance) and reliability while meeting the mission specs. O&amp;M costs are huge for helicopters. The more complex you make a helicopter, the worse that will be. Keep everything as simple as you can with as much margin as you can to build every spinning component for service life and safe failure modes. Anything 'impressively' complicated might sound cool to us engineers but it sounds like cost and downtime to people that sign the checks. And often the sad part of engineering is that they're your customers, not other engineers.

Just meeting the mission specs will always be challenging and a long road to go down but that's where you need to start - with detailed analysis. The devil will always be in the details - the stress and fatigue analysis, the performance estimation, hardware testing, and later complexities like ground resonance and flutter. The smaller scale buys you some safety just via the square-cube law but Reynolds effects will eat into your FOM and combustion engine powerplant and rotor efficiencies the smaller you go. 

Something else to consider is the market - everything these days is pushing for electrics on bigger and bigger platforms. Batteries still don't beat the energy density of fuels, but they can be extended with fuels and an onboard gas generator. You might be able to make a case for a wankel engine there.",2018-12-19 13:42:44
48,"I'm pretty sure Andrea (I'll call her) agreed to have dinner at my apartment only because I always spoke to her using nothing but my two-years-of-high-school German. Her English was perfect. Probably better than mine. But the fact that I could only ask her directions to the Autobahn or inquire about the health of her non-existent Tante Amelia, seemed to make me appealing to her in a sweet and non-threatening way.
My intentions, however, were considerably less child-like. Which is why the shopping that night was done at one of those upscale groceries with an international flair. Moules Marinieres is as much of a panty-peeler as anything I can cook, and isn't that hard to pull off. But still, I was busy tracking the recipe in my head when I found myself in the sweets aisle. And that, to my great chagrin, is why I didn't immediately notice the difference between Haribo Normal Gummi Bears (which are designed for human enjoyment) and Haribo Sugarless Gummi Bears (which are designed for use in maximum security prisons as a way to punish uncooperative inmates).
I shan't make that mistake again. (notice you can't spell SHAN'T without SHAT.)
Prior to Andrea's arrival, I sat in my living room, creating a playlist of make-out music and nervously binging on the Gummi Bears I had placed in a decorative bowl because I am fancy.
The doorbell rang, and within minutes we were standing in the kitchen, drinking beers and both of us probably worrying that we were about to exhaust my ability to communicate in her native tongue. But soon that would be the least of my worries. In the middle of trying to ask Andrea if she likes to dance to young people's music, I felt a flutter in my midsection, accompanied by a guttural pronouncement so loud it threatened to drown out my own voice.
Maybe it was because I was mentally refreshing my language lessons, but it suddenly struck me how much pre-diarrheal grumblings sound like German words.
""ENTSCHULDIGUNG!"" was the next thing uttered by my rapidly clenching stomach. Appropriately, Andrea looked up in response.
""Sind Sie Kaffee machen?"" she asked.
Am I making coffee?
I thought I must have mistranslated her at first, then finally I realized that yes, the loud, ominous gurgling coming from my gut could easily be mistaken for the percolating of some bachelor's crappy coffeemaker.
It's remarkable how quickly one knows that one is about to have a traumatic pottymaking experience. Maybe that's the body's way of buying you the precious seconds you need. I was already calculating the number of steps to the bathroom, speculating on whether I would have time to lift the lid to the toilet, when my own voice cried out loudly in my head.
She's going to hear EVERYTHING!
Thanks to an acoustical idiosyncrasy in my building, the hallway outside the bathroom works as an amplifier pointed straight at my living room-slash-kitchen. So that somehow even the gentlest tinkle sounds like I'm pouring lemonade out of a bucket.
With only half an idea of what I was doing, I grabbed Andrea's hand and pulled her roughly down onto my sofa. I must have looked like a madman as I booted up my iTunes playlist, plugged in the gigantic new headphones I had just bought to keep me looking young and hip, and clamped them down over her ears. (the sweat forming on my brow and upper lip couldn't have helped.) In response to her nervous expression, I kept shouting ""You'll love this! You'll love this!""
I spun her around so that she was looking out the window. My ""plan"" was that she'd be so distracted by the modest 4th floor view, that it would allow me to pull my pants off while I sprinted down the hall, silently singing the praises of the noise-reducing quality of my new headphones. (this story will be reprinted in its entirety as a 5 star review on the Sony Beats Audio Amazon page.)
As I slammed the bathroom door shut, already half naked, it occurred to me that I had not been shouting ""You'll love this!"" at Andrea. I don't even know how to say that in German. In my desperation I had been saying ""Ich Leibe Dich!"" Repeatedly professing my love for her in a shaky and frantic voice. But maybe that was a good thing, because as I threw myself at the toilet, I figured the best I could hope for is that she would be so creeped-out that she would sneak out of the apartment, blissfully unaware of the carnage taking place in the next room.
What can I say about the ensuing white-knuckle bowel movement that hasn't been expressed in other reviews on this page? I'm pretty sure I haven't seen the adjective ""Kafkaesque"" used anywhere else.
By the end of Act One of this private little torture-porn movie, I was confessing to every unsolved crime in history. Praying I would stumble upon the one that would satisfy my invisible captors.
Quickly I realized that I had more than Andrea's sense of sound to worry about. Were she to get even the faintest whiff of the weapons-grade sluice that my anus was angrily shouting into the porcelain, I would have to change my name and move to another city.
And so I flushed. And flushed. And flushed and flushed.
And then I flushed and nothing happened.
I have never looked down into a broken toilet with more horror in my entire life. And I once stopped up George Clooney's crapper! (a true story for another time.)
I reached for the plunger, but my hand froze and my heart seized when I saw it on the floor, broken in two and covered in what looked like teeth marks. Apparently I had used the wooden handle to keep from biting my tongue off and had chewed clean through it. When did that happen? It seems my mind had already started the process of repressing this entire event.
Amid the feverish, fruitless dance I did across my tiny bathroom floor, it dawned on me that it had been more than a minute since my last soul-wrenching anal tantrum. Dear Lord, is it over? I asked, quite possibly aloud.
I may have been light-headed and delusional, but I began to imagine a non-ignominious resolution to this ordeal. I just needed to get her the hell out of here. If Andrea hadn't fled the building, vomiting in terror, then I supposed I could pull up my trousers and make a cavalier exit. As long as I could get her off premises and as far away from this post-apocalyptic commode as humanly possible. Assuming that the Diarrhistas had retreated to the hills temporarily, maybe I could even whisk Andrea away to a candlelight dinner at Bernardo's. How impulsive!
My first few steps back toward the living room were tentative. And not just because my sphincter felt raw and tattered. It was a slow approach to the Moment of Truth, especially when I saw her figure still planted on my sofa. I knew any look on Andrea's face other than her mouth agape would constitute a miraculous victory. And when she smiled at me, the wash of relief that engulfed me was more glorious than any throes of ecstasy I might have wished for at the beginning of the night.
And then I saw it.
The decorative bowl sitting in her lap. Down to just the last few sugarless Gummi bears.
""Du hast Haribo!"" she said to me. Accompanied by a satisfied smile. A big, beaming Hansel and Gretel smile, that slightly turned down in one corner at the sound we both suddenly heard. A low rumble from deep within her GI tract that sounded like Gefahrrrrr.
The German word for Danger.
Her eyes shot past mine and refocused on the bathroom door just down the hall behind me

54,"The faint clatter of dice brought me out of my reverie. I looked around. I was in my bed, in my home. My body felt hot and cold at the same time. A small hand pressed itself to my forehead, cool and soft. I let out an involuntarily moan of relief, as the hand presses my head back into the pillow. Another hand covered my mouth. More hands grasped my wrists and legs and began pulling me down into the mattress. I sank slowly in, the hands firmly holding me, dragging me into the maw of this hellish nightmare.

Another hand struck me across the face, and I sat bolt upright, screaming.

""Jeez ya twinkle fart, calm down!"" Someone yelled beside me. I look around, my eyes frantic and my movements jerking and imprecise. Finally I saw a face, familiar yet alien. My head swam for a moment, double-vision showing me two faces that blended into the one face before me.

""You okay, Max?"" Asked Orvan. ""You were havin' a nightmare, bub!""

My chest was pounding, and my adrenaline was up, but I was starting to calm down from the high. A dream. Maxidian was plagued by night terrors for awhile. I had made the choice to give Max some drama, some depth, in the absence of a well-written backstory. I closed my eyes and pinched the bridge of my nose. Max didn't get over his night terrors until the Red Tower.

I sank back into my pillows, oddly plush for such an out of the way tavern, and looked at Orvan.

""I get... dreams. Bad dreams, most nights."" I looked away and bit my lower lip as Orvan climbed out of his bed and sat on mine. He leaned in close, his face inches from my own. I squeeze my eyes shut and...

""That's rough, buddy."" He says. I groan. Ryan loved that line, and laughed a solid ten minutes after delivering it. Kerry wanted to murder him, of course, but that would come later.

I pulled my shirt on and began to dress. I wasn't getting anymore sleep, tonight, might as well wake up and explore a little. As soon as I had the thought, a pressure I'd been feeling on the back of my eyes released, making me aware of it for the first time. I inhaled a little, the night air cool and crisp from my open window. For the first time since I'd awoken here, I felt like myself. I looked at my hands, and felt my ears. I was still in Max's form, but I felt a sudden sensse of... agency. Like I truly controlled my own destiny.

I looked over at Orvan. He sat where he'd been moments ago, eyes glassy as he stared off into nothing. I snapped my fingers in front of his face, but there was no response. I gave his shoulder a small shove, but he just rocked back into place and remained motionless. The lights were on, but nobody was home.

I pulled my soft-sole boots on and crept to the door, peering out. Nobody was stirring, it seemed. I unlatched the door and slipped out into the hall. The light from the lamp at the top of the stairs was odd, for some reason, and it took several moments of staring at it to realize the issue. The light was steady, as though thrown by a lightbulb, but inside the glass casing was a lit candle. The flame of the candle was perfectly still, not moving at all like a flame should. No responses to gentle sussurations of air current, no guttering and sparking from particularly fatty bits of wax. Nothing. I pondered this for a few moments more, and decided I couldn't do a thing with this piece of information, yet.

I crept down the hall to where I'd seen Tessan enter with Bronnie to be shown where to sleep. I pulled out my tools and carefully... stared at the lock. I looked at my tools, then the lock. Then back to my tools. Then to the lock. I held the tools up to the lock, but nothing happened. Max knew how to pick a lock, of course. Had been doing it since he could recall. Me, though? I had to call in a specialist. Deciding that poking my head in here wasn't that paramount, I chose instead to creep down to the taproom to see if anyone was still awake. The result were mixed. Several folk had their eyes open, and were clearly mid-whisper, but they were frozen in place, unmoving. I walked around to some of them inspecting them carefully. One had a fat purse of coins on his hip, and I gave brief consideration to simply cutting his purse strings. The only thing that stayed my hand for now was that Max had been cash poor, and it was the only reason he'd joined the adventure at all. I was afraid, for now, what would happen if I countermanded that basic call to action.

Several more moments of creeping around told me nothing more than I already knew, so I decided to return to the top of the stairs. As I began to climb, I looked up and noticed that the light was blocked by a figure in a cloak. As soon as I clamped eyes on it, it darted away, back down the hallway. Of course I gave chase. This was currently the only other person moving; I had to know who they were, and why they were also able to move when nobody else was. I stormed the stairs, climbing them two at a time, reaching the landing at the top in mere moments, just in time enough to see the cloak fluttering out the window. I bounded down the hallway, hand outstretched. I couldn't tell you why I didn't call out, but I felt the need for quiet. When I reached the window, I peered into the inky black of the night. There was nothing for it. Whoever it was was gone. I returned to my bedroom after several long minutes, and sat on my bed thinking for the rest of the night.

I still wear nail polish every damn day because... I like it! I don't think men give a damn about nail polish, lol. I think makeup is sort of in the same category except it more directly increases your attractiveness. It's fun, there are so many pretty colors and things you can do... and it makes me feel good. Subconsciously, it makes my heart flutter.

I think for myself I just have that inner desire to feel pretty. I think many women feel the same? But I can only speak for myself. Does it also increase my attractiveness? Ya, it does.

Character isn't what's going to matter in 2020, it'll be policy....and middle America cares more about illegal immigration and the economy then your social issues. I look forward to the great meme war of 2020 and i hope above all hopes its Pedo-Biden on the D-ticket. ",2018-12-28 20:25:17
69,"[](/fluttershh) Right, let's see if I can get my facts right. First of all, common sense: she's lived 18 years of a normal -- presumably pretty alright -- life, only to wake up one day with an incontrovertible, undeniable proof of her world's last Thursdayism and the meaninglessness and triviality of her existence and everybody she ever know and love. While no study has been done on this, I'm willing to bet that that epiphany would fuck up the minds of 100% of the population, and would immediately drive anybody mad or suicidal. As mentioned in iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii.txt and Act 3 iirc, she would've killed herself (citing how easy it was to do) had we not pop up behind the MC's eyes as her very last light of hope. I would also not be surprised by her predisposition to the idea of suicide, since she'd also been shown to try self-harming. By the end of Act 3, when we established that we don't really care for her as much as she does for us, her literally only reason to live is gone, and she resorts to the plan that had always been on her docket and killed herself.",2018-12-29 16:45:00

*How young Morgan had come to be handcuffed in the company of six of his cousins on the side of a country road in the western fringes of Virginia was something of a story, but for the moment, immaterial.  What mattered was that here he was, and he didn't see many ways out of his predicament.  He was running through a variety of plans, and each time, his ideas ran directly into the chromed menace of the Wolverine Security officers pistols.*

&amp;#x200B;

*Meanwhile, the cousin collective conferred on their own in what were, to the drug and alcohol addled minds of the six of them, hushed whispers.  A plan quickly took shape; with only one Sheriff and two deputies, well, if they all split up and just legged it into the dark woods on either side of the highway, at least half of them would get away, and that meant half the bail money they'd have to beg from an uncle.   Three, two, one...    and the cousins all bolted, knees knocking as they fled into the moon draped night.  A meshbacked cap with a logo for Chinchilla Chow Chorizo emblazoned in brilliant greens and reds fluttered to the ground behind the departing gaggle of elves as the Law took off in hot pursuit.*

*The young man who would eventually become Cavalier, meanwhile, remained where he was, still handcuffed next to the Wolverine Security cruiser.  He counted to thirty, making sure that the pursuers and the pursued had both gotten far enough away before he stood up, leaned against the squad car, and with a modicum of finagling and finesse, lifted a set of archaic keys from the dash of the vehicle.  Unlocking a pair of handcuffs behind your back is dicey, sure, but the prospect of spending the weekend in lockup focuses the mind tremendously.  With a clattering clank, the disreputable young elf was freed of his bonds, and shortly thereafter, was loping silently out into the dark, down the road, headed home.*

73,"Third prototype of China's C919 jet completes first test flight

BEIJING (Reuters) - A third prototype of Chinas home-built C919 narrowbody passenger jet completed its first test flight on Friday, its manufacturer said, in another step forward in the nations push to become a global civil aerospace player.

The C919, which will compete with Boeing Cos (BA.N) 737 and the Airbus SE (AIR.PA) A320, is widely regarded as a symbol of Chinas civil aerospace ambition and President Xi Jinpings policy of upgrading manufacturing capabilities.

In a statement on its official microblog, Commercial Aircraft Corp of China Ltd (COMAC) [CMAFC.UL] said the plane landed safely at Shanghai Pudong International Airport at 12:45 p.m. (0445 GMT), having flown for 1 hour and 38 minutes.

The jet will next fly to the city of Xian in central China for more test flights with a focus on aircraft flutter and airspeed calibration, the company said.

The second prototype of the C919 jet conducted its first flight in December 2017, seven months after the maiden flight of the first C919.

COMAC said it is assembling a further three prototypes, and that all six will be scheduled to conduct flight tests next year.

The C919 has dozens of customers that have placed orders and commitments for 815 jets.

COMAC is aiming to obtain certification for the plane from Chinese regulators by the end of 2020, as well as Europes aviation safety regulator, which agreed in April to start the certification process.

The truth of the era of Japan-Korea consolidation
http://www2.biglobe.ne.jp/remnant/rekishi02.htm
 
By KuBo Arisa
 
There was a time when Japan and Korea held hands
and lived along well with each other
 
 
Korea before the annexation of Japan and Korea (1910-1945).
People suffering from hunger and poverty.
[Seoul Namdaemun Avenue in the 1880s (city center)]
Japan rebuilt this Korea.
 
""Japanese were kindness"" heard from parents.

Today, sad rumors flutter in Japan, so many people are misled by it.
For example,
""Japan once invaded Korea, oppressed Korean people, abused them,
exploited, and did terrible things""
It is a kind of rumor. She would have learned it at school. As if it were a fact.
 
It has been taught that Japan is a bad guy. But, whether these claims are true or not,
we have to ask the elders who have actual experience at the time.
 
There is a Korean woman who is  Senhua Ou .
Though she is writing a lot of books on Japanese-Korean relations,
she was told that from the parent's generation,
""Japanese were very kind people"" when I was young.
 
However, when I entered school,
my teacher taught me that ""Japanese have done terrible things to Koreans""
and received a tremendous anti-Japanese education.
 
So, somewhat, while being taught at school,
the recognition that ""Japanese did terrible things to Koreans""
was common sense among her.
 
She later came to Japan and started to live in Japan.
 
Then, the word ""Japanese people were very kind people""
taught by parents once again came back.
 
During the Korea-Japan consolidation era, Seoul in 1936, Namdaemun street.

That's why she studied again about the history of Japan and Korea.
 
Soon she will learn that anti - Japanese education received
in South Korea is very biased and mistaken.
And She came out of anti - Japaneseism.
 
She later published a book called
""The Japanese Governing Era of Consumers"" (Sanko).
This is an interview with the Japanese and Koreans
who actually experienced t
he era when Japan reigned Korea - the era
of Japan-Korea consolidation (1910-1955), and summarized it Thing.
 
There are written testimony of 15 Japanese and Korean
who actually experienced Korea under Japanese rule.
Both of them are quite old people now.
 
They left valuable testimony. Through their experiences,
it is quite clear that what actually happened
in the Japanese occupation era in that Korea.
Let us listen to their testimony.

75,"Anything that is put on an airplane has to go through a lot of engineering of not only the item itself but also how it acts with the whole system itself. You have to make sure there is no flutter or other unwanted responses introduced. 

Airworthiness can be quite a long process depending on what is being added or changed just to get it certified to fly. The ones I work on take up to 2-3 years depending on complexity of change. (Not typical for every change). ",2018-12-31 14:28:09
