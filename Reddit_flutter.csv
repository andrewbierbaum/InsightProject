I've fluttered between the different thinking styles for a couple of weeks now, trying to achieve the ""here and now"" way of thinking and leaving behind the cognitive dissonance. It's hard, but when you achieve it you KNOW it's an advantage because everything is so effortless.

The kind of thinking I'm trying to move away from is what you see in ""Saving Private Ryan"". During the final battle at the bridge, there's this bookworm that has a simple job to do, supply ammo to his buddies behind the machine guns. Because of the cognitive dissonance he stumbles, doesn't have his emotions in order and he becomes a useless mess. He's smart and learned, but he doesn't have focus. In the end he does show some improvement. Everybody stumbles.

Also, from the same article:

&gt;A particularly cruel method of killing was to blind a single bird by sewing its eyes shut using a needle and thread. This bird's feet would be attached to a circular stool at the end of a stick that could be raised five or six feet in the air, then dropped back to the ground. As the bird attempted to land, it would flutter its wings, thus attracting attention to other birds flying overhead. When the flock would land near this decoy bird, nets would trap the birds and the hunters would crush their heads between their thumb and forefinger. This was the origin of the term stool pigeon",2007-04-27 16:34:50

21,"A new poem (well, actually, a remake of an old poem) dedicated to the Hon. Sen. Larry Craig:

Edgar Allan Poe
The Maiden
 
Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered weak and weary,
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,
While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
As of some one gently raping, raping at my chamber stall.
`'Tis some visitor,' I muttered, `raping at my chamber stall -
Only this, and nothing more.'

Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December,
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.
Eagerly I wished the morrow; - vainly I had sought to borrow
From my pants surcease of sorrow - sorrow for the lost Craignor -
For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels named Craignor -
Nameless here for evermore.

And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
Thrilled me - filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;
So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I sat repeating
`'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber stall -
Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber stall; -
This it is, and nothing more,'

Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,
`Officer,' said I, `or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;
But the fact is I was crapping, and so gently you came raping,
And so faintly you came peeking, peeking in my chamber stall,
That I scarce was sure I heard you' - here I opened wide the stall; -
Darkness there, and nothing more.

Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,
Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before
But the silence was unbroken, and the darkness gave no token,
And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, `Craignor!'
This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, `Craignor!'
Merely this and nothing more.

Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,
Soon again I heard a raping somewhat louder than before.
`Surely,' said I, `surely that is something at my window lattice;
Let me see then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore -
Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore; -
'Tis the wind and nothing more!'

Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,
In there stepped a stately maiden of the saintly days of yore.
Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;
But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber stall -
Perched upon a bust of Phallus just above my chamber stall -
Perched, and sat, and nothing more.

Then this ebony gal beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,
By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance he wore,
`Though thy breast be shorn and shaven, thou,' I said, `art sure no maiden.
Ghastly grim and ancient maiden wandering from the nightly shore -
Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!'
Quoth the maiden, `Give me more.'

Much I marveled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,
Though its answer little meaning - little relevancy bore;
For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being
Ever yet was blessed with seeing gal above his chamber stall -
Man or beast above the sculptured bust above his chamber stall,
With such name as `Give me more.'

But the maiden, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only,
That one phrase, as if his soul in that one phrase he did outpour.
Nothing further then he uttered - not a pinkie then he fluttered -
Till I scarcely more than muttered `Other friends have flown before -
On the morrow will he leave me, as my hopes have flown before.'
Then the maiden said, `Give me more.'

Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,
`Doubtless,' said I, `what it utters is its only stock and store,
Caught from some unhappy master whom unhealthful disaster
Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore -
Till the dirges of his hope that melancholy burden bore
Of ""Give me  give me more.""'

But the raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling,
Straight I wheeled a padded seat in front of gal and bust and door;
Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking
Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous gal of yore -
What this grim, ungainly, gaunt, and ominous gal of yore
Meant in croaking `Give me more.'

This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing
To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;
This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining
On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o'er,
But whose velvet violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o'er,
He shall press, ah, more and more!

Then, me thought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer
Swung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tiled floor.
`Wretch,' I cried, `thy God hath lent thee - by these angels he has sent thee
Respite - respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Craignor!
Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe, and forget this lost Craignor!'
Quoth the maiden, `Give me more.'

`Prophet!' said I, `thing of evil! - prophet still, if fowl or devil! -
Whether tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,
Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted -
On this home by horror haunted - tell me truly, I implore -
Is there - is there balm in Gilead? - tell me - tell me, I implore!'
Quoth the maiden, `Give me more.'

`Prophet!' said I, `thing of evil! - prophet still, if fowl or devil!
By that Heaven that bends above us - by that God we both adore -
Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant prison,
It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels named Craignor -
Clasp a rare and radiant maiden, whom the angels named Craignor?'
Quoth the maiden, `Give me more.'

`Be that word our sign of parting, love or fiend!' I shrieked upstarting -
`Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore!
Leave no finger print as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!
Leave my loneliness unbroken! - quit the bust above my stall!
Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my stall!'
Quoth the maiden, `Give me more.'

And the maiden, never flirting, still is sitting, still is sitting
On the pallid bust of Phallus just above my chamber stall;
And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,
And the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;
And my card from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor
Shall be lifted - nevermore!

24,"Preface: Yes I RTFA and started writing this and it became fun. Quite a bit of pentup anger. Hope you RTFC (read the fucking comment)

I just really dislike Friedman. His writing style is sophomoric and his topics are either painfully obvious or over simplified to fit into his own box of poor understanding. He tries to hop on the bandwagon after it already has plenty of steam, trying to explain the issue anew with shitty catch phrases. I couldn't stand his books for over saturation of flawed metaphors. He searches for a 'schtick' and then pounds it over the reader's head over and over until it contorts to a state where it could seep in and make sense (which requires presupposition and imagination). 

Like this article. Ignoring the fact that the Onion said in its subtle satirical way everything Friedman will fumble with, his 'schtick' once again doesn't make sense. 
We all know what he is trying to say, 'don't keep putting your voters in fear, instead lead us into a Plan for a New American Century'. He just fails at saying it. Our real problems started on 9/12, and the weeks that followed, when Bush and Co. introduced the response to the 9/11, the response that would become foreign policy: a 'war on terror' and 'with us or against us'. It was everything I was hoping, with bated breath, he wouldn't say following the attacks. The whole world was supporting us and he pissed it away. 
So my point, Friedman is saying he wants 9/12. It was on that day and the speeches that followed that our recent path was cemented. His article should be about the war on terror,   which wasn't spawned on 9/11 but on 9/12, and is as winnable, as David Cross notes, as a war on jealousy. 

""War on terror"" isn't mentioned anywhere in the article, because as usual Friedman doesn't say much of anything, instead resorting to language and catchphrases that makes my eyebrow twitch. 

Why do you suppose does Friedman ignore the pink elephant-of-a-statement that has essentially become political discourse? 

Well lets see:
He says But we also need our old habits and sense of openness."" Those are really old habits now, as this article and political stance is about 5 years late for Friedman. During those years [he was all about preaching new habits](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Friedman#Terrorism), undoubting rereading Star Wars novellas fervently searching for a new Global Metaphor Paradigm. He was a big supporter of the Iraq war and war on terrorism (including censorship), a term he didnt hesitate to use in his other articles. 
[Here is his wikipedia page.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Friedman#Terrorism)

Then the brilliant scribe continues:
""Yes, in the wake of 9/11, we need new precautions, new barriers. followed by witty sarcasm Give me your tired, your poor and your fingerprints. Again what exactly is Friedman providing insight on? 

But the words my dear, oh the words! How they ravage me. 
I dont know if you read his books, his blog is very similar. Friedman is only genuinely happy when he is consuming things, writing about consumption, or trying to make people consume even more in our country of debt. His books are beacons for our consumerism society. It sickens me. 

It doesnt take long until Friedman pops the brand word, probably because he gets a boner every time he types it. Here is the memo, USA new slogan effective immediately: Where anything is possible for anybody. 
What happened to the barriers and precautions? What does that slogan even mean? Arghhh it makes no sense. It doesnt mean anything. I hate him for saying it and for branding the nation like the business man he wishes he was. 

He then says that he wont vote for a candidate that is not committed to dismantling Guantanamo Bay. Admirable, if you dont read the reasons he gives to WHY it should be dismantled. It isnt about the torture, the suspension of habeas corpus, creating a new legal entity enemy combatant which any Larry Craig could fuck and no one could do anything about it, or the method of choosing who is an enemy combatant, where people are thrown in to meet quotas, wrong place at wrong time, by someone who doesnt like them in Pakistani govt, or because you look at solider in the wrong way halfway around the world. No, it is because tourists to our degenerating country think that is where they will go if they answer incorrectly on entrance questionnaires. It all makes sense now, especially for Friedman, who uses X-ray camp as a segway to talk about the real travesty of this fear rhetoric: loss of business in tourism. 

Because like giving an entire country a brand gives him a boner, decrease in business makes Friedman very limp and confused. Dollars are fluttering away and he will do anything to make them come back, hell even close Guatanamo! 'That will make them come back' he schemes. I cant think of a worse reason to do so. It shouldnt have been built in the first place, and should be shut down for a lot better reasons then to get into the tourist wallet.

But for people who didnt read RTFA these are actual sentences he says:
newest software development center in Vancouver. Thats in Canada, folks.
If Disney World can remain an open, welcoming place, with increased but invisible security, why cant America?
It is like flying from the Jetsons to the Flintstones.
Those who dont visit us, dont know us.

From the phrase we need 9/12  Friedman is supporting the war on terror and everything Dubya has done with it, like he had done for the past 6 years. I am not an apologist for Islamic fundamentalists, but enabling them with Bush's rhetoric fueled policies and consequential actions (i.e. Iraq) was not the way to handle it, and further inflamed their cause. As I have expected of Friedman, he is trying to get on a bandwagon that can do without him, especially since he is trying to jump on it from the war on terror bandwagon that is going the other way. 9/11 didnt make us stupid, you condescending prick, and it didnt even make you stupid. You were stupid all along and didnt give a moments pause to think critically before following the other stupid guy into the hellish political atmosphere where we are now.

31,"&gt;Like most Atheists, Stubbingwicke was all tough talk, but deep inside he was weak since he did not have the Love of Christ to succor him and give him strength. His cynicism and disbelief proved no match for my Faith and I eventually had him on the defensive. As my fists found their mark as if by Divine guidance, he finally fell to the ground on all fours, too tired and beaten to give any more fight. I stayed my fists and stood over his pathetic, subdued form. More curious than angry, I asked him what he hoped to accomplish by killing the Apatosaurus. His reply, snarled from a bleeding cut lip, was as shocking as it was plausible, and I can still remember it verbatim:

Also, from the same article:

&gt;A particularly cruel method of killing was to blind a single bird by sewing its eyes shut using a needle and thread. This bird's feet would be attached to a circular stool at the end of a stick that could be raised five or six feet in the air, then dropped back to the ground. As the bird attempted to land, it would flutter its wings, thus attracting attention to other birds flying overhead. When the flock would land near this decoy bird, nets would trap the birds and the hunters would crush their heads between their thumb and forefinger. This was the origin of the term stool pigeon",2007-04-27 16:34:50

21,"A new poem (well, actually, a remake of an old poem) dedicated to the Hon. Sen. Larry Craig:

Edgar Allan Poe
The Maiden
 
Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered weak and weary,
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,
While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
As of some one gently raping, raping at my chamber stall.
`'Tis some visitor,' I muttered, `raping at my chamber stall -
Only this, and nothing more.'

Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December,
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.
Eagerly I wished the morrow; - vainly I had sought to borrow
From my pants surcease of sorrow - sorrow for the lost Craignor -
For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels named Craignor -
Nameless here for evermore.

And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
Thrilled me - filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;
So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I sat repeating
`'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber stall -
Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber stall; -
This it is, and nothing more,'

Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,
`Officer,' said I, `or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;
But the fact is I was crapping, and so gently you came raping,
And so faintly you came peeking, peeking in my chamber stall,
That I scarce was sure I heard you' - here I opened wide the stall; -
Darkness there, and nothing more.

Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,
Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before
But the silence was unbroken, and the darkness gave no token,
And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, `Craignor!'
This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, `Craignor!'
Merely this and nothing more.

Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,
Soon again I heard a raping somewhat louder than before.
`Surely,' said I, `surely that is something at my window lattice;
Let me see then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore -
Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore; -
'Tis the wind and nothing more!'

Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,
In there stepped a stately maiden of the saintly days of yore.
Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;
But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber stall -
Perched upon a bust of Phallus just above my chamber stall -
Perched, and sat, and nothing more.

Then this ebony gal beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,
By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance he wore,
`Though thy breast be shorn and shaven, thou,' I said, `art sure no maiden.
Ghastly grim and ancient maiden wandering from the nightly shore -
Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!'
Quoth the maiden, `Give me more.'

Much I marveled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,
Though its answer little meaning - little relevancy bore;
For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being
Ever yet was blessed with seeing gal above his chamber stall -
Man or beast above the sculptured bust above his chamber stall,
With such name as `Give me more.'

But the maiden, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only,
That one phrase, as if his soul in that one phrase he did outpour.
Nothing further then he uttered - not a pinkie then he fluttered -
Till I scarcely more than muttered `Other friends have flown before -
On the morrow will he leave me, as my hopes have flown before.'
Then the maiden said, `Give me more.'

Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,
`Doubtless,' said I, `what it utters is its only stock and store,
Caught from some unhappy master whom unhealthful disaster
Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore -
Till the dirges of his hope that melancholy burden bore
Of ""Give me  give me more.""'

But the raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling,
Straight I wheeled a padded seat in front of gal and bust and door;
Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking
Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous gal of yore -
What this grim, ungainly, gaunt, and ominous gal of yore
Meant in croaking `Give me more.'

This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing
To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;
This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining
On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o'er,
But whose velvet violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o'er,
He shall press, ah, more and more!

Then, me thought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer
Swung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tiled floor.
`Wretch,' I cried, `thy God hath lent thee - by these angels he has sent thee
Respite - respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Craignor!
Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe, and forget this lost Craignor!'
Quoth the maiden, `Give me more.'

`Prophet!' said I, `thing of evil! - prophet still, if fowl or devil! -
Whether tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,
Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted -
On this home by horror haunted - tell me truly, I implore -
Is there - is there balm in Gilead? - tell me - tell me, I implore!'
Quoth the maiden, `Give me more.'

`Prophet!' said I, `thing of evil! - prophet still, if fowl or devil!
By that Heaven that bends above us - by that God we both adore -
Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant prison,
It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels named Craignor -
Clasp a rare and radiant maiden, whom the angels named Craignor?'
Quoth the maiden, `Give me more.'

`Be that word our sign of parting, love or fiend!' I shrieked upstarting -
`Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore!
Leave no finger print as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!
Leave my loneliness unbroken! - quit the bust above my stall!
Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my stall!'
Quoth the maiden, `Give me more.'

And the maiden, never flirting, still is sitting, still is sitting
On the pallid bust of Phallus just above my chamber stall;
And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,
And the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;
And my card from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor
Shall be lifted - nevermore!

24,"Preface: Yes I RTFA and started writing this and it became fun. Quite a bit of pentup anger. Hope you RTFC (read the fucking comment)

I just really dislike Friedman. His writing style is sophomoric and his topics are either painfully obvious or over simplified to fit into his own box of poor understanding. He tries to hop on the bandwagon after it already has plenty of steam, trying to explain the issue anew with shitty catch phrases. I couldn't stand his books for over saturation of flawed metaphors. He searches for a 'schtick' and then pounds it over the reader's head over and over until it contorts to a state where it could seep in and make sense (which requires presupposition and imagination). 

Like this article. Ignoring the fact that the Onion said in its subtle satirical way everything Friedman will fumble with, his 'schtick' once again doesn't make sense. 
We all know what he is trying to say, 'don't keep putting your voters in fear, instead lead us into a Plan for a New American Century'. He just fails at saying it. Our real problems started on 9/12, and the weeks that followed, when Bush and Co. introduced the response to the 9/11, the response that would become foreign policy: a 'war on terror' and 'with us or against us'. It was everything I was hoping, with bated breath, he wouldn't say following the attacks. The whole world was supporting us and he pissed it away. 
So my point, Friedman is saying he wants 9/12. It was on that day and the speeches that followed that our recent path was cemented. His article should be about the war on terror,   which wasn't spawned on 9/11 but on 9/12, and is as winnable, as David Cross notes, as a war on jealousy. 

""War on terror"" isn't mentioned anywhere in the article, because as usual Friedman doesn't say much of anything, instead resorting to language and catchphrases that makes my eyebrow twitch. 

Why do you suppose does Friedman ignore the pink elephant-of-a-statement that has essentially become political discourse? 

Well lets see:
He says But we also need our old habits and sense of openness."" Those are really old habits now, as this article and political stance is about 5 years late for Friedman. During those years [he was all about preaching new habits](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Friedman#Terrorism), undoubting rereading Star Wars novellas fervently searching for a new Global Metaphor Paradigm. He was a big supporter of the Iraq war and war on terrorism (including censorship), a term he didnt hesitate to use in his other articles. 
[Here is his wikipedia page.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Friedman#Terrorism)

Then the brilliant scribe continues:
""Yes, in the wake of 9/11, we need new precautions, new barriers. followed by witty sarcasm Give me your tired, your poor and your fingerprints. Again what exactly is Friedman providing insight on? 

But the words my dear, oh the words! How they ravage me. 
I dont know if you read his books, his blog is very similar. Friedman is only genuinely happy when he is consuming things, writing about consumption, or trying to make people consume even more in our country of debt. His books are beacons for our consumerism society. It sickens me. 

It doesnt take long until Friedman pops the brand word, probably because he gets a boner every time he types it. Here is the memo, USA new slogan effective immediately: Where anything is possible for anybody. 
What happened to the barriers and precautions? What does that slogan even mean? Arghhh it makes no sense. It doesnt mean anything. I hate him for saying it and for branding the nation like the business man he wishes he was. 

He then says that he wont vote for a candidate that is not committed to dismantling Guantanamo Bay. Admirable, if you dont read the reasons he gives to WHY it should be dismantled. It isnt about the torture, the suspension of habeas corpus, creating a new legal entity enemy combatant which any Larry Craig could fuck and no one could do anything about it, or the method of choosing who is an enemy combatant, where people are thrown in to meet quotas, wrong place at wrong time, by someone who doesnt like them in Pakistani govt, or because you look at solider in the wrong way halfway around the world. No, it is because tourists to our degenerating country think that is where they will go if they answer incorrectly on entrance questionnaires. It all makes sense now, especially for Friedman, who uses X-ray camp as a segway to talk about the real travesty of this fear rhetoric: loss of business in tourism. 

Because like giving an entire country a brand gives him a boner, decrease in business makes Friedman very limp and confused. Dollars are fluttering away and he will do anything to make them come back, hell even close Guatanamo! 'That will make them come back' he schemes. I cant think of a worse reason to do so. It shouldnt have been built in the first place, and should be shut down for a lot better reasons then to get into the tourist wallet.

But for people who didnt read RTFA these are actual sentences he says:
newest software development center in Vancouver. Thats in Canada, folks.
If Disney World can remain an open, welcoming place, with increased but invisible security, why cant America?
It is like flying from the Jetsons to the Flintstones.
Those who dont visit us, dont know us.

From the phrase we need 9/12  Friedman is supporting the war on terror and everything Dubya has done with it, like he had done for the past 6 years. I am not an apologist for Islamic fundamentalists, but enabling them with Bush's rhetoric fueled policies and consequential actions (i.e. Iraq) was not the way to handle it, and further inflamed their cause. As I have expected of Friedman, he is trying to get on a bandwagon that can do without him, especially since he is trying to jump on it from the war on terror bandwagon that is going the other way. 9/11 didnt make us stupid, you condescending prick, and it didnt even make you stupid. You were stupid all along and didnt give a moments pause to think critically before following the other stupid guy into the hellish political atmosphere where we are now.

His cynicism and disbelief proved no match for my Faith and I eventually had him on the defensive. As my fists found their mark as if by Divine guidance, he finally fell to the ground on all fours, too tired and beaten to give any more fight.

9,"Linux (at least Ubuntu) likes to call that key ""Super,"" and I use it extensively, as Compiz Fusion, the 3D OpenGL desktop sensibly maps many things to it.

If you have ADD Helper mode on, Super+P toggles that. This mode will always darken everything but the active window to make it easier for someone with an attention deficit to stay focused on their current task.

If you have Benchmark on, Super+F12 toggles a tiny window that displays your FPS (currently getting ~1200FPS on my Nvidia 8800GTS).

I have the ""Autumn"" plugin installed, so Super+F11 makes autumn leaves (sprites changeable to any images - I use PNG for anti-aliased transparency) flutter down over my autumn forest desktop scenery, blowing in the breeze.

If I hold down Super while rolling the wheel mouse, I zoom into the whole desktop in 3D, which makes reading tiny text, or seeing small details in some images better. It also lets me zoom in on embedded Flash videos, making them fill the screen. I can also hit Super+1 through Super+3 to zoom all the way out, in to just the current window, or something like a 2x zoom on the current window, the latter 2 of which always move the zoomed portion to the center of my (currently 3-monitor wide) display.

Super+E puts me in Expo mode, which unfolds my cube of virtual desktops into a wall, and zooms my view back, letting me see them all, and choose with mouse, or arrows which one I want, whereupon it flies back into that one, making it full screen again.

Though I can map pretty much anything to anything, Compiz sets up by default Ctrl+Super+1-3, and Alt+Super+1-3 to 6 different user-customizable commands (which can be anything from shell one-liners, to calls to scripts residing anywhere on the machine, in any installed language).

I can keep selecting windows, hitting Super+S to add the current one to a selection group, which greys it out. Then with all the windows I want selected that way, Super+G will group them, letting me move them all around together, and before or after that, Super+T will collapse them all to a single window. All but one will then be visible, and Super+arrow keys will let me switch through them, with the window spinning around, and stretching in 3D to reveal it's backside, which is always the next/previous window. I can also roll the mouse over the title bar to pop up a bar of thumbs of all the grouped windows, and clicking one will spin the window around to reveal that one. Super+U ungroups the window, sending them all flying back out to their previous locations.

Super+N will make the contents of any window draw in their negative colors. I've actually used this often in Firefox to see what the negative image someone's using as a background image, or header design actually is, or because I don't feel like reading white text on a black background. Super+M will do this to all windows, and the panel bars, with Super+N able to toggle it back off for any after that, though this is less useful.

If you have Opacify on, Super+O will toggle it's effect, which is to make any window you hover over reveal itself. It does this by making all other windows fade to almost 100% transparent. You only need to hover over a tiny, unobscured piece of a window to make this happen, which can be useful if looking back and forth between a lot of open windows stacked up in a cascade.

Super+Tab is a sexier version of Alt+Tab (with larger, sexier, live (e.g. playing video if it's of a window with video playing) versions of actual images of the windows themselves, the latter of which works just as it does on Windows. Super+Tab's version moves them a lot more like the 'flipping through CD covers' effect made so popular by the iPhone (here called ""Ring Switcher""). And of course, adding Shift reverses the flip direction. Adding Alt adds in the windows from all other workspaces (virtual desktops).

If I hold Super, and left-mouse drag over anything on the screen, it makes a tinted-purple marquee select box. When I let go, it drops a screencap of that rectangle onto my desktop. It turns out this is phenomenally useful.

And this small slice of all that's possible - leaving out the endless configurability even in just what's already been mentioned - is all a big part of why I love Compiz Fusion. Wait... is that what we were talking about?",2008-02-10 20:00:30

17,"Wii Video Games Blamed For Rise In Effeminate Violence


WASHINGTONConcerned parents are again blasting the Nintendo Wii for an incident of effeminate violence following a 13-year-old boy's limp-wristed attack on three of his classmates at a Cleveland-area middle school Tuesday.

The incidentthe sixth of its kind in as many monthshas left parents searching for answers and struggling to comprehend the dainty assault, which left the necks of two sweaters severely stretched out and countless fingers stubbed.
Enlarge Image Wii

Despite graphic simulated violence against teensy little bunnies and realistic depictions of dangerous plungers, video game Rayman Raving Rabbids is popular among children as old as 18.

""These games are a prissy little menace to our society,"" said Linda Roberts, 35, a mother of three and founder of the group Parents Against Wii, which is suing Nintendo for $52 million in damages from two recent swattings. ""One of these days, the red marks on our children's arms might not just go away after five minutes.""

The Wii, now the most popular gaming system in the country, most recently came under fire last month, when 15-year-old Los Angeles student Brian Strickland, who reportedly plays Wii Sports tennis, was expelled for flicking his wrist back and forth at a fellow sophomore's head. And in January, 12-year-old Boulder, CO native Andrew Conner, a fan of the WarioWare: Smooth Moves game, was hospitalized after swinging his arm like an elephant trunk into members of the eighth-grade boys basketball team.

""The Nintendo company is knowingly exposing our children to disturbing acts of foppishness right in our living rooms,"" said Roberts of PAW. ""Even more frightening, the motion-sensing technology teaches them that the only way to resolve conflicts is to flail their arms in acts of fruity aggression.""

Wii's critics claim that the sissified games use disturbing pastel imagery, graphic representations of adorable characters, and disorienting kaleidoscopes of color to prey on children's basest flaming instincts. The game Dewy's Adventure, in which children control a cute droplet of water who must return fruit to a magical tree, is often cited as one of the worst offenders.

""Three years ago, our children were not prancing after their peers and brutally flicking each other on the playground,"" Roberts said. ""They were well-behaved wimps who spent their recess periods hiding from bullies. What are these terrible games doing to our country's sallies?""

While no scientific link has ever been established, a report to be released by PAW later this month indicates an alarming correlation between Wii's growing popularity and a shocking 200-percent increase in wuss-on-wuss violence. In addition, the group documented 634 incidents of fussy skirmishes, all of which ended in tears.

According to the American Psychological Association, prolonged exposure to cutesy video-game violence can increase aggressive frolicking and angry fluttering in children. Paula Greer, co-chair of the APA Committee on Violence in Video Games and Interactive Media, warned that Wii games reward players for explosive girly behavior rather than enforcing proper negative social consequences.

""The Wii's fluffy flowers and bright peach-colored sunlight glorify chasing precious talking rabbits with plungers,"" Greer said. ""What kind of message is that sending to our children? That it's 'cool' to act like some kind of electrical elf or banana fairy?""

The APA is working with the Entertainment Software Rating Board to update its rating system to reflect the perceived influence of Wii on children's behavior. According to suggested guidelines, games that contain insipid language, vigorous paint scrubbing, and mild to moderate bell-ringing will be rated P for Pansy; those that include simulated sand-pouring and intense lily-pad racing will be rated NP for Namby-Pamby.

But some believe critics of the Wii are overreacting. Benjamin Warren, a First Amendment lawyer based in New York, defended the video game manufacturer, claiming it alone did not invent priggish hostility.

""Limp-wristed flapping has been around for as long as children have had wrists,"" Warren said. ""Our society has always blamed whatever new trend comes along, be it windmills, knitting, the harpsichord, or Jazzercise.""

18,"Seems only vaguely related to programming, but most people have not thought through what they mean when they call something 'art' or an 'art form.'  That is, to answer this question, you first need a theory of what makes something a work of art to which you can apply the properties of video games.  Most people just have an instinct that is not articulated. To know if a video game could qualify there are lots of questions we might ask:

* must something be intended to be art by its creator for it to be art?  How does this work with collaborative efforts?

* must something have a meaning, or embody a meaning to be art?  

* must the art establishment accept something as art for it to be art?  

If we're just talking about something being pretty or visually pleasing or engaging or elegant...well, Duchamp was poo-pooing the 'retinal flutter' a long time ago and the history of modern art has borne out his idea that art and aesthetics are totally separate things(*pace* Kant).",2008-03-27 00:20:39

WHENEVER Richard Cory went down town,   
  We people on the pavement looked at him:   
He was a gentleman from sole to crown,   
  Clean favored, and imperially slim.   
   
And he was always quietly arrayed,
And he was always human when he talked;
But still he fluttered pulses when he said, ""Good-morning,"" and he glittered when he walked.   
   
And he was richyes, richer than a king,   
And admirably schooled in every grace:
In fine, we thought that he was everything   
To make us wish that we were in his place.   
   
So on we worked, and waited for the light,
And went without the meat, and cursed the bread;   
And Richard Cory, one calm summer night,
Went home and put a bullet through his head.

43,"What's happening here is:

(a) Political tribes take care of their own.  The fight between Obama and Clinton, and the associated theater of that fight, is over.

(b) The whole Obama mystique is that he's a gentleman.  This fuels that public image.  ""How sporting of him to step up and try to help his opponent.""

(c) His campaign people will probably find ways to use the Clintons in the campaign where she was stronger, such as with blue collar workers in some states.  So it's a little quid pro quo and back-scratching.

(d) Political constituencies think they are part of the process and that they matter more than the herded cows they actually are, so this appeal to them to help Hillary out makes  campaign donors feel like they're part of the Party (passing the plate around).  If that sounds a little perverse, it is.

Incidentally, I am supporting Obama in this campaign so none of the above should be taken as a slag on him - this is simply the reality of US politics, which is 100% theater, and theater is what Americans want.  

There is a famous anecdote about a 1960 Nixon-Kennedy debate.  Those listening on the radio felt that Nixon had won.  Those watching on television thought Kennedy had one.  On TV, Nixon looked a little haggard from the campaign trail, with a half day's beard growth and a rumpled suit.  In other words, Kennedy won on television because he looked better.

Likewise, this is why you have Clinton supporters who claim to hate Obama and will vote for McCain (even though Obama is maybe 15% different than Clinton ideologically while McCain is more like 75%), or people who make sweeping hateful statements about one candidate but get their little hearts aflutter about the other.

It is 100% theater and stage acting, and has been for generations now.  Contrary to what they say, this is what people want.  People want to feel like they can have a beer and shoot the shit with their candidate.  They want to believe they're ""one of us.""

They're not of course - they're the ruling class.  And they will pat us on the head and say ""how cute"" while taking our money and thanking us oh-so-sincerely.

There is no realistic alternative at present.  I actually switched my party affiliation to vote for Ron Paul in the primaries.  I didn't seriously expect him to win or even make a strong showing, but I hoped that enough numbers voting for him would maybe cause a little electoral fear in the Republicans.  Whether it did will remain to be seen when the vote is tallied in November, because I have a hard time believing most Ron Paul fans will have the intenstinal fortitude to vote for an authoritarian like McCain.

Of the two candidates, I hope Obama wins.  I am voting for him because I think he is competent - because he will be smart enough to surround himself by academics and intellectuals, because he'll want to know more than the big picture.  I don't think he's a saint or walks on water.  He may be a son of a bitch for all I know but at this point even basic baseline competence would be a step forward for the presidency.",2008-06-25 15:54:05

 First one is argument of authority. We are all glad you did entomology field work.

 The correct way to say the picture is a fake would be to point at artifacts revealing fakeness.

 As an aside, if this picture was guaranteed to be genuine, then it would be considered *fact*. Something which you would now  have to integrate into your (scientific) model of what these butterflies do (i.e. you would have to try and understand why they congregate like this). The reason I say this is because fact trumps model. You can not prove that this picture is fake by saying that it doesn't jive with your model of reality. All you have done by saying that is that this picture disproves *your* model unless this picture is proven to be fake.

""Greenspan's Warning

The clear gravity of the situation pushed the legislation forward. Some might say the current mess couldn't be foreseen, yet in 2005 Alan Greenspan told Congress how urgent it was for it to act in the clearest possible terms: If Fannie and Freddie ``continue to grow, continue to have the low capital that they have, continue to engage in the dynamic hedging of their portfolios, which they need to do for interest rate risk aversion, they potentially create ever-growing potential systemic risk down the road,'' he said. ``We are placing the total financial system of the future at a substantial risk.''

What happened next was extraordinary. For the first time in history, a serious Fannie and Freddie reform bill was passed by the Senate Banking Committee. The bill gave a regulator power to crack down, and would have required the companies to eliminate their investments in risky assets.

Different World

If that bill had become law, then the world today would be different. In 2005, 2006 and 2007, a blizzard of terrible mortgage paper fluttered out of the Fannie and Freddie clouds, burying many of our oldest and most venerable institutions. Without their checkbooks keeping the market liquid and buying up excess supply, the market would likely have not existed.

But the bill didn't become law, for a simple reason: Democrats opposed it on a party-line vote in the committee, signaling that this would be a partisan issue. Republicans, tied in knots by the tight Democratic opposition, couldn't even get the Senate to vote on the matter. ""

They can't nail her for ruling over her own daughter like a fucking fascist, forcing a marriage neither person wants, forcing her daughter to carry a baby to term for nothing more than her own political career.  All of these things should repulse the American people from voting for this bitter control-freak hockey-mom.  Her kind are destroying this nation, raising armies of emotionally and intellectually crippled morons with militant overparenting and the idea that those bold enough to be authoritarian leaders have a Machiavellian right to assert that power over the ignorant masses who wander, unthinking, in search of a master to chain them.

Racism isn't their reason for opposing Obama, but you can rest assured that their ignorance is so very deep that they believe lashing out with it in full force is an entirely valid option if he threatens their pet fascist.  He needs to go after McCain.  They are much less enthusiastic for that lich.  With him, Obama can MAYBE, if he can appear stronger than McCain (the ignorant still-children that were overparented into a lack of intellectual capacity seek only a bright flame to flutter to), lead them to regrettably drop their intent to vote for McCain.  Obama needs to attack McCains age.  He needs to seem strong, virile, and fast and make McCain look like the half-dead absent-minded bitter old fool that he is.

83,"Metamorphosis is an animation recently created by the distinguished digital artist Glenn Marshall. A number of people have posted glowing reviews about the film, many of which have consisted of brief two-or-three sentence, superficial comments about Metamorphosis that simply say it's beautiful, or it's a beautiful vision. 

Much to the contrary, ""Metamorphosis"" is totally plotless, yet strangely at the same time it's emotionally very painful to watch. Painful because if one is really thoughtful about this short-film, its stylish graphic design that disguises a dark underlying theme soon falls away. That concealed message is revealed to be a stark requiem of anger and death. The film evolved from Marshalls earlier obsession with butterfly wing patterns as imaginary worlds of life unto death. 

In Marshalls own metamorphosis in creating this new animation-noir, he ended up forging a mythical, shadowy world in which seemingly boundless masses of butterflies appear to be trapped in suffocating confinement, eventually flittering and fluttering aimlessly away into a darkened cosmic void, into a state of non-existence. In a way, Metamorphosis turns Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds on its head, as it evolves into a horror film with victimized butterflies. 

Confronted with this painful animation-noir, I recalled something that Carl Sagan, the astronomer, educator, author (Cosmos, 1980) and Co-Founder of The Planetary Society once said: We are all like butterflies who flutter for a day and think it is forever.

I've done some reading on Serotonin Syndrome and there is a fair amount there that rings true, especially over-reactive reflexes, which I still find I have even ten days on (a cat jumping out, or a friend opening the door to my house, for example will have me really jump, whereas normally I'm a very unflutterable person). It seems possible to me that my personal chemical physiology had a serotonin syndrome reaction to either the MDMA and/or whatever it was cut with.

I'm glad that the prognosis for the syndrome appears to be positive. 

I'm concerned mostly because after ten days surely I have metabolised (or indeed vomited) whatever it was that produced such a bad reaction in the first place. So the remaining symptoms of headache and dizziness is presumably (I'm guessing) a residual chemical imbalance or physical damage from neurotoxicity.

I'm not a raver, but do like to try new drugs in safe settings for the life-experience, and record my experience for 'science' if you will. It seems that this time preparation didn't help. 

On the positive side, the nausea seems to have abated, and I appear to have all my faculties about me, my reaction times are good, my concentration seems fine (perhaps even a little improved). It's just a constant sensation of vertigo and mild headache, but there is a sense that these are just beginning to slowly abate day by day also.

Yes, there are stories of people getting complicated or expensive treatments done here in the US instead of at home. That's because the US is still the world leader in technology*.

That technology isn't going anywhere, and even if we get socialized medicine, people who can afford it will still be able to get cutting-edge treatment here in the US. But the vast majority of the population does _not_ get brain cancer. The ailments that really affect the overall health and productivity of the population are much more mundane: hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, etc. These are things that are poorly addressed by our current system, which emphasizes intervention instead of prevention. Our insurance system discourages people from getting regular checkups so problems can be caught and addressed early, and instead encourages them to do without health care until the problem becomes too big for that to be possible. At that point, the insurance system is hit with the huge costs of treating advanced-stage diseases.

Blinking can also indicate rapport, and people who are connected often blink at the same rate. Someone who is listening carefully to you is more likely to blink when you pause (keeping eyes open to watch everything you say).

That floats on high o'er vales and hills,
When all at once I saw a crowd,
A host, of golden daffodils;
Beside the lake, beneath the trees,
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.

Continuous as the stars that shine
And twinkle on the milky way,
They stretched in never-ending line
Along the margin of a bay: 

Ten thousand saw I at a glance,
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.

The waves beside them danced; but they
Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:
A poet could not but be gay,
In such a jocund company:
I gazed - and gazed - but little thought
What wealth the show to me had brought:

For oft, when on my couch I lie
In vacant or in pensive mood,
They flash upon that inward eye
Which is the bliss of solitude;
And then my heart with pleasure fills,
And dances with the daffodils.

104,"The Raven:  Edgar Allan Poe (1845)

Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered weak and weary,
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,
While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
`'Tis some visitor,' I muttered, `tapping at my chamber door -
Only this, and nothing more.'

Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December,
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.
Eagerly I wished the morrow; - vainly I had sought to borrow
From my books surcease of sorrow - sorrow for the lost Lenore -
For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels named Lenore -
Nameless here for evermore.

And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
Thrilled me - filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;
So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating
`'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door -
Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door; -
This it is, and nothing more,'

Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,
`Sir,' said I, `or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;
But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,
And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,
That I scarce was sure I heard you' - here I opened wide the door; -
Darkness there, and nothing more.

Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,
Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before
But the silence was unbroken, and the darkness gave no token,
And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, `Lenore!'
This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, `Lenore!'
Merely this and nothing more.

Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,
Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.
`Surely,' said I, `surely that is something at my window lattice;
Let me see then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore -
Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore; -
'Tis the wind and nothing more!'

Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,
In there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore.
Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;
But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door -
Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door -
Perched, and sat, and nothing more.

Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,
By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,
`Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,' I said, `art sure no craven.
Ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the nightly shore -
Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!'
Quoth the raven, `Nevermore.'

Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,
Though its answer little meaning - little relevancy bore;
For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being
Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door -
Bird or beast above the sculptured bust above his chamber door,
With such name as `Nevermore.'

But the raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only,
That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.
Nothing further then he uttered - not a feather then he fluttered -
Till I scarcely more than muttered `Other friends have flown before -
On the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have flown before.'
Then the bird said, `Nevermore.'

Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,
`Doubtless,' said I, `what it utters is its only stock and store,
Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful disaster
Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore -
Till the dirges of his hope that melancholy burden bore
Of ""Never-nevermore.""'

But the raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling,
Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and door;
Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking
Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore -
What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore
Meant in croaking `Nevermore.'

This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing
To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;
This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining
On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o'er,
But whose velvet violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o'er,
She shall press, ah, nevermore!

Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer
Swung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.
`Wretch,' I cried, `thy God hath lent thee - by these angels he has sent thee
Respite - respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore!
Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe, and forget this lost Lenore!'
Quoth the raven, `Nevermore.'

`Prophet!' said I, `thing of evil! - prophet still, if bird or devil! -
Whether tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,
Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted -
On this home by horror haunted - tell me truly, I implore -
Is there - is there balm in Gilead? - tell me - tell me, I implore!'
Quoth the raven, `Nevermore.'

`Prophet!' said I, `thing of evil! - prophet still, if bird or devil!
By that Heaven that bends above us - by that God we both adore -
Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,
It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels named Lenore -
Clasp a rare and radiant maiden, whom the angels named Lenore?'
Quoth the raven, `Nevermore.'

`Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!' I shrieked upstarting -
`Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore!
Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!
Leave my loneliness unbroken! - quit the bust above my door!
Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!'
Quoth the raven, `Nevermore.'

And the raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting
On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;
And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,
And the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;
And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor
Shall be lifted - nevermore!

I played it back in high school at my friends house, where he showed me the awesomeness of the game's character creation. When making their character a player would pick a race from a [delightful array of choices](http://www.terra-arcanum.com/index.php?section=library&amp;content=general&amp;id=races), assign points to [basic attributes](http://www.terra-arcanum.com/index.php?section=council&amp;content=general&amp;id=character) (Strength, Intelligence, Dexterity, Perception, etc.), pick their 1337 [skills](http://www.terra-arcanum.com/index.php?section=library&amp;content=characterbank&amp;id=skills), and get the privilege of selecting a [background](http://www.terra-arcanum.com/index.php?section=library&amp;content=characterbank&amp;id=bios) for their new creation.

Additionally, since you would get different reactions not only for being stupid but also for being naked, we sold his entire inventory before the game started. From the very first conversation with an NPC, epic lulz occurred. From then on, I decided to continue the legacy of ""Jungie Bobo"" in every CRPG I played. Upon completion of the main campaign in Fallout 3 I was determined to replay the epic quest with Jungie Bobo as the hero. I edited my last character upon leaving the vault to avoid wading though the dull intro. Excitement and glee poured out of my orifices as I ran to Megaton. I darted inside and fluttered towards the sheriff with bubbles of anticipation inside my soul... However, much to my dismay, the world of Fallout 3 is not a Jungie-Bobo-friendly world and my soul feels as if it has been crushed ten thousand times by the foot of a Super Mutant Behemoth.",2008-11-09 20:28:52

Whether or not CRA played a part in this crisis, how can you not see that deregulation and allowing the markets to be ""free"" are more to blame?

The shareholders didn't do anything, the CEO's didn't do anything and the SEC with their deregulated policies didn't do anything to be morally or ethically bound by principles to avoid this mess. They were not bound by CRA - it only helped them be more devilish in their business dealings.

I especially like Ann Wroe's comments: ""I would rather live off the land than beg...Id do picking work from season to season  the repetitive, soothing, outdoor work Ive always loved..."". Sorry, honey, harvesting is not soothing. It's hard and harsh and pays nearly nothing, and if you're working for food, you'll never be able to leave, because you'd get just enough food to survive and work and the thought of being hungry is terrifying. You wouldn't have a bag of cheese and apples and lembas, your sunbleached hair fluttering in the breeze. You'd be dirty and tired. I've done it. It's not fun.

 ""The long-term plan would involve an uninhabited shack in a small valley by the sea..."" All the seafront property is owned by the rich. Maybe it'll be Chinese bankers, who are not famed for their tolerant attitude towards those who pursue alternative, sustainable lifestyles like yours. If you aren't one of them, they'll call the cops to kick you out of your hovel. Yes, they will, even if you're doing no harm. ""Eventually there might be power and plumbing there, a wood stove, and broadband. "" 

No. Not gonna happen. Wood stoves are expensive. Power and plumbing companies, as well as ISPs, would consider you homeless, and therefore bereft of a billing address. And even if you somehow do manage to build and keep a shack by the sea, it had better be in southern California or Florida; have you ever seen spit freeze into ice before it falls to the ground?

In the ""worst case"", these people, and most of us reading this, are going to be squashed together with friends and relatives into smaller houses, all together. The houses will be cold, and you won't buy new things. It will be very rare for you to have as much food as you want; also, if you have children, you'll often skip meals so they can have more. You'll try to find work, any work - so you're spot-on there, Ms. Wroe, but it won't be as a wandering poet (you are correct in saying most wandering poets were men. So are most schizophrenics and outcasts). Your creative urges will sublimate into finding new ways to cook carrots and onions without expensive spices from other countries.

119,"Secrets to girl porn:

The guy is perfect.

The two are often ""fated"" to be together. Translation: There's no way he's going to leave to be with someone better.

The relationship just happens without the girl having to do any real work.

There is no real conflict that can't be resolved by the guy being really sorry about something.

The guy loves the girl no matter how annoying she is.

There's always just enough angst to be interesting, but not so much that the girl actually winds up fulfilled at the end of things.

There's always some bit in the book about body image, and about how it's OK to be a little different. This bit is usually about as subtle as a brick to the face, just so the dimmer readers don't miss it.

There must always be at least one stereotypically beautiful female character in the book who gets pwned somehow. Either she gets turned down flat by the hunky guy in front of the fugly main character, or she winds up being rejected by everyone at the end.

Sex is always awesome. There's no mess. There's no awkwardness. There's no sweaty grossness. Bodies always have a ""sheen"" of ""excitement."" There's no weird fumbling for condoms or questions like, ""So... um. Are you sure that's just a rash? It really looks like a herpes outbreak."" (Oh, and no one ever, EVER, farts during sex. It just doesn't happen.)

Everyone loves the female character, or most people hate her. If most people hate her, it's the awesome gorgeous guy who stands by her side defending her. If most everyone loves here, there must be at least one character, usually female, usually highly attractive, usually after ""the main man"" who hates her guts.

And yes, I have read romance novels. Albeit for comedic reasons.

The line that cracked me up the most was (paraphrasing here):

131,"Stay away from alcohol.  It'll make you twisted.  The first time I did shrooms, I was already drunk.  A friend and I split an 8th of purple-streaked boomers, and we tripped *balls* for over 8 hours.  I threw up about an hour after taking the shrooms, so I tripped even harder than my friend did.  No idea why puking intensifies the trip, but it does.


Get some C-Monsters or some orange juice, and sip on it for a few hours before you take the shrooms.


The one thing that always gets me about shrooms is that they seem to take forever to kick in.  So if you dose and are still feeling normal an hour to an hour and a half later, don't stress it, and don't worry about the shrooms not working.   Do not eat more.   Even small amounts will give you a body high, and the more you take, the more visual the tip becomes.  When the shrooms first start to kick in, you'll have a fluttery stomach, followed by a sensation that I can only describe as brain-tickle.  You know how if you smoke really good weed in the morning, you'll have that stoned feeling creeping across your head?  That's kinda what it's like.  It's not scary, but it's an unusual sensation.  30 minutes into it, and you'll be grinning like a fool ( and will continue to do so until you come down).  You will actually smile so much that your face will be sore the next day.  Let yourself laugh like an idiot; don't try to control your trip.  Just flow with it, and you'll have a much better time.


Shrooms aren't like acid.  You'll get a great body high, and you'll see some trails and cool colors and shit, but you won't start seeing Jesus and having bugs crawl out of your skin or anything like that.  You can still have a bad trip, but it's more of an emotional thing, rather than visual.  Solid shapes will bend and be moving constantly.  The best trip I ever had was at the top of a mountain.  I just looked across the massive amounts of trees on all sides of me and watched the wind turn the foliage into smiling faces while silver and gold sparks shot through the sky above them.


Make sure you and your friends are comfortable.  Stay far away from mirrors and cats.  Never, ever, ever play Aphex Twin.  If one person starts to freak out, then it'll kill the trip for everyone else, so be sure that the people you trip with are free from major emotional or mental problems.  If someone does begin to freak, it's important that you calm them down, and not freak out yourself.  Quiet talking and light touching will help someone having a bad trip to relax.  The key to taking shrooms is to be calm and peaceful.  You're ready to explore your mind, so if you battle against the effects, you'll find that your trip really is no fun.


Tripping outdoors is 10x better than tripping inside, go run around in the woods, or walk the beach if you live near an ocean or large body of water.  Cloud-watching is a blast.  Shrooms really are the best ""become one with nature"" drugs out there.  If you stay indoors, play chill music, get some glowsticks and other funky glowing toys to play with, and just relax.  Don't try to fight the effects, just roll with it.


Get gum/pacifiers to combat the mouth-clench, and perhaps a valium/xanax in case someone starts tripping too hard.  Your trip will last 6 - 8 hours, and you'll peak around hour 4 or 5.  If you are coming down and smoke a bowl, you'll shoot right back into the trip again.


I hope this helps.  There's nothing quite like shrooms, and it's one of those drugs that will (if you allow it) change your perspective and outlook on things.  It wasn't anything life-changing for me, but there is definitely a pre-shrooms *quit_complaining* and a post-shrooms *quit_complaining*.


Finally, remember to trip in moderation.  If you have the best time of your life while high, you'll want to trip again (which is fine).  Just be sure to wait a bit and ground yourself in reality before taking off again.

Crack, I fell in love with you, with your filthy voidness.

Certain logistical facts have been altered, on the off chance a cop will stumble across this Erowid account and come bust those crack dealers who were always treated us with respect and easy kindness even though we were obviously outsiders, radiaingtly white, green, young and inexperienced honky kids in Camden, driving the shittest car in the worldin a decrepit neighborhood, the kind that always makes me want to write poems about the wretched tricks God played on men.

It only ever took 20 minutes to pick up crack -- a quick run down a highway, that special exit I can't pass anymore without cringing, and desiring. They were always there, waiting on Hyacinth St., hands perpetually in pockets, faces impssibley young, bare brown incision lines of chest hinted at as their wifebeaters fluttered. They always had dimebags, hidden either in their gums, or in a secret box concealed in trashy woods strangled between rowhomes. An exit, a left, and you were on Hyacinth Street. We used to go about twice a week, buy the rock, buy a crackpipe for a dollar at 711 or shady Mid Eastern run convencience stores, the copper filters at the dollar store. They were right across the street from each other. If you had twelve bucks and a car you could smoke crack any hour of the day.

This is how it was, how we came to fall in love with such filthy fragmented opaque flames:

Wistful waverings of whitehot afternoon, sultry silhouettes stark. They smelled us as we wafted in on the freeway currents; we stank subtly of guttings, of peroxide holes, imperfectly constructed skeleton savior dreams. They lounged in the loud luster of blank sun that baked the bricks and asphalt and the tangled vermillion agony of lonely trees, wild ivy and long grass reeking green in thick stripes between slumping townhouses, whose walls had absorbed a stricken procession of foster faces, deadbeat halfsmiles. They saw you, smelled all the cultivated bruises pouring out of your watchful face, then they would sink into the trash-tinselled trees, the leaves would close curtly behind them; or they would spit quickly, deftly into their pale palms; the ritual of bringing forth small pale rocks, cradled in skinlike red or blue or brown plastic, sometimes yellow plastic, never clear plastic. The wrinkle-wrung faces of grandmothers would shift over our plastic ivory-plated faces through the open spaces of our rolled-down windows; we'd shrink away sweating in shame. The grandmothers held the shadows between their teeth; they were the granmas of the boys with their hands perpetually in their pockets, the boys who brought us over with specific whistles, mystic motions to let us know. To let us know.

Crack, crack, buying crack, wanting crack, laughing out great bursts of cracksmoke, holding in the hits of crack, letting the disconnected sockets and bleak breakers surge in swoops of smoke fresh from my lungs, I loved each gust of crack curling in cold clouds within the chamber of my chest, tiny white slivers and pebbles of crack, the numb gutter weight of crack, hovering holy in heavings and the heavy hot sky, laughing at us for wanting such dull stars, crack crowding the slits in the sidewalk, a piece of crack for every hole in my heart.

They draped themselves over porches and leaned coolly against streetlights and tree trunks, lines of sweat glazing the brown achings of their faces. We would flash fingers at them, one or two or four or six; the bills already in slender folds, pressed into the underside of our hands, undercover in pockets, against the shake of leg. The freeway bleeds into Hyacinth St., where white is the color of wanting, Corona leaving clouds in their mouths, we smoked more cigarettes than they ever did, and hid in the smoke. When rain came to christen their concrete stretches they stood under dark umbrellas, measuring the vibrations of the avenue with their eyes. Sometimes blunts dangled from the corners of their sunstuffed lips, smelter-smiles of smoke-slidings curling up into the curd of clouds. bleached through with aluminum streamers of August sunshed, held together with bricks, a fellahin swapshop of human souls that called out in magnetic offerings, called all of us there, to sweat shards in a filthy fever exchange. Tiny white fragments through thin, colored plastic. Fractional fadings of the lean street would come to infect some pulsing place buried in the gristle spectrums of our intellect; we would be drawn from the exhaust and imploded smoothness of our own streets, into the car and onto the slick run of the highway.

Then because we were long we'd drive around the nieghborhood, the nieghboring townships, taking turns steerin for whoever wsas sucking the glass dick'; we made endless circles around suburban developments, passing the crackpipe back and forth bteween us, simply becuase we had no other place to go.

Crack: I belive crack to be an insiduous drug. If evil could have a physical form, crack would be it. The bliss when you suck in a good hit and hold it in is indescribable -- bliss, joy, euphoria, cool numb ecstasy sweeping through your body; it begins in your lungs and radiates outwards, filling you fully with an absolution, a swooning poisoned sweetness, uncomplicatedand delicious.

The high lasts about 5 minutes. If that. It's the best feeling you ever felt, followed immediately by the worst you've every felt -- it's impossible to describe a comedown from crack. Suddenly the world is void, empty, hopeless, depressing and gray beyond words; everyone annoys you, you hate yourself and everything, and after you've smoked all your stash, you begin to ghostbust -- see pebbles, pieces of lint, that you think is crack. It never is.

I've spent hours of my life holding crackpipes up to lamps to see if there is any residue left to smoke. I sold most of my movies for crack -- everytime I go to look for a good movie I see they're all gone, and I say 'What the hell!' then I remember I sold them all that month I was into crack . . .

I've spent evenings alone with my crackpipe in supermarket parking lots; I've smoked so much my face and hands and feet have gone numb and my body shaked uncontrollably and my heart was deafening in my ears

However, I do not regreat a single moment of my involvement in the crack life for a while; I learned many things, and I feel proud that I was able to smoke crack more than 20 times and was able to stop fully.

As I took the water-pipe away from my lips and puffed up my chest, holding in the poison, I was experiencing a paralysis taking hold. Tyler intercepted the bong and lighter as I tried in vain to reach them to the table in front of us. As I blew out my lungs as heartily as I could, I perceived a lightness rising quickly in my mind and senses.

Oh, I uttered, Thats interesting.

My vision was starting to blur in digital patterns. My left eye first perceived that a vertical line of pixels in the center of my vision, extending from top to bottom, began to extend itself outward to my left. So were the colors of my living room obscured into a latitude of approximated information for the left side of my vision, while my right eye still beheld the t.v. case, the game systems, the dark window, and my observing roommate.

Ok. Alright. Oh man. Ohhhhh Jeez

As the last of my vision slipped away I became panicked. The moment from my childlike astonishment of the sensual obscurity to the next is not accountable, because my world had suddenly left me, and I found it now featureless.

I heard what can be described as static. I saw, through a colorless shade, the vague impressions of recognizable objects lingering on my periphery.

Whats going on?

Its cool, man, my roommate would later be heard on the video, trying to comfort me.

Dude! Whats going on? My words came out like a sputtering engine as I yelled through my paralyzed confusion, and sounded on the recording as a polite request instead of a panicked yell.

Its cool, man.

I tried to move my body, writhing, suspended, and barely visible as a speck of motion through the gray dimensions. Tyler watched me stamp on the ground and feel for my knees. My main perception was that I had caused some tear through all fabric of our cosmos. I identified in my view a scrap of reality, all dimensions fluttering and torn, wavering near my reach. I crawled my presence toward the fringe, vainly clinging to the burst reality which Id known, slain, and autopsied. It looked like a farce- one too horrible to be true though which I knew was; the zipped seam of my universe had been thoughtlessly opened apart. As I had hold to the last images of reality in my mind, the plane of limbo was falling into further chaos. My feet and legs began slipping over the high waterfall of my purgatory and falling black from grey.

My book-bag sat over the arm of the sofa by whose side I writhed. Its presence was the most prominent remembrance in my mind of my previous blissful consciousness. I bemoaned my carelessness; Id exploited a crack in realitys shell, and scratching it had fissured up the uneasy depth of eternity into my view.

I would be seen crawling slowly and ineffectually up on the armrest of our couch, wailing and grabbing at the top of my book-bag while Tyler looked on with an expression of laughter paused for horror. My screams have been described repeatedly as shrieks. Indeed, their short durations filled the air and the recording with melancholy, and all my composure was grief.

In as unexpectedly a pass as had it gone, my vision came returned. The gray static that lies behind my immediate perceptions was again cloaked up by the flapping whimsy of our world.

Are you kidding me?

My predicament dawned on me and I was left naked on Gods stage, speaking directly to Him and wondering if my limbo had really been a necessary joke for Him to play.

No, Tyler tried his sympathies.

What I dont know whats going on, I squeezed my head and pressed my shod feet against the carpet, Are you fucking kidding me?

I settled back into the living room, looking toward the book-bag with a confused sense of object-worth as I remembered how its presence had been the only scrap of memory that had kept itself in my view all throughout the journey.",2008-12-23 08:08:56

137,"At 2:50, with his parents out of the house as he'd planned, and ten minutes before the time they'd arranged, a breathless Elizabeth appeared at the door. Tom could tell from the burning intensity in her eyes that she had had as frustrating a morning as he had.

He quickly invited her inside and took her jacket, drinking in her scent and aching to touch the soft skin around her neck. They headed upstairs to the office, which had been doubling as a spare room for Tom. Despite the passion coursing in their bodies, things were still awkward between Tom and Elizabeth: hookups are never as simple as porn films. Instead, they sat down and actually started to work on her physics problems, with snatched glances flashing from one to the other, for what seemed like forever.

Finally, as he reached for her text book, Tom brushed his hand along Elizabeth's thigh. ""Oh, sorry"", he said. ""It's OK"", she replied, with a meaningfully intense look. They paused, while they enjoyed the loaded, musky silence that always precedes a first kiss.

As their lips met, Tom's hands dove straight for the body he'd been dreaming about for nearly 24 hours. His left hand cupped the perfect ass perched on the edge of her chair, while his right hand gently went to her face, touching her skin just under her ear. Her girly scent creeped into his nostrils, and he focussed on the electric current surging between his lips and his cock.

Elizabeth was slow to respond. Tom pulled back to check she was OK, to see her still leant forward, hands on her lap, eyes closed and mouth slightly open. After a couple of seconds, her dusky eyes fluttered open and she stammered, ""I've... I've not done this before..."". His conscience urged him to stop: could he take the virginity of a girl ten years his junior? Elizabeth sensed his dilemma, but instead of trying to convince him to continue, she simply slid her hand across and lightly felt the shape of his cock, her eyes growing wide with surprise as she felt it twitch under her touch.

They stood in unison, and he pulled her tight red sweater over her head. With every extra inch of tanned skin exposed, Tom's excitement doubled so that when her top lay on the floor, he could barely stop himself from ripping off the rest of the clothes that instant. In fact, he made a grab at her breasts, but her self-consciousness finally won, and she caught his hands, putting them behind his back and them holding them there with one arm while she unbuttoned his shirt with the other, demanding that he undress at the same rate as her.

She caught her breath as his tanned, lean torso was exposed. He mentally thanked himself for the good diet he'd been sticking to while on holiday over the past couple of weeks, and the lunchtime breaks soaking up the sun, giving his skin a healthy golden color. She glanced up at him, a good 8"" shorter than him, as if to check she was doing OK, and Tom merely had to nod down towards the now obvious tent in his jeans. She knew what to do - virgin, yes, but innocent? No.

She unbuttoned his jeans and pulled down his boxers just enough for his swollen dick to jump out with such force that it made Elizabeth jump. His guess was that she'd only seen porn in photos, never see a real, moving, erect, pulsing cock before; either live or on film.

Still, she didn't hesitate to guide his dick into her mouth, unsure at first, licking and nibbling like you might treat a lollipop. She continued as he reached down her back and unclipped her bra with one hand, a cheesy trick which only impresses the most vacuous girls, but that really comes in handy when you've got a 15 year-old sucking your cock - her first cock - and you don't want anything to break the rhythm.

With some gentle suggestions, Elizabeth quickly got the hand of sucking dick, and had one hand purposefully stroking the shaft while she used the whole flat of her rough tongue to massage the underside of his uncut dick, as the head bumped into her tonsils, making her gag slightly and helping her produce gooey lubricating spit.

The sight of her picture perfect face being penetrated by his by now fully erect dick was almost too much for Tom, especially with those pert little breasts jiggling around with every bob of her head.

He picked Elizabeth up underneath the arms and bodily threw her onto the bed, where she landed and bounced with a little whimper and a giggle.

As he kicked off his trousers, Elizabeth was starting to unbutton her jeans with a look of great uncertainty. ""Wait, I'll do that"", ordered Tom, and Elizabeth relaxed, happy to watch his body flex and move as he peeled off his socks and climbed onto the bed with her.

With each button he popped open, Tom breathed in deeply, unsure whether the growing musky smell was because he was getting closer to the underage pussy in front of him, or just that Elizabeth was getting more and more turned on. To prolong the delicious delay he carefully undid each and every button, then slowly slid the tight jeans off her hips, down her legs and off her feet.

She was wearing sheer, purple colored, low cut panties through which he could easily see a tuft of pubic hair, and a inch-wide damp spot right over her pussy. She closed her bent legs together, turned her head to one side and giggled. Embarrassed at having a stranger, a man, an older man looking at her most intimate parts. To reassure her, he lay down beside her, gently lifted her hair and kissed from the nape of her neck round to her ear lobe: a trick he'd learnt a few years ago that would melt any girl having second thoughts. Elizabeth had clearly never been touched like this before, and out of the corner of his eye he could see her nipple start to puff and harden, while her legs, though still closed, twisted and ground together, obviously aching for attention.

He shifted close to her and gently caressed her inner thigh while their lips locked together and she made whimpering noises. She wasn't experienced enough to reach for his cock, but Tom was fine with that as he was pretty sure that even an accidental touch right now might be enough to send him over the edge, immediately.",2008-12-26 23:53:39

Take a braced biplane wing in which the wires ""begin to sing"" right around 200 mph (which is just a fancy layman's way of saying that the cable under goes harmonic flutter).  Flutter is not something that is normally associated with cables, but when you hit the right speed it happens.

Next consider the fact that a 1/16th of an inch cable has roughly the same drag as a laminar flow airfoil cross section with modestly high wing loading.  Now scale that up to the thickness required for a space elevator cable.  I would expect air density differences in the lower atmosphere to produce a tremendous wave (that was characterized in the simulation) but in the opposite direction.  In fact, I would expect this wave to continuously destroy the cable from the tip down as the air density differential repeatedly regenerates the wave over and over.",2009-01-06 16:38:17

No gentleman doth deny.

When a fair maiden strolls in with a diminutive waist

And a bustle in your face...

You approach a mutual acquaintance who may introduce her to you, and after a respectful introduction you politely inquire her father whether or not you may be allowed to make calls upon said young lady, and should he acquiesce, you make a series of chaperoned calls at the estate of said fair maiden, and after an appropriate time, during which you have reviewed her trainings, breeding, accomplishments, likelyhood to produce healthy offspring, and family standing, you approach her father again, and if he agrees to the marriage, you have an elaborate wedding, making sure lest you snub any family connections on either side, after which you embark on an appropriate honeymoon during which you get sprung.


You become distracted from your affairs when you notice the pleasurable silhouette of a young woman with a bustle,

It lies beneath many layers of fabric, and you find yourself utterly engaged in examining it from afar.


Oh, darling, I would like to escort you on outings

And commission an oil portrait of you

My fellow gentlemen attempt to dissuade me,

But your bustle imparts within me feelings of great ecstasy.


Oh yes, that wire frame

Would you like to ride in my hansom?

Then join me, I beg you to join me

For you are more accomplished and pleasing to look upon than an average young lady

I have observed you at dancing

And I fear my love for you will scarcely bear a long courtship

I perspire greatly

As a racehorse will in the midst of the steeplechase


I tire of these leisurely publications

Advocating the abandonment of the bustle--

If you were to inquire as to the opinions of gentlemen of standing on this matter, you would find that they greatly prefer the current fashion.


Therefore, ladies...

Milord?

Miladies...

Milord?

If you do wish to ride in my luxurious carriage...

Indeed, milord!


So, your betrothed owns a carriage of Japanese make

and engages in calesthenics instructed by Lady Jane Fonda?

But Miss Fonda has no motor in the rear of her carriage!

I, and by extension my membrum virilis, which I shall liken unto a ferocious and large snake, am not interested in the performance of the sacred marital duties, unless the Creator has endowed you with a voluptuous form pleasing to the baser instincts of man, dear heart.


Various rapscallions make pretentions of being noble

And admonish that thy bustle is akin in size to the fretful hippopotamus

So they make pantywaisted pretense for your affections before fleeing from romantic commitment

But I am swift to mend thy bruisd fluttering heart

These periodicals of the printing press state that it is in good Parisian style to resemble a victim of consumption


Fie!


Thy shape resembleth a glass of sweet wine

So to the waifish guttersnipes I proclaim:

Thou'rt not divine, onion-headed lasses!

Rather introduce me to a lady of the court,

One of such striking beauty that I am smitten by her glory

And whose curves show that she lacks for neither nourishment nor health

Some blatherskytes speak ill of women in my company

For their tongues are sharpened by jealousy

They squandered their one opportunity with such damsels by acting the churl

And I fly to the scorned and praise their beauty

So if thy bustle is elliptical

And thy womanly fires burn hungrily for one to stoke the flames

Please see my man Godwin for my card

And do call on Sunday for tea.",2009-01-26 03:24:04

It was only one engine short of the B-52 as well, having the curious arrangement of six pulling on the wing leading edge and one pushing at the rear.

The K-7's very brief first flight showed up instability and serious vibration caused by the airframe resonating with the engine frequency. The solution to this 'flutter' was thought to be to shorten and strengthen the tail booms, little being known then about the natural frequencies of structures and their response to vibration. On the 11th flight, during a speed test, the port tailboom vibrated, fractured, jammed the elevator and caused the giant aircraft to plough into the ground, killing 15.

Undaunted by this disaster, Kalinin's team began construction of two further K-7s in a new factory, but the vicissitudes of Stalin's Russia saw the project abandoned, and in 1938 the arrest and execution of Kalinin on trumped up espionage and sabotage charges.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibanez_Edge :

Ibanez Edge Zero

The Ibanez Edge Zero, first installed in the 2008 RG Prestige line and Ibanez E-Gen, has a removable stop-bar/secondary spring, known as Zero Point System (carried over from the Ibanez ZR tremolo), that provides additional spring tension and thus extreme tuning stability; at the cost of a stiffer feel and being unable to 'flutter' or 'gargle' like other fully floating systems. in all marketing material, Ibanez have claimed that due to the ZPS, unlike other locking tremolos, even with a string break, the other strings can still stay in tune at an acceptable level. In actuality, anyone who has owned a ZR tremolo can attest this is not the case.

The difference between Edge Zero and ZR Trems is that ZR trems use ball-bearings for pivots, while the Edge uses the traditional knife edge. Over the course of playing, a knife edge may dull, resulting in declining tuning stability (although it takes a few years for knife edges to dull enough to cause a problem, and they can be sharpened fairly easily).",2009-02-07 00:14:31

See here: http://www.moonconnection.com/moon_landing_hoax.phtml

Under 'The Fluttering Flag' they say that,

&gt;However, **experts, in an attempt to defend the landing against the moon landing hoax theory explained that a vacuum has no friction. On the moon things don't stop moving as quickly** as they do on Earth, so when the astronauts got the flag attached to the surface and straightened, it stayed there longer than what we are accustomed to

Emphasis mine, ok, so the moon is close to being a vacuum hence the flag keeps fluttering (I've heard more credible explanations which are verifiable through experiment as to the reason why the flag fluttered, but that's besides the point).

Then we have this under 'Driving the Rover'

&gt;There were no clouds of dust rinsing from the tires of the Rover because moon dust returns directly to the surface.

Wait, the dust returns directly to the surface? What happened to all that talk of the flag fluttering because of a lack of friction and it being a total vacuum? Surely a lot of the dust from the surface would be kicked off by the tires, I mean the force of those wheels weren't exactly weak now where they?

I mean sure, we can argue it being a total vacuum the dust would fall back to the ground a lot faster however they would also be kicked back a lot further by the tires.",2009-02-08 05:40:28

36,"&gt;I don't see why that should be the case at all. We make snap judgments all the time. A book like Malcolm Gladwell's Blink is a perfect illustration of that.

Sorry, you're right. I shouldn't say ""rational deliberation"" but just simply ""deliberation"".

Moral judgments are only moral judgments when there has been deliberation followed by a conclusion leading to possible action/inaction.

&gt;I disagree. I'd say it among the first order of moral judgments, necessary before any more acute moral judgment is possible.

No. That makes no sense. How can you call the immediate sensation of ""empathy"" moral judgment in any meaningful sense of the word? We must distinguish between a concept of empathy in the reflexive sense and the reflective sense. I speak of reflexive empathy which is instantaneous and occurs when you see another individual and their emotions are mirrored in your own mind (through mirror neurons in the parietal lobe of the physical brain). This sets off a resonance of emotions/thoughts that ultimately become your ""intuitive thoughts"". Deliberation does occur and this can be physically proven by activity in the pre-frontal lobe but the activity only runs across the ""low systems"" of the brain and you don't catch these thoughts so easily.

Your notion of moral judgment is profoundly inadequate. You have reduced and picked away at ""moral judgment"" to the point where your ""heap of sand"" is but a ""single grain of rock"" and you point to it, say ""LOOK! Moral judgment"". Don't be so absurd, my friend.

&gt;&gt;But how do you recognize a moral situation?

You've been tossing these ""how"" and ""why"" words around and clearly they are your favorite philosophical tools in your box. I am pressed to ask: What do you mean by ""how"" and what do you mean by ""why""?

""How"" as in ""what method and rational procedure allows for XXX occur?""? I would point out that when you ask ""how"", there are limitations to the type of answers you will get back. 

""Why"" as in ""for what purpose and intention is XXX occurring""? The same applies.

The Socratic method isn't perfect and it has limitations to the type of knowledge it reveals and furthermore, it has may dangerous implications.

To answer your actual question, I point to the mirror neurons in your brain and the parietal lobe. They register activity concerning empathy and such before my conscious mind even realizes there is a moral situation. It's amazing but it's true. 

&gt;You seem to suggest two answers. One is that certain emotions are triggered (instinctually?);

Yes.

&gt;the other, that any social context is a de facto moral situation. If it's the latter, we're still left with the question of how to judge the sort of moral situation we're in -- 

So you seem to have acknowledged the fact that moral recognition alone is insufficient for moral judgment? Or is your single grain of sand considered a pile of sand?

&gt;How do we know what moral considerations to bring to bear? 

The capacity for moral deliberation should come naturally to any human individual by the simple fact that we are social animals since the formation of our species. When thinking about moral situations, we focus on intention, consequences, the five W's (who,what,when, why, how), personal principles, social norms and in recent times, we think about our own emotions (in a meta-cognitive manner) and virtues. That is simply the ""how"" in the general sense but how you do this ""well"" or in a ""good/skillful"" manner is simply a matter of practice.

If you asked ""How does Da Vinci paint masterpieces?"", you would be told how his painting methods but not necessarily how he painted *""masterpieces""*. How Da Vinci painted masterpieces is simply his own skills, devoid of method that leads itself to imitation and rationalization.

I have a suspicion what you are truly asking is how to paint *""masterpieces""* concerning moral judgments and I doubt there is an answer you will find satisfactory.

&gt;And with the former, the question remains, why are our emotional intuitions a reliable index of the moral circumstance, particularly given that people's emotional responses tend to vary?

They are not a reliable motivator for ethical deliberation at all but that neither here or there. They *are* the motivator for ethical deliberation and we can only hope the moral judge we are observing has cultivated his emotional intuitions properly.

We had a minimum level of responsibility to be ethical, if not for ethics sake but because our intuitions are prone to fault and thus need rational calibration.

&gt;how can we trust our own emotional intuitions? And it doesn't seem unnecessarily skeptical to me. Then again, I was drawn into philosophy classically, by the Socratic assertion that an unexamined life is not worth living. In fact, that's what most morals seem to do: Draw our instincts and intuitions into question. Should I act from what I'm feeling now, particularly if what I'm feeling is anger, or lust, or jealousy, and so on? But the same considerations can apply to seemingly more benign emotions. Is it right to be empathetic towards a confessed murderer on death row, even if empathy is what I naturally feel? Is it right to give money to a person who I know will use some portion of that money to buy a drug that makes them behave irrationally and erratically? My problem with what you're proposing is that I see no way to really delve into those questions so long as we uncritically trust those emotional intuitions.

I see what you mean but I think you have distracted yourself from the origins of your question. You asked for the basis for moral judgment and the conclusion is that they rested in our emotions and arguably, other factors. Whether emotional intuitions are inadequate is an entirely different thing. I think you are too black and white about whether to trust or not trust emotional intuitions.

You can trust your emotions if you cultivate them (Aristotle called them ""rational desires"") but you can't trust your emotions if you leave them unrefined and indulge them whenever you want (irrational desires).

If you feel empathic towards a murderer, nobody can stop you or hold you morally responsible for such an emotion. You can certainly hold yourself responsible and you can definitely say *""Hey, I shouldn't feel this way. I need to rationalize these things""* but on what basis you make that decision is entirely up to you. You can certainly rationalize all your emotions and you should but you can't do this all the time. Over rationalization of any idea will only drive you to insanity. You will end up becoming absent of emotions and incredibly indecisive. The point is to cultivate your emotions so they are rational and when you think they are within reason, you return to your biased emotional self until further notice (either by some tragic moral event or the infuriating probing from some stranger on Reddit &lt;3).

&gt;So does that mean all action have a moral content? 

They certainly have the potential to be moral situations.

&gt;If so, how do we determine what that moral content is? How do we reconcile all of the moral demands placed on us. And so on, and so forth.

You are misguided in your focus. Remember the butterfly effect? The flutter of a butterfly wing that can cause a hurricane across the world?

You are spending too much time thinking about all the possible hurricanes you could cause as a moral agent and you're being crushed by the burden of your over-responsibility. You forget you're just a butterfly, a single human being and you aren't the only single cause for that potential moral situation. Paying for a single horror movie certainly contributes to the desensitization of young people to violence but you can seek comfort in the fact that there is an entire industry that is also to blame. If the desensitization of the youth is morally grotesque to you, I suppose you do have much reason not to see the movie...I personally don't care that much. Additionally, I am fully aware of the immorality of the meat industry but I still happily eat the harvested flesh of slaughtered bovine slaves. Call me immoral, I dare you.

You are right, we are morally responsible for alot of things and any absolutely ethical person would find much reason to drive himself into life as a hermit...I'm not really willing to go that distance yet.

If you're not willing to do that, how do you figure out when and what is an appropriate moral situation to fret about? Ah! This is the Art of Ethics, indeed and not something that can be taught.

At some point you should appeal to pragmatism and give yourself a break. Stop the philosophizing and just say ""fuck it, I'm only human"" and seek shelter in the the amoral bubble of diffused responsibility.

&gt;I think most people would say that any situation can be made immoral, but that not all situations are inherently moral. 

The situation may not be a moral situation but ethical behavior is constant. If you are truly ethical, you are ethical 24/7. You can't be ethical when people are around you and suddenly not ethical when people are not. Virtue Ethics draws our attention to ""being"" ethical as opposed to simply looking at ethics in terms of actions.

&gt;By that rationale, someone with total, or near total, lack of emotional affect would not merely be incapable of judging a moral situation -- they'd literally never be the subject of a moral situation.

Absolutely. People with physical damage to the emotional areas and pre-frontal lobe of the brain are morally absent and/or entirely incapable of making any decisions (which color pen to pick, etc). We never consider them moral agents in any meaningful sense. That is why we don't hold these people blameworthy for their actions and instead, we send them to psychologists/neuroscientists to investigate their brains and minds.

03/06/2009 - Woke up at 9pm after a nap.  All symptoms were gone.  Felt 100% normal.  Sat down to watch a movie.  Had 2 scoops of ice cream about an hour in.  30min later I had to turn the movie off, I felt the symptoms coming back - having trouble looking at the tv, 

3/07/2009 - woke up at 4am, felt light headed, disoriented, dizzy, anxious.  Sat to use computer for awhile.  Right cheek went numb.


Ok I will provide more details and some questions in hopes that you can answer them amd give some more theoretical advice.  Lets pretends this is an exercise.  I wouldn't use this as a substitute for a doctor visit but appreciate the disclaimer nonetheless.  I'm a 27 year old male, with past psych history of OCD, Anxiety. I only recently started getting panic attacks (in the last year and a half).  I've never used any drugs.  I drink rarely (two glasses a year perhaps), and do not smoke.  No known food/medication allergies.  I'm using topical Retin-A cream for acne.  Medical history - clean, except for diagnosis of Sjogren's back in 2007 from a biopsy.  I forgot to tell the hospital about this diagnosis.

In the past an episode has lasted approx~4hours.  Triggers - falling asleep, sleeping (waking up with an attack), worrying, driving, being alone.  Symptoms I've felt with attacks in last few weeks as well as last year: anxiety, light headed/dizziness/vertigo, feeling of impending doom, nausea, feeling of being outside myself, feeling of becoming psychotic/losing control of my mind (like I'm about to become scatterbrained), feeling as if I'm going to have a rush of blood to my brain or a heart attack, tightness in chest, weak grip, tingling sensations in wrists/hands/feet/ankles.  

Additional symptoms that have only occurred in last few weeks - strange sensations on top of head, feeling as if I have to move/wiggle my tongue.

Additional symptoms that occurred Thursday night - hot flash, sudden numbness all over face, burst of anxiety, all while driving.  

Additional symptoms that happened today/last night - sudden rush to my brain of anxiety/adenaline while lying down trying to go to sleep, chills. 

I had a brain MRI in 2004 or 2005 to check for brain tumors (yes I am a hypochondriac, but I have been having brain fog), this was normal.  In 2009 my brain CT scan was normal.  

Back in 2008/05/10, I fainted from having an episode similar to what I'm having now in terms of head sensations.  My EKG came back normal, so did all the tests you mentioned- pituitary, thyroid, liver, kidney, etc. 

One symptom I have had that I thought to be anxiety related is this sort of flutter in my midchest/sternum.  It feels like I skipped a beat, and then I have to cough.  This made me wonder about ruling out Mitral valve prolapse?

When I google sjogren's + panic I get http://www.sjogrensworld.org/tepper.htm.  Glance at this, it says that neuropathy, anxiety, panic, brain fog, loss of sensations, can all be caused by sjogren's and they can be fleeting.  Could this be your neurological zebra?

The CT scan also showed I had enlarged sinus cavity.  Dr gave me antibiotics for sinusitis.  This could have been causing the headaches.  

I've been worried about my brain for the last 4 years.  I have a math degree, and have felt like I have gotten stupider with math and all things.  When I write, I skip letters in the words.  When I read, I read like an ADHD person now and skip lines.  When I try to do simple multiplication, I end up getting stuck in a loop when trying to do something like 25x46 in my head.  My memory also seems to not be that great.  This is why I got the MRI of the brain, but if I really do have sjogren's, couldn't that be stupifying me like those papers say?  I've gone from doing complex mappings and using pde's to describe traffic flow, to getting stuck on simple if/else logic in a java program.  

While I am all for therapy, I have been pretty normal from July `08 to Feb `09.  I did therapy for my anxiety/ocd and learned relaxation techniques.  It's hard to get therapy when your attacks are intermittant. ",2009-03-07 11:11:30

60,"From what I'm reading (and please correct me if I'm wrong) you're arguing that there are two types of belief.  One in which your actions are effected by the belief and one type in which they are not.

We might call these two types of beliefs explicit beliefs and implicit beliefs.  In the cultures both you and I live in a belief that there is no such thing as vampires is most likely implicit.  Meaning we don't think about it much.  We didn't weight our options, seriously consider it, but then decide not to believe it.  We believed it because of other explicit and more important beliefs necessitate it, but we didn't actually ever give it much though, just assumed because the other beliefs already answered that question.  Other implicit beliefs would be that the god Zed, whom neither of us have every heard of, doesn't exist.  These don't really effect your actions because they are so buried within other beliefs that though you specifically do not wear garlic to bed to prevent vampires from breaking in, the cause for that action is not an implicit belief but rather an explicit belief about the possibility of supernatural monsters or whatnot.

So then what's an explicit belief?  I'm assuming from your description something that is a cognitive belief.  All beliefs are intermingled in causality, but explicit beliefs have some weight on their own.  An explicit belief would be your belief that there is no supernatural monsters.  You came to that belief because of many other beliefs, but it's not just an obvious offshoot of other beliefs.  The other beliefs causalities came together to form this belief and this belief has specific effects on your behavior and other beliefs that are different from others.

For instance, you aren't afraid of werewolves attacking you in the middle of the night.  You don't hold open the possibility that a demon could be making the window curtains flutter like that.  It may not seem like this belief is affecting your behavior, but it is.  You're whole worldview is different and your day to day life would be considerably different if you did believe in the supernatural.  So you're belief that there is no supernatural, which you came to by careful thought and consideration (not by just not thinking about it at all), is explicit.

Now then, if we agree in general on all that then it seems like our disagreement is on whether or not atheism or Atheism is explicit or implicit.  I'll say right off that Atheism, as I described in my last post, is explicit.  This is because it involves specific beliefs on the nature of the world and a sense of group unity.  I hope you'd agree with me there.  So hopefully we've narrowed the argument down even further, is atheism explicit or implicit?

Some beliefs can be implicit or explicit given the situation.  In goth communities believing there are no vampires may actually be a much more well defined and central belief to you because most of the people you're surrounded by do believe in vampires.  In certain cases something that is so often just an offshoot of many many other beliefs may actually become a central belief that really does have an impact on you and isn't just implied by many more important beliefs.  In this case a belief that is 99.9% of the time an implicit belief is now an explicit belief.

However, I don't think atheism is ever implicit...or if it can be it's less likely to occur than believing in no vampires being an explicit belief.  This is because believing there isn't enough proof to justify a god has a huge impact in our society and in most areas of the world.  Not to mention it's a fundamental belief about the world that impacts many many other beliefs.  Who you are is different because you don't believe in gods.  How you judge morality (or a belief in no morality) is greatly affected by your belief in no god.  Even if you're not an Atheist you're life is greatly impacted by the belief.

I know it feels good to act like a belief in a god is like a belief in vampires because it's a little insult to those that disagree with you about gods...but it's not true in our culture or most of the world.  Most of the world believe in a god or gods...so you are very specifically different from that.  Most of the world, however, does not believe in vampires.  A belief that there is no vampires would have very little effect in your life not only because it's not really a fundamental belief like atheism (though it's the offshoot of other fundamental beliefs, one of which may be atheism) but because no one really thinks about that belief...however the god debate is a prevalent one around the world.

It's because of this I see atheism as the exact same as theism in the sense of belief.  Just as dogmas based of of atheism such as Atheism and Buddhism (I believe that's based on atheism but haven't done much research on it) are the exact same as dogmas based on theism like Theism, Christianity and Islam.  Does that make atheism less?  I really don't think so.  I'm confused why so many atheists make this such a big deal.  Well, I know part of it...part of it is they want to redefine all these words and change how people think about them so that atheism appears to be the default belief.  Sadly, this isn't the case in this culture and it's kind of a slimy tactic (though I'm sure you didn't mean anything using it, it's become so prevalent many people who argue vehemently for it don't even think about it much).  Unfortunately, it's generally knowledge of science that breeds atheism not ignorance of the world (I'd assume ignorance would be the default since you must learn scientific knowledge).",2009-03-10 14:49:59

A cards doc explained it to me this way: Think of your heartrate increasing and decreasing throughout the day as a car changing gears. Sometimes it doesn't go smoothly and you get that flutter and the subsequent ""oh shit"" feeling. This is fairly common. As it is making this flutter, sometimes the electrical conductivity gets whacked out for a second causing a palpitation. Unless your adrenal gland is having issues, no worries; and if it was, and effecting the electrical processes of the heart, I and fairly promise you would know about it by now, or be completely unaware as you would be a systole. It's probably not a murmur as that is a constant and undetectable without a steth or ECG. However; if your heartrate (also quite unlikely) clicks over into a highly tachycardic rate (around 140bpm and without exertion)and stays there without resolving (VTach) this needs to be addressed by an ER via drugs or cardioversion (shock).

As for it being picked up- It will likely only show up on a 12 lead ecg while it's occurring. If you want definitive proof, you will have to shell out for Holter monitoring. It's  a pager sized device you wear for 24h connected to leads on your chest.

At best I'd bet if you were on an ecg while having one of these palpitations they would pick up a short PRQ interval (every point on the sinus rhythm of an ecg is labeled by a letter, 2/3 into the alphabet is where resolving palp tends to show up) that resolves immediately. It's a scary sensation, I know. the fact that it feels so abnormal and then you get a bit of an adrenaline rush do to your immediate WTF response only makes it seem more horrifying than it is.

73,"&gt; Mental illnesses CAN, however, affect someone's impulse control

First of all, autism/aspergers is in its own class. I wouldn't even call it a mental illness, given that there is a movement among the members of that community - just like there has been in the deaf community - to try to get us to accept it as a normal but unique way to relate to the world.

But overall, I don't agree that mental illness does affect ""impulse control."" One has to first of all define what an impulse is, and I really don't agree with all the theories that certain psychologists have around impulses. Humans have certain needs which help them to be physically healthy - and so they take care of their bodies in certain ways. Humans have certain desires to do things - and they ought to be wise in how they approach the task of fulfilling their goals.

I think that people who live in a rigid structure throughout their childhood and youth tend to act out childishly because they are treated as children - even as they get older. They aren't given the opportunities to socially mature. They don't have a proper adolescence; they don't have the opportunity to learn how to act as an adult among adults. I've seen this more among those with cerebral palsy. Autistic folks seem to have enough opportunities to grow up socially, it seems to me.

The upshot, however, is that if a person is given the role of a child... and all of his decisions are made for him... then that person might very well frequently act out as a child would in that situation - because that person has the same need to manuever around and affect the social politics of the environment in the same way a child would.

Just to touch briefly on another topic to continue what I was saying elsewhere about folks knowing the difference between the world of imagination and the physical world: Certainly, people like schizophrenics are known to act out physically in relation to their imaginary world. They may flutter their eyes, or they may walk in circles. But those actions do not mean that they are oblivious to hazards around them, or ways in which they might cause harm around them.",2009-03-28 04:35:35
74,"&gt; I wouldn't even call it a mental illness, given that there is a movement among the members of that community - just like there has been in the deaf community - to try to get us to accept it as a normal but unique way to relate to the world.

Why? I think the autism community wants to move away from calling it a mental illness because there's a stigma around the term ""mental illness"", but the real problem here is the stigma and not the classification. The stigma of being diagnosed with a mental illness is a separate issue from the very real and true fact that:

&gt;a brain development disorder characterized by impaired social interaction and communication, and by restricted and repetitive behavior

Meets the qualification of 

&gt; a psychological or behavioral pattern that occurs in an individual and is thought to cause distress or disability that is not expected as part of normal development or culture

Granted, I agree that there's no reason to treat the mentally ill with such stigma (it's obviously something they're not capable of controlling), but to try and change the facts simply because the autistic community doesn't enjoy being ostracized because people are unable to cope with the mentally ill is dishonest and simply false. 

&gt; One has to first of all define what an impulse is

Here you are:

&gt;urge: an instinctive motive

&gt;Humans have certain desires to do things - and they ought to be wise in how they approach the task of fulfilling their goals.

Yes, that's exactly my point. Most humans have, at some point in their lives, had a desire to do something inappropriate such as strike another person who's aggravating them. We're largely capable of controlling these desires, because we understand that violence isn't a part of appropriate social interaction. 

That doesn't mean I think all autistic children are ticking time bombs, or that all adults are well-behaved individuals. But it's ignorant and dangerous to assume we shouldn't be more mindful of individuals with a disease characterized by:

&gt; impaired social interaction and communication

Especially in light of the fact that an impaired communicative ability means they're sometimes unable to voice their frustration adequately.

&gt;I think that people who live in a rigid structure throughout their childhood and youth tend to act out childishly because they are treated as children - even as they get older. They aren't given the opportunities to socially mature. They don't have a proper adolescence; they don't have the opportunity to learn how to act as an adult among adults. I've seen this more among those with cerebral palsy. Autistic folks seem to have enough opportunities to grow up socially, it seems to me.

&gt;The upshot, however, is that if a person is given the role of a child... and all of his decisions are made for him... then that person might very well frequently act out as a child would in that situation - because that person has the same need to manuever around and affect the social politics of the environment that a child has.

Yes, there's a well-known sociological theory called ""labeling theory"" describing exactly what you've said here.

That means nothing to the individual who has to deal with an autistic adult, however. In fact, I'm not even arguing with you that society needs to treat the mentally ill differently: we do. There's a large stigma regarding the mentally ill which still persists, and much of society could stand from education regarding mental illnesses.

That doesn't mean we need to whitewash the diagnosis of autism because the public reacts in a negative way that the autistic community doesn't approve of.

&gt; Certainly, people like schizophrenics are known to act out physically in relation to their imaginary world. They may flutter their eyes, or they may walk in circles. But those actions do not mean that they are oblivious to hazards around them, or ways in which they might cause harm around them.

Schizophrenics have an abnormal perception of reality. If your perception is abnormal, you may in fact be incapable of distinguishing between what's real and what's not - especially if your brain function is abnormal. 

I can tell you from personal experience my aunt is a diagnosed schizophrenic who threatened my grandmother with a knife because she believed my grandmother was trying to kill her by poisoning her cereal: this is actually how they came to realize she was suffering from schizophrenia. 

The point of medicine isn't to gloss over facts you find disconcerting or unappealing: it's diagnosis and treatment, even if the treatment is simply learning how to cope with a disease. Society's reaction to that disease should not have even the slightest effect on the medical knowledge regarding that disease.",2009-03-28 05:15:14

Blinking is a neat natural process whereby the eyelids wipe the eyes clean, much as a windscreen wiper on a car.

Blink rate tends to increase when people are thinking more. This can be an indication of lying as the liar has to keep thinking about what they are saying. Realizing this, they may also force their eyes open and appear to stare.

Blinking can also indicate rapport, and people who are connected often blink at the same rate. Someone who is listening carefully to you is more likely to blink when you pause (keeping eyes open to watch everything you say).

Beyond natural random blinking, a single blink can signal surprise that the person does not quite believe what they see ('I'll wipe my eyes clean to better see').

As such, we have a very nice fixed mortgage that we originated in 1999 and refinanced in 2002.

About mid '07 there was, I dunno, just something in the air.  I felt it.  A lot of others felt it.  The writing was on the wall if you were willing to look - prices weren't rising, they were fluttering like a plane about to go into a stall.  And my buddy, with his brand new crackerbox outside of town, started to think that maybe he didn't want to live a half-hour's drive from anywhere.  So I told him

""Look, I don't know for sure, but this stuff can't keep going up.  If you want out of that house, get out of it soon.""

And that's all we talked about it.

Two weeks later he put his house on the market.  I was freaked out - I mean, I talk a mean line but holy shit not even *I* listen to my advice.  But he listed the thing, and three days later four of his neighbors went into forclosure.

My bedroom door was open, and I spotted some movement (a figure?) through the doorway. At this point, having never experienced anything like this, I literally thought I was being abducted by aliens, quite scary. It was pretty difficult to get back to bed that night.

Since then I haven't had such crazy experiences, and kind of knew what to expect the second time really. Both instances lasted for no longer than 1.5 minutes. They felt much longer though, had I not looked at my clock the first time, I would not have been even able to gauge the length.

""Do you have any extra batteries that might fit a digital camera ? "" . 

me: ""Yes, I have some AAs and ..."" - I took out a couple and gave them to her. She clinched both items tightly, but despite that, a bump in the tracks made her drop one of them on the floor. Without waiting I tried to pick up the item and so did she . Our heads bumped. 

""Ouch !"" she said.

""I'm sorry "" I replied and followed by introducing myself by name. As usual, the first four sentences fluttered out quickly and without hesitation, topic ran dry.

After a dozen minutes or so, I hear my mobile ringing and 'Dad' pops on the display. ""Ugh !"" , that was something I had no time for .

Her satisfaction seemed to justify me being on the god awful , boring train ride. A moment of joy in an otherwise blur of a day. I sat down. She seemed very open and showed me some of the pictures. Prague, Vienna and Hamburg were some of the cities I noticed . She nudged my arm. Asked about my opinion and we talked for hours. 

What turned out to be a wonderful afternoon blended into an early night. ""Supper will be served in 15 minutes"" blared the speakers signaling the dinner car was ready for seating.

""Wonderful "" she whispered and asked to join me for a meal. By this moment, we sat close together, our bodies side by side , separating only by the swaying of the train car. The ice was broken. Comfort zones were one and it seemed like a natural progression. 

I said ""Yes , that would be delightful.""

She asked me to watch her personal belongings as she changes into something more comfortable in the far car side, ladies washroom. 

""Wow"" was uttered under my breath as I looked up. Eliza looked stunning in her blue dress, she swore she bought just a few hours prior at the Budapest town square. 

I felt compelled to offer a complement like a chump that I am. 5 seconds pass, I stop myself. A moment of James Bond-like chivalry comes over me and I ensue into a top to bottom stare with a satisfied  smile on my face. She waits. Submissively giving me an opening for a friendly exchange of pleasantries. 

""Ravishing , now you're fit to accompany me for dinner"" I uttered and placed my hand on her side. With a coy smile, she frowned and laughed right after.

[And there goes your original point fluttering out the window](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/8g5s7/a_little_perspective_cdc_estimates_that_an/c0968vm). So now that we've finally gotten you to admit that your age group isn't the only one that matters, what the fuck do you have to argue about? 

Are you seriously going to argue that ""OMGWTF, THIS IS BAD BECAUSE IT AFFECTS *ME* NOW TOO"" even though most of the people who have gotten the swine flu have managed to recover so far? 

While we're on the subject, the one death in the U.S. from the swine flu was of a 2 year old boy in Texas. Does he not matter just because he's 2? Try telling that to his fucking family and see if they agree with you.

The swine flu is statistically not a big deal, you'll live, you'll move on, it's not the end of the world. Stop acting like it is.

EDIT: Even the World Health Organization [has acknowledged that the seasonal flu is worse than the swine flu.](http://www.latimes.com/features/health/la-sci-swine-reality30-2009apr30,0,3606923.story)

Yes you are. And trying to downplay the severity of the seasonal flu won't do anything.

*Know what might actually help them? Acknowledging the severity of potentially pandemic health threats and responding to them accordingly. I don't think you're being a huge whiny vagina is helping anything.*

Know what might actually help them? Not dismissing the fact that thousands of people die from the regular flu every year just because they're very young or very old. Know what might actually help, period? Not feeding into an overhyped media frenzy because you're only concerned about yourself.

96,"I'm afraid you're in territory, now. Think of this as like in prison. Honesty, while all well and good for the priest, does not really work here. Rather, this is the sales pitch by which to procure a date by which to give you some leniency (if things go well after that, then complete freedom) to spill the honest intricacies of your heart. 

In this day and age, you just have to assure her that you're not going to immediately harm her (physically or mentally). Assured of that, she'll probably say ""yes"" because we're social animals who naturally like meeting other people. Like animals, though, we're attracted to people who offer us some security and assurance. If you come off as desperate, then she'll probably think of you as desperate, which she might like if her idea of security is getting a desperate guy to mold. 

By and large, assurance comes from putting her at ease. You know you won't knowingly inflict upon her some pain or displeasure, but make sure she also knows that. In other words GENTLY MANIFEST your honesty. Manifest that you believe her to be stunningly beautiful but don't say it outright, don't flutter your eyelids or stare at her from behind the magazine rack (You: ""peek-a-boo!"" Her: ""ah, ok...""). It sounds difficult, but it's really not. See, if you don't think you're worth it, then things like ""Hello. I love you. Won't you tell me your name?"" come out, and, yes I know that in our limited perception the world seems so finite that a woman at Borders is the end all be all of dating but she's not. I mean, in your seemingly limited perception, at least there's another borders. Sometimes it's good to look at all humanity as being like buffalo herds. 

It's like in the Third Man: in a sea of people, how bad would you feel if one dot stopped moving? So: in a sea of people (billions), how bad would you feel if one dot thought you were a little creepy? In all reality, you can't really lose (unless you have a certain affinity to that borders and cannot handle a person working there who thinks lesser of you) because if it fails, then at least you know what doesn't work. 

Don't worry! Even if you do come off as creepy, then you might as well do it and get it out of your system before the thought police take over and all instances of creepiness are considered potential terrorism.

""Protect the masters."" Owens responded.

""Owens, you have to cut this out... dude, did you just spin all your silk on those assholes?!  You are going to need that!  Shit dude.  Let's go get some leaves in you."" 

""Protect the masters."" Owens said back with the same intonation.

""Dude, that's it, I'm going to go chomp those little fucks."" Burritt said.

Burritt moves in twoards the cocoons.  

""Nooooooo!"" Owens screamed, smashing into his friend again and pushing him from the leaf.  

Burritt fell through the air, spinning end over end twisting and writhing in vain to right himself.

He landed with a thud several feet below.

Burritt looked up, ""WTF dude!?"" he shouted up to Owens, but Owens gave no reply.

Burritt looked around.

_I have to get back up there, talk some sense into him._

A noise in the background startled him.

""Who's there?""  Burritt called out.  

There was no reply.

A faint humming, elusive, distracting, filled the air around him.

""Coward, come out and fight me like a catipillar!""   Burritt called.

The buzzing faded.  Burritt started up the tree again.  Suddenly, a sharp pain filled his back!  Burritt pushed off the tree and spun trying to grab his attacker, but he grasped only air.

The sharp pain filled his back again, and again.  Burritt twisted in agony cursing that he was soft and caterpillar-ly and not hard and beetle-ly.  

And then all was black.

Burritt woke up after an unknown time, confused and dazed.  ""What happened?"" He asked aloud.

""Shit!"" he remembered Owens.

He scrambled up the tree and climbed out onto the limb which his friend was on.  

Owens lay there, twitching.  

""Oh god Owens! Look at yourself.  You need food, we have to get you help.  Some how.  Oh god oh god don't die please don't die."" Dew gathered beneath Burritt's compound eyes.

""Protect the masters"" Owens twitched twoards Burritt, but there was no strength left in him.

""Owens, I'm so sorry, I'm so so sorry, I-"" Burritt was interrupted by the cocoons.

They started to pulse.  Burritt watched in horror as wasps emerged from the cocoons and massaged their new wings.  

His mouth was open, he wanted to scream, but no words would come out, he couldn't move.  

Owens seemed to relax.  ""The masters..."" he whispered in quiet awe, as though finally finding peace.

Burritt looked down at his friend, but then the wasps began to move.  They fluttered their wings and began to fly.  The flew menacingly close to Burritt, but then weirdly, it appeared as if they were suddenly bored, and flew off, leaving Burritt alone with dying Owens.  

As the wasps left, so did Owens.  He curled into a ball, and stopped moving forever.  

Burritt wanted to cry, but he had no tear glands.  

""The bastards.  The fucking bastards!"" he cursed.

Burritt sat there for a long time, unable to cope with everything that had happened.  Many hours passed with Burritt still standing near his fellow caterpillar's corpse, protecting it as he protected them.  A few times he ripped off a bit of leaves and put it near his friend's dead mouth, hoping the emaciated corpse would chew again and everything would be alright. 

Eventually, Burritt gave up.  He left, days passed.  After a while, Burritt started to eat again, to live.  He took things one hour at a time.  Remembering to go through the motions of daily life, though they felt empty and meaningless he still did them.

Then Burritt felt something inside of him move.",2009-05-02 01:07:43

He loved her and she loved him
His kisses sucked out her whole past and future or tried to
He had no other appetite
She bit him she gnawed him she sucked
She wanted him complete inside her
Safe and Sure forever and ever
Their little cries fluttered into the curtains

Her eyes wanted nothing to get away
Her looks nailed down his hands his wrists his elbows
He gripped her hard so that life
Should not drag her from that moment
He wanted all future to cease
He wanted to topple with his arms round her
Or everlasting or whatever there was
Her embrace was an immense press
To print him into her bones
His smiles were the garrets of a fairy place
Where the real world would never come
Her smiles were spider bites
So he would lie still till she felt hungry
His word were occupying armies
Her laughs were an assasin's attempts
His looks were bullets daggers of revenge
Her glances were ghosts in the corner with horrible secrets
His whispers were whips and jackboots
Her kisses were lawyers steadily writing
His caresses were the last hooks of a castaway 
Her love-tricks were the grinding of locks
And their deep cries crawled over the floors
Like an animal dragging a great trap
His promises were the surgeon's gag
Her promises took the top off his skull
She would get a brooch made of it
His vows pulled out all her sinews 
He showed her how to make a love-knot
At the back of her secret drawer
Their screams stuck in the wall
Their heads fell apart into sleep like the two halves
Of a lopped melon, but love is hard to stop

In their entwined sleep they exchanged arms and legs
In their dreams their brains took each other hostage

110,"2010 Olympic torch unveiled
WHISTLER - If every Olympic torch is supposed to say something about the country in which its Games are being held, then the torch for the Vancouver 2010 Games says cold, bright, expansive and snowy.

With a flourish befitting the unveiling of an art sculpture or a long-lost master, the organizers of the Vancouver Games revealed Thursday their concept of what an Olympic torch should be.

Inspired, Vanoc says, ""by both the lines carved into the snow by skiers shushing down mountains and the undulating beauty of the snowy Canadian landscape"", the Vancouver torch is a long white and chrome staff utterly different from the racy blue curve of Turin, the red scroll of Beijing, and even the squat wood chrome cauldron of Calgary.

The first of 12,000 of the ski-shaped torches Vanoc will use in a 106-day, 45,000-kilometre journey across Canada made its debut Whistler's village square.

Two prototypes of the torches made their debut when they were carried by Patricia Moreno and Caleb Taylor down Whistler's main stroll and into the village square.

They had to make their way through a crowd of about 2,000 people, and at one point they stopped in the middle of the crowd as people got their first good look at the metre-long torches.

""Hold them up, hold them up,"" several people shouted at Taylor and Moreno. ""Let us see them.""

Although Bombardier engineers have several working torches that they lit to check their work, these ones were not lit. That honor will take place in late October when the first torch is lit in Olympia, Greece.

Until then, all torches on display around the country remain unlit.

The torch was unveiled with International Olympic Committee president Jacques Rogge, politicians and Vanoc CEO John Furlong present.

Furlong, speaking to the crowd just after the torch was revealed, cradled the torch in his hands and spoke with emotion.

""I look out here and I see the snow trickling down and I think God is smiling on Whistler's face,"" he said. ""I look out at the 2,000 to 3,000 of you out here and I think that is fantastic, and this time next year, one year from today, this 2,000 or 3,000 will become 33 million, all of us united by the power from this torch.""

But the torch wasn't the only item revealed. Vanoc also made public the white, green and blue uniform each torchbearer will wear come the time they run their segment of the relay.

The first two torchbearers named, Moreno, 18, of Vancouver and Taylor, 35, of Regina, modeled the new Hudson's Bay Company-designed uniforms.

The two were selected by Coca-Cola and RBC, the two co-presenting sponsors of the torch relay.

The torch, nearly a metre in length, was designed by Bombardier, the Canadian aerospace and transportation giant. A team of scientists and designers began working on the project in November, 2007. Bombardier presented Vanoc with a concept last April, and received IOC approval in June. The team spent the summer and fall of 2008 developing the mechanics of the burner before laboratory testing in December.

Mike Chambers, president of the Canadian Olympic Committee.

""I saw the prototype of it and just loved it. It is so truly Canadian in its design,"" he said. ""It is hard to imagine that we have just one year to go before the Games. I think this torch will constantly remind us of what is happening here in 2010.""

The design moves away from a traditional cauldron style of flame that other organizing committees have used. Instead, Vanoc says this flame ""will unfurl like a flag fluttering in the wind"" because the torch has a unique 30-centimetre-long vertical flame outlet.

Bombardier's designers incorporated two unique Canadian items; a red maple leaf air intake cut-out that feeds the flame air, and an engraving of the Games motto ""With Glowing Hearts"", along with the French version.

The torch design has already proved a hit with Rogge, who in a prepared statement said it was ""like Canada  young, exciting, innovative, and welcoming to everyone who sees and holds it.

The design of an Olympic Torch is very important, he said. It cradles the Olympic Flame and its message of hope, the celebration of excellence, friendship and respect wherever it travels in the world.""

Bombardier says the torch is made out of stainless steel, aluminum and a sheet moulding compound. It will be assembled in Canada from primarily Canadian resources.

Once the flame is lit in Olympia, Greece in late October, it will be flown to Victoria, the first stop on the cross-Canada tour. It will finish in Vancouver on Feb. 12, 2010.

Rusted steel creaked and groaned as I shifted my weight. My foot finding the petal I gave it a little gas, just enough to hear the high growl of my little death trap. My opponent did the same, I couldn't see his eyes, but I imaging they narrowed at me, his lips spreading into an open mouthed grin, teeth impossibly white gleaming at me like daggers from the cage of his machine.

The flag dropped and we took off simultaneously, as if connected by the same bundle of nerves. Dirt was sprayed behind my buggy in a wide arc, a cloud of dust quickly overtaking me. The visor to my helmet became opaque and my lungs filled with dirt. Soon traction was gained and my vehicle shot forward.

The vibration rattled my teeth, I could here the rapid clicking as they smacked into each other at a fast pace. I glanced out of the side of my roll cage and saw mountains in the distance, and for just a moment the vastness of them gave the illusion I was standing still on the bed of cracked dirt and salt. That illusion was soon broke as one of my tires hit a rut and the buggy was momentarily thrown up and sideways. I hit the ground, fighting with the controls to keep it going in a straight line, sweat falling in rivulets into my eyes, the stinging sensation urging me to lift my hand from the wheel and wipe them.

I heard the whine of my opponents machine over my own. He had a smaller but much faster vehicle. Focusing I could see him racing towards me, his own vehicle looking solid and not at all uneased by the hazardous road we were on.  I gripped the wheel tighter and tighter, even as the grip around my heart became tighter and tighter. My breath came in short gasps. 

Then suddenly, everything slowed. I could hear the wind whistling around the steel bars that made up my roll-cage, I could see rocks souring through the air as they were thrown up by my opponents wheels. My own heart was a thunderous slow drum, telling time as accurately as any Swiss made clock. It was peaceful, it was absolute. 

Darkness flashed out from a blinding light. A crash of steel on steel and then the sudden feeling of weightlessness. The world swimming grey. My stomach sinking as the world rushed up to meet me. Impact. Smell of spilled gas.

The pain was in my chest and sometimes running down my left arm. Sometimes the pain would be sharp and sometimes the pain was dull. There was really no rhyme or reason to the pain. It got so bad one time that I went to the ER and they told me that it was a panic attack. I had never had one before so of course I thought they were full of shit. I KNEW i had a pain. After a few more times i did realize I was having a panic attack but it was the pain that was what was triggering it. They told me my mind was making the false pain so i could have an attack, which I would find out later to be wrong wrong wrong.


After going to a crapton of ""specialists"" and paying upwards of $10k, at the time I did not have health insurance, I finally found the cause. It was gas along with some acid reflux. Its weird, it wasn't the normal acid reflux that i had experienced before, it seriously felt like i couldn't breath and my heart was fluttering around. Sometimes i thought my heart would literally flip over.


A lot of the time the cause for weird gas pains is a http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiatus_hernia.

122,"What are some songs that feel deeper or more profound to you?  The vast majority of the music playing on the radio or on TV is fairly mindless, with lyrics that really require no interpretation or poetic skill to write.  Its just about having something catchy for people to latch onto.

Heres one that just came to my mind.  Its a song by Opeth.  I understand that a lot of people cant stand Death Metal / Black Metal.  One of the reasons I often appreciate it is because of the lyrics.  Not all of it is doom and gloom, and it often feels like theres more thought that goes into the words (regardless of whether anyone can understand any of ithaha).

Anyway, this is one of the most socially acceptable Black Metal-ish bands.  They are phenomenal at transitioning from acoustic parts with clean vocals into the heavy stuff with blackened vocals  and are skilled in both areas.  They even have an all acoustic album.  Several of their albums are concept albums  all of the songs are tied into a single story.  This is Face of Melinda from the album Still Life.  You can go to Wikipedia for the whole story of this album


By the turnstile beckons a damsel fair

The face of Melinda neath blackened hair

No joy would flicker in her eyes

Brooding sadness came to a rise


Words would falter to atone

Failure had passed the stepping stone

She had sworn her vows to another

This is when no-one will bother


And conceded pain in crumbling mirth

A harlot of God upon the earth

Found where she sacrificed her ways

That hollow love in her face


Still I plotted to have her back

The contentment that would fill the crack

My soul released a fluttering sigh

This day fell, the darkness nigh


I took her by the hand to say

All faith forever has been washed away

I returned for you in great dismay

Come with me, far away to stay


Endlessly gazing in nocturnal prime

She spoke of her vices and broke the rhyme

But baffled herself with the final line

My promise is made but my heart is thine

123,"My eyes are fluttering like butterflies in a violent storm.  At home I am reminded of the careful nature of life, as I find out the father of a close friend of mine has died at the tender age of 50.I could have been one of those taken with the spark of my youth, but alas, I was spared.  Because of that, I feel that I must make it worthwhile to continue with life, to live it as it is meant to be lived.  Not to sacrifice one breath, but to take in every breath with the awe and wonder that is life around us.  If not us, then who?  But can we ever truly appreciate this gift we've come upon, to exist, when soo many others never will.  I read once that ""we will all die, and that makes us the lucky ones"" and it couldn't be more true.  Think of all the potential lives that are in one drop of sperm, billions upon billions.  The fact that there are 6 billion people on the planet, for a while seems miniscule compared to those who never will live.  I just hope at my end, wherever it may be that I lived life and was satisfied.  There are those who do not find the bliss in the quiet of the night, the interest of unusal noises foreign to their ears.  It is an open-mindedness and appreciation of the world around us that helps us become better communicators with eachother. There is soo much beauty in a cool winter night that could be fully transcribed in paper, but the appreciation and recognition of it is what counts.

126,"Mythbusters had an episode on destroying things via resonance: the conclusion was that, since most structures tend to be non-linear dynamical systems under large displacements from equilibrium, attempting to destroy them via resonance wouldn't be easy.  They tried this on a bridge, but were not able to do anything to it.  

It is the rare dynamical system that is linear through large displacements from equilibrium.  This doesn't prove that it can't be done, only that it's not as trivial as people imagine, and the frequency must vary as a function of displacement in a non-linear, non trivial way.  

And if indeed it were easy to do, we would know about it (there's always some nutter that would attempt to do this - terrorists, for instance).

Paradoxically, bridges have collapsed through resonance before by accident, e.g. Tacoma Narrows. (**edit:** turns out that, though this is usually is given in engineering textbooks as an example of catastrophic forced resonance, the real cause of its failure was aeroelastic flutter, technically speaking).

127,"Once again, colloquial terms make this harder than it really is.

There are multiple things that can go wrong with the heart that fall under the layperson term ""heart attack.""

The rhythm of the heart's electrical system can go haywire and fire off nonsensical, chaotic beats instead of the typical ""dum-DUM"" of proper atrial and ventricular systole. This results in no actual beneficial pumping of the heart. It's called fibrillation, and it's treatable by shocking (DEfibrillation) the heart to sort of reset the heart's electrical system and fix this chaotic fluttering. This can happen in the atria or the ventricles.

Aystole is when the heart has completely stopped and there is no fibrillation, no beating, nothing but dormant cardiac tissue. This is NOT shockable. Yes ladies and gents, you've been lied to by popular culture. In all those movies where you see a hospital scene and the person is ""flatlining"" and miraculously is saved by defibrillation, that's bullshit. How could you DEfibrillate a heart that wasn't fibrillating?!

You can also have ventricular tachycardia, which it sounds like this soccer player had. This is when the heart is still beating, but way too fuckin' fast. This is going to wear out the heart's oxygen supply and generally not produce an effective stroke volume to supply the body with oxygen. This is also shockable. It's called a cardioversion.

What everyone thinks of when they hear ""heart attack"" is a myocardial infarction. This is when oxygen supply to some heart tissue is blocked for some reason and heart tissue begins to die. 

In my opinion, heart attack = myocardial infarction. But unfortunately the term has become a blanket term. That's fine. But under this blanket term, heart attack could technically = asystole, because that's a problem with the heart.

I personally am not a fan of the gold standard which is analogous to a car with no suspension, but neither are my a fan of ""aggressive monetary policy"" that will obviously lead to hyper inflation. Imagine a car that has way too much suspension, or a suspension bridge, like the [Tacoma Narrows Bridge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galloping_Gertie). The Tacoma Narrows was structurally vulnerable to sustained and moderately strong winds. This was due to a phenomenon called [aeroelastic fluttering](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeroelasticity) (owing to its unique plate-girder deck structure and ultimately its nickname The Galloping Gertie). This led to its collapse only months after completion. The collapse was [captured on film](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zczJXSxnw&amp;feature=fvst).

It's hard to describe it. It was a massive pit with huge column at the center. On the column there stood a huge figure with wings, dark and beastly. Around him fluttered beautiful butterflies in the most brilliant colors of yellow and blue. It was beautiful and terrifying at the same time.

We have this new girl at the restaurant I work. At about that same time I notice her, I also notice this gray sweater hanging on the wall everyday she worked.  It was by where my computer is towards the front of the restaurant.  To put things simply, she is quite cute and I figured why not smell her sweater and see how she smells, a natural mammalian instinct.  Wow.. the sweater smells fantastic, and for the next 3-4 weeks I indulge on smelling the sweater as soon as I get to work.  Sneakily of course, so as not to embarrass myself by getting caught smelling this sweater... I mean, shit I would be creeped the fuck out if I saw someone smelling my shit like that.

But soon enough, that day came. I came to work just as she was walking out of the backroom; she gets to work before me and leaves after me.  I decided to sneak a smell... I have OCD and am very obsessive about smells by the way.  Just then she comes around the corner, my face is burried in the sweater and I am inhaling with eyes fluttering.  My face goes red as fuck and I feel like I am about to faint, but she says nothing.  I think it is just the fact that she is freaked out, or maybe because she speaks very little English, but she doesn't even make a funny face, she even smiled a little.  She acts a little flirty with me later on in the day, so I don't feel so weird out by the whole thing anymore.

Along those lines, there's a group that has actually built several new Me-262s, Germany's first jet fighter to see service and combat, called [Stormbirds](http://www.stormbirds.com/).

I do like the ""Could've been a game changer"" analysis. In sufficient numbers, the Gotha -- it was to be produced by [Gotha](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothaer_Waggonfabrik) as the Go 229 -- would've been a great strike and reconnaissance plane and a good interceptor. That said, I think they make a good point about its potential handling issues. I doubt its [short period](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_period#Short_period_oscillations) mode would be well damped, making it hard to aim the guns in a dogfight as the aircraft oscillated around the pilot's aim point.

It's other flight characteristics may not have been bad, but they would have been strange. Dr. August Raspet of Mississippi State University (my alma mater) [flight tested](http://www.acsol.net/~nmasters/H-IV-report.html) a Ho IV tailless sailplane, from which the 229 descended, and found: 
&gt;It is beyond the scope of this paper to deal with the stability and control characteristics in detail, nevertheless, the author wishes to note that, in his opinion, the handling of the Horten IV is not essentially more difficult than that of any other high performance sailplane. The extremely good natured stalling and circling characteristics, as well as the excellent landing maneuverability are to be noted especially. The prone position of the pilot is believed to provide a more natural sensation of fight than the conventional sitting position; in addition, it provides incomparable visibility for landing and navigation. On the other side of the balance, however, the marginal directional stability, unusual response for rudder control coupled with pitch, and above all, the wing tip flutter, appearing above 140 km/h, should be noted.

If we can extrapolate from the Ho IV to the 229, the pitch/yaw coupling would be an extra challenge, particularly seeing that the yaw (directional) stability was ""marginal."" The pilot would have to work harder to keep the aircraft pointed and he'd have to deal with the pitch coupling when he did so. 

One last thought: 600 mph is getting near the [transonic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transonic) regime, and the 229 had a relatively thick wing section and (once again extrapolating from the Ho IV) an airfoil that wasn't laminar. As it turns out, laminar flow designs, particularly the NACA ""[6-series](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NACA_airfoil#6-series)"", are also very good transonic airfoils and the US aircraft (such as the P-51 and the P-80 [[List of airfoils](http://www.public.iastate.edu/~akmitra/aero361/design_web/airfoil_usage.htm)]) of the time were starting to use them. As a result, the 229 may have had even more trouble in the transonic regime than, most notably, the P-80, despite having a swept planform. (Swept wings delay the onset of shockwave formation on the wing and thus lower transonic drag, buffeting and control issues. Thin airfoil sections, certain airfoils and [area ruling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_rule) also help this.) Since all of the control surfaces are on the wing, as well, shock formation on the wing would've been particularly destabilizing and probably led to a slew of Go 229s accidentally diving into the ground, [P-38 style](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compressibility#Aeronautical_dynamics). Dive brakes would've helped that a lot, though. Maybe the spoilers could be deployed simultaneously. 

way tl:dr: Awesome link! I'm sad to see it isn't a flying copy. There's a group that did make flying copies of the Me 262. The 229 would've been a great strike/recon aircraft, but it probably would've faced some limitations as a fighter that may have kept it in the same class as the P-80 and Meteor.

On the other side of the balance, however, the marginal directional stability, unusual response for rudder control coupled with pitch, and above all, the wing tip flutter, appearing above 140 km/h, should be noted.

If we can extrapolate from the Ho IV to the 229, the pitch/yaw coupling would be an extra challenge, particularly seeing that the yaw (directional) stability was ""marginal."" The pilot would have to work harder to keep the aircraft pointed and he'd have to deal with the pitch coupling when he did so.

One last thought: 600 mph is getting near the transonic regime, and the 229 had a relatively thick wing section and (once again extrapolating from the Ho IV) an airfoil that wasn't laminar. As it turns out, laminar flow designs, particularly the NACA ""6-series"", are also very good transonic airfoils and the US aircraft (such as the P-51 and the P-80 [List of airfoils]) of the time were starting to use them. As a result, the 229 may have had even more trouble in the transonic regime than, most notably, the P-80, despite having a swept planform. (Swept wings delay the onset of shockwave formation on the wing and thus lower transonic drag, buffeting and control issues. Thin airfoil sections, certain airfoils and area ruling also help this.) Since all of the control surfaces are on the wing, as well, shock formation on the wing would've been particularly destabilizing and probably led to a slew of Go 229s accidentally diving into the ground, P-38 style. Dive brakes would've helped that a lot, though. Maybe the spoilers could be deployed simultaneously.

way tl:dr: Awesome link! I'm sad to see it isn't a flying copy. There's a group that did make flying copies of the Me 262. The 229 would've been a great strike/recon aircraft, but it probably would've faced some limitations as a fighter that may have kept it in the same class as the P-80 and Meteor.

Edits:

    * Realized wiki mentions spoilers in the control mechanism. These could be used as dive brakes, perhaps.
    * Grammar mistakes corrected (it's != its). Slight changes to style.
    * Added links.

Yes, you can check for a deep trance (as a result of hypnosis) through slower respiration, eye flutters, and other physiological changes. But that isn't always the case. 

There are many different ways to test if someone is hypnotized. For instance, you can tell someone to imagine themselves in a dark room and when they open their eyes, shine a light in them, and the pupils should remain dilated. 

You can also do little tests like ""you can't open your eyes no matter how hard you try"" or things of that nature - but those are obviously easier to fake. A trained hypnotist has his or her own series of tests and ways of figuring out if someone is faking it or not. Stage hypnotists in particular are very good at distinguishing between who is just playing along and who is actually ""under the influence.""

158,"I have an article on it here from The Belfast Telegraph that's no longer online:

By Hermione Eyre
01 August 2006

Ive got a quiet voice, says Daniel Tammet, in his gentle monotone. I think its because as a child I did-nt speak very much. I used to put my fingers in my ears to feel the silence, which was like a lovely trickling motion in my head. His eyelids flutter at the memory. It was hard for me to find my voice because I was, for so long, absorbed in my own world.

Daniels world is a rich and strange one, where every number up to 10,000 has colour, texture and emotional resonance. The number one is a brilliant and bright white, like somebody shining a torch beam into my eyes Four is shy and quiet, like me. Eighty-nine is like falling snow More remarkable still, he has described it all in Born on a Blue Day, his memoir of his life with synaesthesia and savant syndrome, a rare form of Aspergers. Dr Darold Treffert, a leading researcher in autism, says: Such first-person explanations of savant abilities are extremely rare, in fact nearly non-existent.

Daniels condition brings him great riches: his visualisation of numbers means he can perform extraordinary mathematical feats, and he holds the British and European record for reciting pi from memory to 22,514 decimal places. It also has its limitations. Forming relationships was difficult (until I was eight or nine, I didnt realise that other children were people with thoughts and feelings); supermarkets still are (too brightly coloured, too confusing).

When I meet him in the quiet London offices of his publisher, there are only a few signs of how different he is, a slight creakiness in his gait, a subtle overintensity in his gaze. I had to teach myself to look in some-bodys eyes, to make eye contact, he explains. Before that, I used to look at their mouth, because it was the part of their face that was moving, he says, as if it were the easiest mistake to make in the world. Which, in a way, it is, or certainly the most logical.

Theres also a stiffness, a vulnerability in his bearing. I watch as he stands before The Independent on Sundays photographer, as rigid as if he were in front of a firing squad. Sunlight flashes on his face and he begins to squint; immediately, his boyfriend, a mild-mannered computer programmer called Neil, bounds towards him solicitously. Are you OK?

Later, I ask Daniel if the pho-toshoot was such an ordeal that he used numbers to help him through. Yes. While we were outside I noticed a spiral staircase in one of the buildings which was nice as it reminded me of doing a fraction in my head.

Mental arithmetic is a gorgeous kaleidoscopic process for Daniel. Squaring numbers is a symmetrical process that I like very much, he says. And when I divide one number by another, say, 13 divided by 97, I see a spiral rotating downwards in larger and larger loops that seem to warp and curve. The shapes coalesce into the right number. I never write anything down.

His mathematical abilities are so extraordinary that it took a long time for them to be recog-nised. Daniel struggled at school (why, he wondered, were the numbers in the textbook not printed in their true colours, nine in blue, and so on?). He got a B at Maths GCSE. He wasnt diagnosed with Aspergers syndrome until three years ago, at 25.

Sooner would have been better both for me and my parents; consciousness-raising is part of his motivation for writing his book. My condition is invisible otherwise.

Scientists at Californias Center for Brain Studies were astounded when, two years ago, they discovered his facility for discerning prime numbers. They had assumed he must have been trained to do it. But to him, it is more like an instinctive process: Prime numbers feel smooth, like pebbles. The centre stays in close contact with Daniel.

The scientists and researchers come to me so I can help them design the parameters of their experiments, he says in his habitual monotone, neither proud nor modest. It is important to Daniel that he uses his gifts responsibly, perhaps for science, perhaps for teaching: he is already devising a new system of visualisation to help with language learning and dyslexia.

When I was growing up, my parents were very concerned that people shouldnt just get me to do tricks for them, he says. (He is a whizz at crowd-pleasers such as working out, from your date of birth, which day of the week you were born on.) My parents had this phrase performing seal. They didnt want me to be one.

Growing up as an undiagnosed savant was never easy. Daniel was lonely. I was desperate for a friend and I used to lie in bed at night thinking about what it would be like. My younger brothers and sisters had friends and I used to watch them playing to try to work out what they did and how friendship worked. Then, I would have traded everything for normality. But Ive since learned that being different isnt necessarily a bad thing.

Falling in love with Neil has been a large part of this. Emotions used to be difficult for him to understand without recourse to numbers. If I heard somebody was sad I would picture myself sitting in the dark hollowness of number six to help me understand the feeling. Now his emotional life is more like everyone elses. Love by its very nature puts things in perspective, joins the dots and helps me see life in a bigger way. Neil and Daniel, who have been together for six years, share an odd kind of domestic bliss. They have their tea together at exactly the same time every day; they have exactly 45g of porridge for breakfast, weighed on an electronic scale. Neil is very patient with me, and the routines I need to have to help with my anxieties, says Daniel. I dont know what Id do without him.

Generally, Daniel feels he is progressing all the time towards outgrowing his autism. He cried for the first time in his adult life a few years ago, when his cat died. My face was wet, and I knew that I was crying. Latterly, he has acquired a strong religious faith, which grew from an intellectual appreciation of the writings of G K Chesterton. And he is getting steadily better at social interaction. Every experience I have I add to my mental library and hopefully life should then get easier. In this, he seems to sum up the progress we all hope for.

But some experiences remain unique to him. I dont normally like films about emotions because I cant understand them. I enjoyed March of the Penguins, though. But when I watched the trailers first, I found that because they show the most dramatic moments one after another in quick succession, it made me feel so overwhelmed I burst into tears. No one else was affected, of course, and I felt silly. Next time Ill know to maybe not watch the trailers.
A life in numbers

Pi is for me a beautiful thing

Daniel Tammet can speak 10 languages, including Lithuanian and Welsh, as well as his own invented language, Mnti, which has about 1,000 words.

As part of a documentary that was made about him, called Brainman, Tammet learned Icelandic in a week, in front of the cameras. The culmination of the challenge was a live interview on Icelandic TV, which he coped with brilliantly.

He can recognise every prime number up to 9,973.

In 2003, he gave a public recital of pi in Oxford, in aid of the National Society for Epilepsy. Tammet recited it for five hours nine minutes, reaching 22,514 decimal places. Pi is for me an extremely beautiful thing, he says, like the Mona Lisa or a Mozart symphony.

On The Late Show with David Letterman, he calculated instantly that since Lettermans birth date was 12 April 1947, he must have been born on a Saturday and would reach 65 on a Thursday.

I'm just going to say one thing. You make some good points which should be addressed own, but one stands above all the rest of them.

164,"I have no problem with controversial views. I have to say something about unbridled insults.

&gt;Of course I might me biased...

This is a very honest and frank admission. I now understand your emotion a little better.

I don't really feel the need to reassure you about the love I have for my family, and just how much their well being means to me. 

Instead, let me say this, which is potentially my own biased opinion based on my own experiences:

I think that everyone who becomes a fatherintentionally or nothas to at some point come to grips with what exactly that means.

It's strange, even if you know that your sperm have fertilized her egg and can see the result of that process taking shape in her abdomen, it's all in a very abstract, academic way. Your partner knows otherwise, she can feel the new little person coming to life from his first tiny flutters. You, on the other hand have very little to prepare you for what is in store. Even when you can feel the kicking and hear the heartbeat, it's all very... detached.

But when that baby comes out.... just... holy *shit*. Really. That is all. It is the most bizarre and wonderful and indescribable feeling. It all hits you hard, all at once. It is the ultimate feeling of epiphany. And, for me, along with it came another new life. Not just hers, but a new life for me. I knew there was nothing more for me to worry about other than her health and happiness. There was no such thing as ""intent"" any more, she was here, she was mine and she was *awesome*.

I think what I'm saying is that no one can possibly comprehend what fatherhood is like until you're thrown in it. It's not how you got into it that matters, it's how you *respond* to it. I'm sure there are some men who couldn't wait to be dads but turned out to be deadbeats. I'm sure there are some extremely reluctant fathers that turn out to be doting dads. 

All I know for sure from my experience is that my kids bring meaning and purpose to my life like nothing else I've ever known.",2009-07-10 03:29:25

""Easy?""  Death Moth's eyes shifted to his pupil from the gathering news vehicles at the base of the hospital.  The news vans had all raced to the entrance and parked, leaving no room for ambulances or emergency patients.  If his luck persisted, Death Moth mused, more would die simply because of the media's short-sightedness.
	
""Yes, much less challenging than using the five-point exploding heart technique on Jackson or the radiation beam on Fawcett.""
	
The villain nodded and rubbed his sparse, greasy mustache. The upper half of his face was covered in a pink latex mask with two painted feathers jutting skyward.  His silk cape fluttered gaily beside him in the breeze.  The only explanation for his costume rested over his right nipple.  ""Mario Starkravingblah,"" the badge read; it was one of his many pseudonyms. ""Children's Hospital, Clown and Performer.""
	
After another moment passed, they stepped down from their vantage point and turned toward the utility access.  Death Moth used his security card to open the door, and they descended the hospital's stairs towards their waiting escape van, the Paparazzo.  As he opened the door to Parking Level A, the feathers on his helmet tingled.
	
""Get back, Mosquito Boy!"" he yelled.  As sure and quick as light invades darkness, his archnemesis the Investigator stood a dozen yards away, blocking access to their van.  Both villains barely dodged a beam of light from the Investigator's Flashlight of Truth and Justice.
	
""I anticipated the presence of a foul invertebrate such as you behind these assassins, Moth!""  shouted the Investigator.  Death Moth slammed the door midsentence and grabbed Mosquito Boy's arm, dragging him back up the stairs.  He reached into his utility belt with his free hand.  There were only two night spores left, but this was his only hoped.  He tossed it behind him onto the door.
	
They ran up together, Mosquito Boy having regained his footing and composure.  Behind them, they heard an angry curse as the Investigator opened the door and triggered the night spore.  A thick black gas and the sounds of coughing chased them back to the roof access door.
	
""Wings activate!"" shouted Death Moth.  His furling cape tightened into large moth wings.  Mosquito Boy's shoulder carapace released two sets of wings that began to rapidly flap.  They leapt from the top of the hospital just as the Investigator burst from the stairwell.
	
""Halt, wrongdoers!""
	
Mosquito Boy began to laugh as they fluttered down towards the sidewalk.  His laugh was cut short as the beam of light highlighted his form, burning away his wings.  He plummeted to the ground.
	
""No!"" roared Death Moth, dodging a second beam.  He looked down at his pupil's form, smashed like an insect against the asphalt.  He tilted his wings again and felt an illuminating flash burn away an antenna.  He passed behind a building, escaping from his pursuer's deadly beam.  Gracefully, he stretched upward, flapping his wings sideways and his legs touched the ground.
	
Turning toward the silhouette of the hospital, he bellowed his glorious threat, ""When I am finished, they will know all that I have taken from them, for I am Death Moth, the slayer of stars!""

175,"Ah I love drug trip stories! Bring them on friends!

Losing all sense of reality has been a token part of every mushroom trip I've ever been on. (About 10). Highlights:

* Walking around Wash U. around 3 in the morning on a spring day. Felt as though my shoulders were walking on the sidewalk sans body; I had lost total awareness of body and self. I was a puppet.  At some point on that walk, I encountered into a policewoman making the night rounds, likely wondering what the hell I was doing outside. Managed to not lose my shit. I swear that at one point she said and I quote ""I know how it is. I used to party a lot."" When she brushed her hair with her hand, sparkling rainbows came fluttering out. 

* A similar trip, but in the winter at U of I. It was around Christmas so the place was a ghost town. Late at night everything had a silvery layer of ice and snow. I decided that it was hugely important to ""experience"" cold. To ""understand"" the concept of cold. My god you do retarded shit on 'shrooms. So I took off my hat, gloves, jacket, etc., till I was shirtless and walking around. Managed to avoid the police that time. (And pneumonia). I stared at a crystalline tree outside my window for about an hour.

* One time a friend starting playing [Waternight](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pg0tuah-VA&amp;feature=related) on the stereo. That song is mind blowing sober. Tripping balls it made me feel like I was flying over mountains Superman style. The crazy part is that when we regrouped we concluded that we both had exactly the same visuals.

* Lastly I'm just going to throw out this PSA to you all, even though I know it doesn't *really* need to be said, but fuckit: Make sure you're tripping with a good group of people and in a comfortable place, and do not attempt to drive. 

I once found myself in The Valley (the horrible dystopia N. of the 101) with a crazy meth head I barely knew. I quickly realized I had to GTFO of there, so claimed sobriety enough to drive my car. Holy fuck what a retarded move. I made it around the block and pulled over and waited for the trip to subside. After about 45 minutes I was like ""okay I'm good to go."" Got on the freeway when I realized I was still completely fucked up. I know, I'm a horrible fuckhead for endangering everyone and myself. It was the easily the stupidest thing I've ever done. Somehow managed to exit right away, and took side streets till I got to Westwood. Holy shit I was lucky. And an idiot.",2009-07-18 22:20:16
176,"&gt; I've always found it annoying that the Flight 93 was shot down theory is lumped in with all the other conspiracy theories, as it's much more plausible than the official story.

Except that it's not at all fucking plausible. Have you seen what's left over when you shoot down a plane with a missile? Big fucking pieces, that's what. I've personally seen the wreckage of **dozens** of F-86 drones out at the Navy's China Lake missile test range. Planes are delicate. Missiles carry small warheads. Missile-hit targets lose big pieces of lightweight aluminum that flutter to the ground like leaves, and while the main body will hit with some force, it generally won't completely disintegrate. The very evidence that 93 conspiracists point to as evidence that it was hit with a missile (lack of sizable wreckage pieces) is actually fairly incontrovertible proof that the plane was intact and in a full power dive into the ground when it hit. THat's the only way you can reduce a plane to fragments. A missile hit does the very opposite.

Most such conspiracy theories are based on key points of ignorance like this. The classic ""kerosene fires couldn't bring down the towers"" one is based on a failure to differentiate between the **melting** temperature of steel and the much lower temperature at which it loses most of its structural strength.",2009-07-20 01:52:49

Freedom means not having to justify your actions, property, or preferences with a purpose, so long as you aren't hurting anyone else in the process. That means free to build shit or blow it up, free to eat bacon or granola bars, free to smoke pot or tobacco or nothing at all, free to fuck pussies or asses or both... And free to own, carry, and shoot handguns, if that's what makes your heart a-flutter.

So what purpose does a handgun serve?

Answer: It doesn't bloody matter. It's just an object, and as long as I'm not using it to hurt people, how many and what type I own, when I carry them, where, and how, is none of the government's business. It's not your business, either, unless I'm on your property or in your company.",2009-07-23 22:09:21
182,"I assume we'll just disagree on this, but I don't get why people have such extraordinarily high regard for Stewart, and I say this as a fan of the Daily Show.  From everything that I've read and heard, Jon Stewart deserves a lot of credit for making the Daily Show what it is today.  I've been watching since the Kilborn days, when I was in high school, and it was a funny show.  However, it was more of a parody of an Entertainment Tonight meets 20/20 show than political satire, and not nearly as good as it has become.  I get the impression that Stewart is responsible for the change in the show's focus, and he deserves credit for that.  Much of the comedy ""meat"" however, is in the show's entirely scripted bits, which is the responsibility of the writers.  When Stewart goes off script, his ""humor"" largely consists of his befuddled schmendrick routine, replete with mugging and goofy voices.  It's so broad as to be embarrassing and beneath the show's stature.  

His interviews are also pretty tame.  He heavily relies on his sympathetic audience to fill in the gaps that his scattershot interviewing style leaves, letting them collectively applaud and guffaw at some obvious, trite point he made in opposition to his guest, and then fails to pounce on the guests typically evasive response.  Then, everyone gets to have a circle jerk about what a ""fierce, hard hitting"" interview they'd just witnessed.  If you can find it, check out the John Bolton he did maybe about two years ago.  Stewart just lobbed him softball after softball, each somehow masquerading as a trenchant question, and Bolton just contemptuously dismissed Stewart's concerns without any push-back from Stewart himself.  Then, the internet was all aflutter with what a ""grilling"" Stewart had delivered.  It was anything but, and I say this as a fan of the Daily Show and most certainly not of Bolton.  (The one thing I'll hand Stewart is that I was impressed with the infamous Crossfire interview.  Not because Stewart was particularly slick or clever - relying on heavy sarcasm and calling Tucker Carlson a ""dick"" - but because it could have been a hostile audience.  Of course, if you remember, Stewart kind of soft-footed his way through the confrontation before it was apparent that the audience was responding favorably, but it still took some balls).

Reading what I've read so far, it sounds like I hate Jon Stewart.  I don't.  I love the Daily Show and think he's a competent host.  I just don't think he's our generation's Jonathan Swift.

Also, and what prompted me to write this response, the comparison to Stephen Colbert is absurd.  Colbert has to make arguments through a character with a completely different opinion, and he does this in a show where, interview segments combined with the guest interview at the end, he's off-script at least 25% of the entire show.  He's a masterful interviewer, and rarely relies on the slapstick antics that Stewart employs to keep himself afloat.  ",2009-07-24 02:50:58
183,"**The Stool**



I've been looking at this stool all day.

The origins of this stool are?

The thoughts of this stool are?

The stool is considered inanimate? Is it?

When lights turn off and custodians depart

Does the stool dance?

All is silent. Does the stool speak?

With none to observe who can say that

The stool does not turn somersaults over the chair?

In fact, who can say that the chair does not turn somersaults over

The stool?

The radio, the only one able to speak, babbles incessantly:

Stock prices, free form jazz, the temperature over the Bearing

Strait is ten degrees Centigrade;

Until being obliterated by a considerably annoyed clock, who

Possesses ears as well as hands.

A bust of Ben Franklin lights up and that diry the garbage can calls the cops.

Blue men carry Franklin away and toss him in a cell with the

Brothers bookend who refused to hold up their end of a bargain.

Chair-desks begin a square dance the likes of which no furniture

Has ever seen.

The magnets refuse to stop forming complex patterns so the chalk

Writes them up for disturbing the peace.

Encyclopedias, thinking they're so smart, hurl themselves

Across the room, their information fluttering uselessly about.

A special showing of Reservoir Dogs is being help upon the wall,

Unfortunately the wall could only afford one frame.

The roaring pencil sharpener grinds to shavings any wood he can

Get his rotating jaws on.

Yet what of the simple stool?

With its flat steel legs and battered plywood top it is evident that

The stool is wise enough to have an opinion about these events.

From a dusty factory in Patterson to the even tile floor of Dumont

High this stool has witnessed an astounding number of rather

Surprising events.

Why, he once bore witness to the marital union of a coffee mug

And a four and a half foot yard stick.

The immeasurable din generated by these raucous office supplies,

Is nothing when compared to the ruckus he used to make.

And now in his old age this stool wishes only to rest quietly in a

Dark closet.

To be silent, forgotten, rotting away with a hot young stool,

Her slender legs of oak or elm.

Yes with these conditions fulfilled the stool could exist forever,

Transcending time, space, and termites.",2009-07-24 03:12:32
184,"Now these guys seem like some really Goodfellas for trying to make a list of films that never received The Prestige of an Academy award for best picture, but I can't help but think that some of they have neglected some rather noteworthy films from their list.

Unfortunately, The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind has apparently left me at a loss for any to name, as The Dark Knight of forgetfulness has deemed to Snatch away even the faintest Memento of their memory from The Matrix of my mind.

The feeling of forgetfulness seems so unnatural... so Alien, like The Nightmare Before Christmas I had when I was Se7en, where Children of Men went Back to the Future to rob my memories and put a Pulp Fiction in their place. In fact, the more I think of it, the more I realize... these were no mere Hoop Dreams! These memories were not simply Lost in Translation! This is the work of a real menace, and not an imagined one!

Excited by my revelation, I tried read through nine volumes of U.S. history in search of any mention of The Thing that had deprived me of my memory. I had reached for American History X when suddenly, I heard a knock at my door! Fearing an unknown menace, I reached for a weapon to put an end to the intruder Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels. However, realizing that I may want to interrogate them for information, I opted for something non-lethal, my Fight Club. As the door swung outward into the Dark City, I raised my arm, only to find that my would-be attackers were merely a pair of file Clerks, apparently lost on their way to their Office Space.

""Hello,"" one of them said suddenly, ""I'm Doctor Akira, and this is Doctor Strangelove, from Fargo...""

""Doctor?"" I replied in surprise, ""Doctor... No, I have no interest in speaking with any doctors tonight. You must be searching for someone else. Good Night, and Good Luck.""

""Please!"" the wiry man insisted, ""If you don't hear us out, I fear There Will Be Blood!""

Intrigued, I allowed the men into my home. Immediately, Dr. Akira began to speak.

""This may sound... bizarre, but we fear the Army of Darkness are in possession of The Fifth Element and may be trying to create a Network between dimensions so that they may pour into this world...""

""You're right,"" I say, ""That does sound bizarre. Perhaps I'd better call you two a Taxi Driver...""

""Please, listen!"" the other man said, ""You have been forgetting things, yes? And you have this strange feeling that someone may be responsible? Well, we are telling you that it is true! There is a man who has been using the power of these demons to sap away men's soul's and use the emptiness left in its absence to forge a bridge to their world! Thankfully, it is currently A Bridge Too Far, but if he's allowed to continue, I'm afraid he'll succeed.""

""And who is this man?"" I ask.

""Well, we've had a hard time tracking him down. He's been on a killing spree, going from continent to continent, crossing Oceans... Eleven people he's killed so far, and we've thus far been unable to stop him. We've gone through our list of The Usual Suspects, and found nothing. He is quite The Professional. As far as assassins go, he's As Good as it Gets. He attacked the Amelie family last night outside a Casino as they were Leaving Las Vegas, leaving a rather gruesome crime scene, even for Sin City. Bonnie and Clyde Amelie were left in critical condition, and their son, Brian Amelie... well, he was left in such a state of Frailty that The Life of Brian was all but snuffed out by the time paramedics arrived...""

Suddenly, I felt a wave of Heat rush over me, and though my memories hadn't exactly returned, I somehow knew everything.

""Tell me, gentlemen,"" I said as I closed the curtains of my Rear Window, shutting out the bustling Metropolis outside, ""What brought you to me?""

""Bonnie and Clyde Amelie could not identify their attacker, but Brian's last words were 'don't Kill Bill! Don't Kill Bill!'. After looking in his address book, we saw only one Bill - you, Bill Oldboy. We assumed you were the killer's next victim.""

I grinned knowingly. ""Gentlemen,"" I said, ""I think you misunderstood...""

Suddenly, with the strength of a Raging Bull, I charged at the two men. With demonic strength flowing through me, I ripped them to shreds. Dr. Akira, apparently expecting a confrontation, was wearing a bullet-proof vest, but my hands became giant claws that bore through his Full Metal Jacket as if it were delicate silk. Dr. Strangelove screamed out, ""You alien Psycho! You'll pay for this!"" while shooting me with a handgun, but I simply laughed, ""It'll take more than that. You'll find I Die Hard. And it may interest you to hear that I am a full-blooded American Psycho, and there are no aliens involved. The Reservoir Dogs of dimension X are no Aliens, but messengers from the City of God! They shall be our salvation!""

""Reservoir Dogs?"" Dr. Strangelove asked, his brow furrowed.

""Sorry... I am dyslexic. I of course meant reservoir *gods*, the gods whose power is like a reservoir of pure energy, which will cleanse this world of all the impure!""

As I laughed, the man unloaded his full clip into me. And as The Fountain of blood burst from me, I knew I had succeeded in my quest. ""Thank you, you foolish, foolish men! In killing me, you have done what I could not - with my death, you have completed The Ring of the Twelve Monkeys, the twelve sacrifices to create the doorway to bring the reservoir gods into this world!""

And with my final breath, I imagined myself looking at a magnificent sunrise as The Birds fluttered across a Vanilla Sky... while the squeals of the reservoir gods filled my heart with Serenity.",2009-07-24 12:08:20

187,"As a girl I will say that eye contact is very good. But don't hold the look too long. Personally, I have a mental and physical reaction to it in which my body temperature rises noticeably and I get a little uncomfortable. But that can be flattering if you do it in the right dosage. It's cheesy, but even with total strangers, when you are looking them in the eyes, you feel like you know them better...or at least are connecting more.

188,"It's strange... I used to feel the exact same way.  I was never morally opposed to anyone's sexual preference.  Males were just a big turn off for me.  This was so until a couple years ago.  It was as if someone flipped a switch in my head.  It is very hard to explain but just the thought of a loving embrace from a fellow male caused my heart to flutter.  I was thrilled with the prospect that I was now bisexual.  It was as if a whole new world opened up to me.  

I felt less attracted to females, but I did not care.  I have been out of a relationship for quite some time.  I did not want to suffer another heartbreak, at least not from a female. 

... Or so I thought until a few days later.  That switch flipped once again.  I was again completely turned off by males.  I felt as if a part of me had shriveled up and died.  My attraction to females returned in full swing, but I longed for the return of that feeling towards males.

My wish had been granted a few weeks after, but lasting for a shorter amount of time.  The switch now seems to randomly flip every few days, or even within a day.  My attraction to males during the heterosexual phases seems to have increased, possibly due to memory.  It is comparable to my attraction to females during my homosexual phases.  It's incredibly confusing, but very invigorating as well.  

Any other bisexuals want to chime in?  Does the same happen to you or are you consistently bisexual all the time?",2009-07-29 07:32:16
189,"&gt; Fine, but our current legal structure is set up so that marriage is encouraged, in that it is legally advantageous to be married. Taxes etc. There's no legal advantage to fucking a random dude from Vegas in the ass (that I'm aware of)

If marriage is rewarded through tax breaks and so forth, why are people waiting until they're older to do it, getting divorced more often, and so forth?  I think that other social and personal factors greatly outweigh these supposed benefits to marriage.  Gay guys aren't getting married for tax breaks, they're getting married because they want to live in a committed relationship and have what they believe to be a normal family.  The concept of commitment is very important in any relationship, gay or straight.

&gt; That doesn't mean it's evolutionarily advantageous, though. 

The majority of ""homosexual"" men are actually bisexual.  Men, unlike women, do not suffer a significant biological risk from sexual intercourse (excluding disease, injury, etc) -- women, on the other hand, may carry a child for nine months and be committed to its care for nearly twenty years.  Men are thus more prone to be willing to have sexual intercourse on a given occasion than women, as the biological risk is lower.  Bisexual men are able to find mates earlier in life than heterosexual men, and thus combine the benefits of an older man (greater experience and expertise and understanding of relationships) with the benefits of a younger man (attractiveness, health, virility).  This is born out in studies, which show that bisexual men, even men with strong preferences for men as sexual partners, have many more female sexual partners throughout their lives than straight men do.

Women are a slightly different story; again, the majority of non-heterosexual women are bisexual.  Bisexual women tend to be bisexual for a phase of their lives (""college"") and then ""become"" straight.  But again, bisexuality has some interesting biological effects.  Bisexual women tend to have larger numbers of male partners than straight women and have children at an earlier age but have fewer children overall.  IIRC (this is the only part I don't remember for sure), these children tend to be healthier than the average.

This comes from the books I've read on evolutionary biology (*Sperm Wars*, *The Red Queen*, etc) and my sociology class on relationships I took a couple years back, as well as my mother's human sexuality textbook from about thirty years ago that I read as a kid.  I didn't make it up for the lulz, in other words.

&gt; I agree that sexual preference is not a choice. However, behavior is a choice - if you read on you'll see that my problem is not with homosexuality per se, but with our current public celebration of homosexuality.

Behavior is not really all that much up to choice.  Ever known someone who has really struggled to quit smoking?  (I did, just two months ago)  I'm fairly sure that Ted Haggard would rather not have been caught soliciting gay prostitutes.  And, really, pedophiles have to be aware that they're not very popular.

The problem with sexual preference, addiction, and things like that is that they're pretty goddamned powerful.  The sexual compulsion is extremely strong, strong enough to beat almost everything else.  Addiction is brutal too -- perfectly nice people go and get addicted to crack or an opiate and will kill you for drug money five years later.  That's why those of us with good sense don't use crack or opiates... but sexual preference is not a choice.

Wouldn't it be really upsetting to be born a normal, healthy, happy kid... but really like other boys instead of girls?  Not that you necessarily find girls icky or anything, but they just aren't what makes your heart flutter?  And be told that you cannot have a meaningful, long-term, formalized commitment that is recognized legally because of *other people's* thoughts about your lifestyle?  I personally think that sounds absolutely horrible, which is why I stay out of the way of gay people.

I also don't see the current situation as anything approaching a ""public celebration.""  Maybe it is in San Francisco, but as you're aware the city is viewed as a Mecca for homosexuals because of the level of tolerance there.  In Las Vegas, it's not spoken about.  In Ohio, where I lived for six years, I only met one person who said ""BTW I'm bi,"" even though I had to have met hundreds of homosexuals.  In New Mexico, where I lived basically my entire sentient life until 2003, you could get stabbed to death for calling someone a *maricon* or a *puto*, and there was no such thing as a public discussion of homosexuality.

I'm sorry -- I just don't see it.  Just like I don't see this massive victimization of Christians by atheists that is supposedly going on everywhere.  If there is a public celebration of homosexuality or the final triumph of atheism, I'm certainly not aware of it.

&gt; This is a good point - incest would probably not become acceptable even if it were legal. At the same time, your vision of a society where social order is maintained by taboo seems to be at odds with your belief that people should be able to do whatever they want if they're not directly harming anyone else. See the bottom of my post for more about this. And no, I don't have a sister, and I wouldn't pork her if I did.

I don't believe that the social order is or should be maintained by taboo.  I just mean that our individual personal preferences aren't going to change because something becomes legally acceptable.

190,"I was working at a water ride at the amusement park where I lived, and there was this family of ducks that decided to take up residence, or at least take a swim, in the 'splash zone' of the ride.  Well, we couldn't run the ride with the ducks in there or they would get sucked into the pump.  So me and my lead get out the pool skimmers to try to catch them.  They were big, eight to twelve foot long ones, so they were a bit unwieldy.  Now, the thing that you have to understand is that normally security has to handle 'wild animals' due to risk of injury, but they didn't want to get wet, so it was me and my lead - the person one step above me in power, but having minimal authority-  take off our shoes and go into the 'pool'; the majority of the area is about 4 inches deep, the trough that the boats go through is about 2.5 feet, leading to the 'pit' which is 12 feet, but we didn't go into there.  
So my lead and I are chasing these ducks, a mama duck and eight ducklings, around the ride for about an hour, the ducklings couldn't really fly, but they could flutter long enough to evade us.  What we had to do was scare the ducklings into diving, then scooping them up with the nets when they resurfaced.  This took about 45 minutes to catch all the ducklings, hand them off to security for them to take them to the nearby lake, and think about how to catch mom.  
Now, the mama duck could fly, and it did *not* want to leave.  We would stalk it, try to get our 'nets' around it, and it would fly to the other side of the ride.  About 10 minutes we switched strategies from trying to catch it to just trying to scare it out from the ride.  It took five minutes but we finally got the thing to leave.  At the end, the entire line was filled with people who were watching the utter spectacle of us trying to catch these ducks.  Fun times...fun times.

""Nystagmus is not to be confused with other superficially similar-appearing disorders of eye movements (saccadic oscillations) such as opsoclonus or ocular flutter that are composed purely of fast-phase (saccadic) eye movements, while nystagmus is characterised by the combination of a smooth pursuit, which usually acts to take the eye off the point of regard, interspersed with the saccadic movement that serves to bring the eye back on target. Without the use of objective recording techniques, it may be very difficult to distinguish between these conditions.""

213,"WordPress can be used as a CMS. When people do that, they usually turn off commenting and use a theme such as one from WooThemes, or make one custom. However, you can still leave commenting on if that's your thing, or leave it on only in certain areas.

WordPress is a dream under the hood compared to Drupal or Joomla.

No WordPress install should go without the Flutter plugin or the WP Cache.

WordPress is a 1000 times easier to theme.

One thing I really like about WP is that even when I want to do a little custom coding, I'm only really looking at like 60 lines of code here or there because of the beauty of its query system and built-in functions.

I recommend hiring a web designer + a PHP freelancer to work together in combination for you to build you a custom WP theme for your needs and then flesh it out with any custom PHP coding. Recommend the two plugins I mentioned. This very small cost to you will help you a great deal. From that, you can then just login to the admin system on WP and start creating records through the Flutter system, such as ""Add Staff Member"" with custom fields applicable to a staff member. These staff members will then appear formatted by how your theme is designed.

I mean, even if you go the custom route and add in a lot of bells and whistles in your requirements, you are usually looking at only about $1000-$1500 in the design and then $1000-$2500 in custom PHP coding.",2009-08-12 13:45:12
214,"I'll cut to the chase.  I have CF too.  I have seen many of my CF friends go through what your brother is right now, and it's honestly more painful to watch than to experience.  Some are living well to this day, post-transplant.  Some aren't.

What can you do for him (to help him medically)?  Nothing... but don't show him weakness or pity or your own sadness because he will see it and feel hopeless.  I know that seems trite or whatever, but a lot of people with CF already feel burdensome.  We especially don't want to make people upset when we have very cry-worthy things to deal with.  Just about any other day he could handle it all no problem, but right now what he needs is hope that he will get through this and get out of there so he can use his shiny new lungs.  After being in the hospital AND in pain for so long, I have no doubt his mind is now as fragile as his body.

What can you do to make him feel better?  Everything in the world.  Talk to him sure, but let him rest too.  Communication doesn't always need to be in words, but a dry erase board could help.  Seeing my friend's eyes flutter told me he knew I was there... and he was listening.  Even if you never acted emotional or loving around him before... now's the chance.  Trust me, he's not going to mind.  If (and I sincerely hope this is not the case) you never do get to tell him, you will regret it the rest of your life.  So tell him everything.  

As for helping in other ways -  since he cannot speak, you (or his wife or parents I presume) are his advocates.  You need to speak up to get him more hospital pillows.  You need to speak up when he isn't getting any care he needs: pain meds, get his bed changed, wean him off the vent, make sure he is getting enough O2 so he doesn't feel like he's drowning.

Taking off my internet hyperbole hat, foam has it's place: it does absorb flutter echoes. No better than drapes or carpet, in my experience (for best results, hang the absorber an inch or so in front of the walls, so that the sound has to cross the air/solid/air barrier twice before hitting your ears - once as it leaves, and once after it bounces off the wall. And for FUCKS SAKE spray everything with fire retardent).
AND, more importantly, if can fool newbies (and CEOs) into thinking they are in a 'proper' studio.

However, the big problems in a smallish music environments (unless you are recording/mixing in a greenhouse) are resonant modes in the low mids and lows: where certain frequencies are reduced and enhanced based on the standing waves that build up in the room. Foam does jack shit down here. You need resonating boxes, or as mentioned in other posts here, fibreglass. 

Ethan Winer is kind of the king of home studio treatment. Here is a very, very old article that explains his opinino on how to do it right. 

http://www.ethanwiner.com/acoustics.html

&gt;Many studio owners and audiophiles install acoustic foam all over their walls, mistakenly believing that is sufficient. After all, if you clap your hands in a room treated with foam (or fiberglass, blankets, or egg crates), you won't hear any reverb or echoes. But thin treatments do nothing to control low frequency reverb or reflections, and hand claps won't reveal that. Basement studios and living rooms having walls made of brick or concrete are especially prone to this problem - the more rigid the walls, the more reflective they are at low frequencies. Indeed, simply building a new sheet rock wall a few inches inside an outer cement wall helps to reduce reflections at the lowest frequencies because a sheet rock wall that flexes also absorbs a little.

But then I found out with the CCK that you have to go back and install other things like filefield, mp3player, junk like that. So what I'm trying to say is that I felt like I couldn't even be functional unless I installed a few good core modules that are often recommended in the Drupal books.

I found Drupal much harder to theme even with the Zen theme compared to WordPress, which is a snap to retheme.

I found Drupal really sloppy under the hood compared to WordPress.

In WordPress, people *expect* that you'll usually want to do some custom PHP coding in your themes, and there are tons of great snippets out there to show you how to do something small. But in Drupal, I found that if you can live within the constraints of a module and have grasped the CCK and Views, you can accomplish much of what you want without doing any PHP at all. But the Drupal runs a little slower because it's got so much goo in it compared to WordPress. So, in the end, WordPress was better for me.

I didn't fit in and had a bad social situation at school. Later I transferred schools and my depression was not as bad. I went off the pills when I was 13 because I had heard of sexual side effects and did not want them to affect puberty. After about 2-4 weeks, the fuzziness, the cloudiness in my head started lifting, and I felt more emotionally active instead of emotionally dead.

I'm 22 now and have undergone some bad times in my life, but I never underwent medication for SSRI's again. However, I was diagnosed with adult ADD in college. Often, ADD and Depression go hand-in-hand, and fixing one can sometimes help out the other. See if your doctor could run a test for ADD, maybe try out medication. It helped me enormously, because in school I would understand concepts perfectly, but I could never complete my assignments well or turn them in or get organized.

Year after year I struggled to get myself and my work under control before finally seeing a doctor and asking whether I had ADD. Turns out I do, and medication has been working very well for me. However, I do not rely on it, and take it only when I need acute presence of mind, to study for exams, etc. Most of the rest of the time I just try to rely on the skills I had to develop to get through high school.

The objective is to think of nothing, but you will quickly find thoughts fluttering around your mind. That's ok, acknowledge them and let them go. Don't entertain them but don't struggle to banish them. The easier you come out of meditation, the easier it is to go back in. After a while, you'll notice that you slip into the ""high"" easier and can meditate longer. It does wonders for my concentration, my posture, stress, ease of living, and poise. 

Eat healthy. Drink lots of water. Sleep well. You'll be surprised how often people choose to ignore these things, but essentially how important they are. 

Be well and smile more often, even if you don't feel like it. I think you should go off meds, they just make you feel nothing instead of allowing you to really live. Accomplishments, health, love, and friendship can kill depression where it stands. ",2009-09-06 17:03:25

256,"Wow, I didn't mean it to sound like that at all!

I didn't mean that I didn't care! I remember agonizing over my own virginity.  
And the thing  you have to remember is, while perhaps there is more social pressure on men to lose their virginity, there is an assumption that women can just flutter their eyelashes and instantly get some. 
As a girl who used to be painfully shy, I can tell you that if you're a girl and have had zero sexual experiences, you really start to believe that there must be something horribly wrong with you. That you're ugly, that you're too awkward, etc.

What I meant to say was that the more you stress over it, the more it  will become this unclimbable mountain. Tell yourself that it's no big deal, that it's not about YOU, its just a lack of opportune situations. Quit making everything you do about sex, and start making everything you do about relationships, it will eventually come along -and be a nice surprise.

257,"&gt; Wow, I didn't mean it to sound like that at all!

Don't worry - it didn't.  But what you say isn't always what someone else hears, especially when they're as neurotic and fucked up as the OP. ;-)

Someone in his position thinks (basically) that ""women are bitches because they won't sleep with him"".  You can try to get him to realise that women aren't bitches, or you can get him laid - either of these will help ease his issues.  However, when you're a lonely, single, frustrated, bitter, seething pot of hormones that just... wants... to... get... laid the one thing that won't work is someone trying to convince you that sex isn't everything.  It's like trying to convince a drowning man that oxygen isn't all it's cracked up to be. ;-)

&gt; while perhaps there is more social pressure on men to lose their virginity, there is an assumption that women can just flutter their eyelashes and instantly get some. As a girl who used to be painfully shy, I can tell you that if you're a girl and have had zero sexual experiences, you really start to believe that there must be something horribly wrong with you.

See, that's true to an extent, but of all the women I know who have ever complained to me that they ""couldn't find a man"", what they meant 100% of the time was ""I can't find a man that's up to *my standards*"" - in the worst case they could go out to a bar, get pissed and there will *always* be some guy who'd sleep with them.

For many young guys, ""I can't get a girl"" means *exactly that* - they do not know of a single female in the entire world who would have sex with them.

I know that many girls are looking for more than a quick fuck, and that standards are important, but there's a material difference between ""I don't know anyone who I fancy who likes me"" and ""I don't know a single individual in the entire *world* who likes me"".

Although I'm straying perilously close to gender-stereotyping here, most women spend their entire lives swimming in a sea of low-grade male attention - they may not get attention from *guys they like back*, but at least they get attention at all, or at least know they could find some if they overcame their shyness and tried.  Many young guys are much more on the outside, with no attention *at all* to offset the typical teenage insecurities, social difficulties or body issues, and no hope of getting any *no matter what they do*.

It's literally out of the guys' hands - nothing they can do will guarantee attention.  Even the ugliest, shyest girl in the world *could* put on a miniskirt, go to a bar, get pissed and find someone to go home with if she let herself.  Young guys can't say the same.

&gt; Tell yourself that it's no big deal, that it's not about YOU, its just a lack of opportune situations.

The trouble is, the OP isn't making it specifically about *him* - he's making it about *all other women everywhere*.  He's not saying ""God, I'm such a fucking loser no wonderful, soft, caring woman will ever want me"" - he's basically saying ""All I want is a simple, meaningless fuck and the fucking *bitches* won't put out"". ;-)

&gt; Quit making everything you do about sex, and start making everything you do about relationships, it will eventually come along -and be a nice surprise.

This is true, and a very mature, sensible response.

Unfortunately, however, I don't think the OP is going to respond to that level of maturity in the same way I don't think a concussed duckling is going to respond to a lecture on quantum mechanics. &lt;:-)

It's also a variant of ""sex isn't a big deal"", and (as I pointed out above), that's an approach that's going to bounce straight off his bitterness and teenage hormones without leaving a dent.

Teenage guys (and even full-grown guys like the OP) are basically twisted-up, bitter walking hard-ons.  Ever tried convincing *an erection* that sex isn't that important? ;-)

&gt; Thanks for taking the time to explain what I hadn't considered. :)

No worries.  Guys are comparatively simple creatures (at least, IME, compared to most women ;-), but there are still a lot of subtle wrinkles and small details that women typically don't really understand about guys until another guy takes them aside and explains it. ;-)",2009-09-08 08:46:10

260,"Reminds me of a short story by Mark Twain:

**The War Prayer**

by Mark Twain

It was a time of great exulting and excitement. The country was up in arms, the war was on, in every breast burned the holy fire of patriotism; the drums were beating, the bands playing, the toy pistols popping, the bunched firecrackers hissing and sputtering; on every hand and far down the receding and fading spread of roofs and balconies a fluttering wilderness of flags flashed in the sun; daily the young volunteers marched down the wide avenue gay and fine in their new uniforms, the proud fathers and mothers and sisters and sweethearts cheering them with voices choked with happy emotion as they swung by; nightly the packed mass meetings listened, panting, to patriot oratory which stirred the deepest depths of their hearts, and which they interrupted at briefest intervals with cyclones of applause, the tears running down their cheeks the while; in the churches the pastors preached devotion to flag and country, and invoked the God of Battles, beseeching His aid in our good cause in outpourings of fervid eloquence which moved every listener. It was indeed a glad and gracious time, and the half dozen rash spirits that ventured to disapprove of the war and cast doubt upon its righteousness straight way got such a stern and angry warning that for their personal safety's sake they quickly shrank out of sight and offended no more in that way.

Sunday morning came  next day the battalions would leave for the front; the church was filled; the volunteers were there, their young faces alight with martial dreams  visions of the stern advance, the gathering momentum, the rushing charge, the flashing sabers, the flight of the foe, the tumult, the enveloping smoke, the fierce pursuit, the surrender!  then home from the war, bronzed heroes, welcomed, adored, submerged in golden seas of glory! With the volunteers sat their dear ones, proud, happy, and envied by the neighbors and friends who had no sons and brothers to send forth to the field of honor, there to win for the flag, or failing, die the noblest of noble deaths. The service proceeded; a war chapter from the Old Testament was read; the first prayer was said; it was followed by an organ burst that shook the building, and with one impulse the house rose, with glowing eyes and beating hearts, and poured out that tremendous invocation:

""God the all-terrible! Thou who ordainest, Thunder thy clarion and lightning thy sword!""

Then came the ""long"" prayer. None could remember the like of it for passionate pleading and moving and beautiful language. The burden of its supplication was, that an ever-merciful and benignant Father of us all would watch over our noble young soldiers, and aid, comfort, and encourage them in their patriotic work; bless them, shield them in the day of battle and the hour of peril, bear them in His mighty hand, make them strong and confident, invincible in the bloody onset; help them to crush the foe, grant to them and to their flag and country imperishable honor and glory  An aged stranger entered and moved with slow and noiseless step up the main aisle, his eyes fixed upon the minister, his long body clothed in a robe that reached to his feet, his head bare, his white hair descending in a frothy cataract to his shoulders, his seamy face unnaturally pale, pale even to ghastliness. With all eyes following and wondering, he made his silent way; without pausing, he ascended to the preacher's side and stood there, waiting. With shut lids the preacher, unconscious of his presence, continued his moving prayer, and at last finished it with the words, uttered in fervent appeal, ""Bless our arms, grant us victory, O Lord our God, Father and Protector of our land and flag!""

The stranger touched his arm, motioned him to step aside  which the startled minister did  and took his place. During some moments he surveyed the spellbound audience with solemn eyes, in which burned an uncanny light; then in a deep voice he said:

""I come from the Throne  bearing a message from Almighty God!"" The words smote the house with a shock; if the stranger perceived it he gave no attention. ""He has heard the prayer of His servant your shepherd, and will grant it if such be your desire after I, His messenger, shall have explained to you its import  that is to say, its full import. For it is like unto many of the prayers of men, in that it asks for more than he who utters it is aware of  except he pause and think.

""God's servant and yours has prayed his prayer. Has he paused and taken thought? Is it one prayer? No, it is two  one uttered, the other not. Both have reached the ear of Him Who heareth all supplications, the spoken and the unspoken. Ponder this  keep it in mind. If you would beseech a blessing upon yourself, beware! lest without intent you invoke a curse upon a neighbor at the same time. If you pray for the blessing of rain upon your crop which needs it, by that act you are possibly praying for a curse upon some neighbor's crop which may not need rain and can be injured by it.

""You have heard your servant's prayer  the uttered part of it. I am commissioned of God to put into words the other part of it  that part which the pastor  and also you in your hearts  fervently prayed silently. And ignorantly and unthinkingly? God grant that it was so! You heard these words: 'Grant us victory, O Lord our God!' That is sufficient. The whole of the uttered prayer is compact into those pregnant words. Elaborations were not necessary. When you have prayed for victory you have prayed for many unmentioned results which follow victory  must follow it, cannot help but follow it. Upon the listening spirit of God the Father fell also the unspoken part of the prayer. He commandeth me to put it into words. Listen!

""O Lord our Father, our young patriots, idols of our hearts, go forth to battle  be Thou near them! With them  in spirit  we also go forth from the sweet peace of our beloved firesides to smite the foe. O Lord our God, help us to tear their soldiers to bloody shreds with our shells; help us to cover their smiling fields with the pale forms of their patriot dead; help us to drown the thunder of the guns with shrieks of their wounded, writhing in pain; help us to lay waste their humble homes with hurricanes of fire; help us to wring the hearts of their unoffending widows with unavailing grief; help us to turn them out roofless with their little children to wander unfriended the wastes of their desolated land in rags and hunger and thirst, sports of the sun flames of summer and the icy winds of winter, broken in spirit, worn with travail, imploring Thee for the refuge of the grave and denied it  for our sakes who adore Thee, Lord, blast their hopes, blight their lives, protract their bitter pilgrimage, make heavy their steps, water their way with tears, stain the white snow with the blood of their wounded feet! We ask it, in the spirit of love, of Him Who is the Source of Love, and Who is the ever-faithful refuge and friend of all that are sore beset and seek His aid with humble and contrite hearts. Amen.""

Glenn Beck is announcing a new major news event, every single one of his viewers is encouraged to make time to see this particular broadcast, which will be completely LIVE, because it will shake their world to its very foundations.

""America,"" he begins, ""I have something important to share with you, and I need a little help from a very popular man to help me express it.""

Glenn then somberly rises from his chair, circumnavigates his desk, and strides purposefully over to a large screen, emblazoned with the FOX NEWS logo.

He then gives a slight cue to a fellow conspirator in the whole charade, the one person he made sure he could trust, a forever anonymous figure behind a desk, safely out of sight.

Sure, I knew there was gay marriage.  I loved the fact that it could happen.  But I figured people would at least have some opposition.

One day we all went to Provincetown and walked down the ""Dick Dock"".  While walking, they put there arms around eachother.  I was slightly behind them and I saw this.

Black, white, straight, gay...everyone was there to be a person.

I went to the tip of Cape cod with them that evening, and as the sun set, I cried into the sand thinking about how beautiful it all was.

276,"Yes, one time after I snorted some dipropyltryptamine (DPT).

I was laying on a couch at night next to an open window.  Trees and moonlight visible when I looked up.  My DPT trip started up modestly at first, I'm having trouble keeping my nostrils clear since after snorting the HCl they clogged up.  I begin feeling the effects, some laughing, sounds start being drawn out, time starts dilating.  I start feeling all sensations simultaneously, believing I'm in a staticky sea of hot, cold, skin, sinew, blood, love, hate, food, water, orgasms, piss, shit.  Beginning and end came together into a singularity where all things I thought were different and distinct became the same one feeling of existence.

Then the crazy shit started happening.

Time was progressing in a way that everything moved for a few frames, then turned black and white, froze, and got covered in dust.  Then it re-colorized, moved a few more seconds, froze. Move. Freeze. Move. Freeze. It took me a few seconds or maybe minutes to realize what I was seeing.  They were fields, at night, moon shining brightly, reproductive cells from the plants in the field floating through the wind over the fields cast against the backdrop of the moonlit sky.

I looked around and felt myself on a tree branch.  I tasted harsh digestive chemicals in my mouth and saw woodland floor when I looked in the direction I thought was down.  My prior 28 years of human experience completely disppeared; I thought I was an insect of some kind, perhaps a locust.  The wind picked up and I felt so strongly, so intensely the drive to leap off my branch and let the wind carry me wherever it may.  My own free will felt displayed as the illusion it was, so clearly as a reaction to environmental circumstance, no consciousness existed.

Then I heard myself take a breath, a human breath, and remembered what I was.  I came back to reality.  I realized the branch I was perched on was one I had seen out the window, the wind was wind I felt blowing in on me over the couch, the harsh chemicals in my throat mucous that had dripped from my nose.

I regressed into a different creature and for a few seconds had been utterly and completely convinced I was that creature, like the overwhelming experience of moonlight, wind, and cold had simply overridden my human operating system and reactivated vestigial insect code.

I cried.  Then I licked my skin to see what it tasted like.

I wonder if I might some day wake up as some kind of more advanced life form, posting via telepathic physic link about this crazy trip I had of being human.

This trip was really intense though.  The visions continued.

I was soon looking at a sunset with hummerbirds fluttering about and sailing off into the distance. I felt at this moment simultaneously connected to everyone in the entire world, all of us so overwhelmed by the simple and majestic beauty of the moment that we began to sob, hearing each of them say ""with regards"" to me as I met their gaze.  I focused long enough and realized the sun I was staring at was simply a lamp in my apartment, and the fluttering hummingbirds I was seeing were actually being created from sounds I was hearing: the sound of my trip-sitter typing on her laptop.

I went into my bedroom to get more quiet and looked into a dark corner of the room.  In the darkness I had a vision of a thin, pale-skinned woman with dark eyes, dark brown hair and freckles.  She wore a pink slip and was looking at me from over her shoulder.  I concentrated on her some more and she began to zoom away from me, revealing to me that she was actually just some patterns I had mistaken for a person on the wing of a fly. The fly also zoomed out and disappeared and left me with just the black corner again.

I rolled over onto my back and stared up at the ceiling.  That's when I began to float up into the air, and as I floated I was being bathed with primary colored light, so vibrant, so brilliant that it seemed clearer than HD, as if you could somehow exponentially improve the visual quality of HD.  It was hyper-real.

An excerpt:

""Ahbhu looked at me and I know he was just a dog, but if he could have spoken with human tongue he could not have said more eloquently than he did with a look, don't leave me with strangers.
So I held him as they laid him down and the vet slipped the lanyard up around his right foreleg and drew it tight to bulge the vein, and I held his head and he turned it away from me as the needle went in. It was impossible to tell the moment he passed over from life to death. He simply laid his head on my hand, his eyes fluttered shut and he was gone.

I wrapped him in a sheet with the help of the vet, and I drove home with Ahbhu on the seat beside me, just the way we had come home eleven years before. I took him out in the backyard and began digging his grave. I dug for hours, crying and mumbling to myself, talking to him in the sheet. It was a very neat, rectangular grave with smooth sides and all the loose dirt scooped out by hand.
I laid him down in the hole and he was so tiny in there for a dog who had seemed to be so big in life, so furry, so funny. And I covered him over and when the hole was packed full of dirt I replaced the neat divot of grass I'd scalped off at the start. And that was all.

280,"&gt;One method of killing was to blind a single bird by sewing its eyes shut using a needle and thread. This bird's feet would be attached to a circular stool at the end of a stick that could be raised five or six feet in the air, then dropped back to the ground. As the bird attempted to land, it would flutter its wings, thus attracting the attention of other birds flying overhead. When the flock landed near this decoy bird, nets would trap the birds and the hunters would crush their heads between their thumb and forefinger.

You know, I said this once before: the only way I'll hunt is if what I'm hunting has an equal chance of killing me.

So if you want to go moose hunting with me, be prepared to arm yourself with a rock and smear yourself in animal feces to cover your scent.

282,"Let's not forget the [Ten Rules of Anti-Flirt Club:](http://www.shorpy.com/node/4755#comment-44513)

The code of guidance for the Anti-Flirt Club, as published in The Washington Post, Feb 28, 1923:

1. Don't flirt: those who flirt in haste oft repent in leisure.
2. Don't accept rides from flirting motorists - they don't invite you in to save you a walk.
3. Don't use your eyes for ogling - they were made for worthier purposes.
4. Don't go out with men you don't know - they may be married, and you may be in for a hair-pulling match.
5. Don't wink - a flutter of one eye may cause a tear in the other.
6. Don't smile at flirtatious strangers- save them for people you know.
7. Don't annex all the men you can get - by flirting with many you may lose out on the one.
8. Don't fall for the slick, dandified cake eater - the unpolished gold of a real man is worth more than the gloss of a lounge lizard.
9. Don't let elderly men with an eye to a flirtation pat you on the shoulder and take a fatherly interest in you. Those are usually the kind who want to forget they are fathers.
10. Don't ignore the man you are sure of while you flirt with another. When you return to the first one you may find him gone.

We didn't want to touch him. So we just sat there for a while to see if he ever showed any obvious signs of life. But the only sound or movement which came stemmed from a breeze causing the edges of his blood-stained clothes to flutter.

307,"Hi. Im a masters student in acoustics. Passion for architectural acoustics.  When you say you hear the room it could be a number of things... not enough absorption means lots of energy keeps bouncing around the room and you get a long reverberation time. This makes things sound muddy. Reverberation time is typically the most surface/obvious contribution from the room. Aside from that, the shape of the room also 'colors' the recording, emphasizing and diminishing the strength of certain frequencies. This is especially true in small rooms. If the dimensions of the room (LxWxH) are integer multiples this effect becomes more pronounced. Reflections off smooth walls are mostly specular, meaning they act like rays of light. This means echos (even if they are too close in time to be perceived as echos) will arrive at regular intervals. This is another way of thinking about how the room colors the sound. The effect is called a flutter echo and can be heard when an impulse trails off it it is especially bad (clap your hands).  Egg cartons wills scatter the energy in many directions so that the reflections are not specular. BUT that is only true for frequencies with wavelengths on the order of the corrugations of the cartons, so it's sort of silly. Although they will abosrb some high frequencies. You need some BIGGER feature in the room to break up lower frequencies. Bookshelves are a classic solution. Throw a couch in there if the reverb time is too long.  Or carpet. Post a recording, room dimensions would also be sweet. If bass is a problem (couch and carpet wont help too much) build a bass trap and stick it in a corner!

All else fails people have written code to perform adaptive filtering (deconvolution, echo cancellation, de-reverberation ...basically the same thing).  This stuff calculates the changing room impulse response of your room (it varies as source &amp; receiver positions do) and eliminates it's effects.  ",2009-10-01 04:51:57

It sounds like you're waiting for that magical person thats going to make your heart flutter. 

It's going to be tough for guys(non-virgin) to get close to you enough emotionally for you too feel they might be the one that you lose it to. I'm only speaking from personal experience and just about every other guy i've ever met, but the timeline usually goes: First date, dating, playing around, heavy sexual petting, sex, and then maybe later on love, not always...a lot of times the intellectual conversation+sex+time==love, but not always. 

Now that timeline varies from guy to guy, some guys get all that in a day, some skip a few, but the punchline is guys have a hard time with intimacy when their isnt any intimacy. I know this makes me sound like im saying you should just go for it with the next guy you like. Not at all, i say keep waiting until you feel comfortable and wanting to share that experience with whoever you're seeing. Cause thats the whole point, sharing that moment of ecstacy with a person you care about....well that and getting off. I mean both are good :)

327,"I am on a mild antidepressant (Cipramil) and have been for two years. Hoping to start weaning myself off it early next year as I am stable again and the reasons for the depression that got me onto them have been dealt with. 

I went onto the meds after visiting my GP with what I (paranoidly) thought were symptoms of heart disease (fluttery heartbeat, lump in my chest), starting to cry in the appointment, and him asking a series of questions that indicated that I was mildly depressed. He said we should just watch it - I was undergoing major changes at work and in a relationship I was having, and we were both reluctant to hit it immediately with medication given that some emotional disturbance was to be expected given the circumstances. 

A few months later I fell off the edge, as it were, and became seriously depressed (stopped eating, chronic insomnia, feelings of hopelessness, inability to make decisions, and so on), visited my GP again and he started me on the meds. They didn't work and after four months I sought out a psychiatrist who changed the prescription to something that has been effective, though after three months we had to tweak the dosage. I felt I also wanted to try talk therapy, which is what I've done - I talk to my psychiatrist once a month - highly recommended. Not easy, and slow, but revelatory.

I feel a lot more like myself than I did before I went onto the antidepressants - major depressive episode combined with burnout led to me feeling like a complete zombie. Sometimes I would get home from work and sit in my car for ages, wondering why I should bother to get out. Whenever I went to the beach I thought about drowning myself. Sometimes I went to the beach specially so I COULD think about drowning myself. Fortunately the water is really cold where I live, and I'm a coward!

What did make me feel terrible was what I fondly refer to as my ""horse tranquiliser"", a drug (Solian - not available in the US) that I was on for a year to control anxiety and panic symptoms. Before we (my psychiatrist and I) got the dosage right, I was sleeping upwards of 80 hours a week, often for the whole day on weekends, yawning constantly and unable to feel emotion or motivation. These drugs are not called chemical straightjackets for nothing.

I do suspect that the antidepressants diminish my ability to feel strong emotions, but it's difficult to tell for sure because I am a very easy going person as a rule. I definitely cry less now that I am on them - even when I was ""happy"" before the meds, I cried more than I do now, because of happiness or sadness or feeling overwhelmed by a piece of music or a landscape or something. Only lately have I started feeling that my emotions are as accessible as they were before I went on the medication - not sure why.

I browse both websites, and while both (gasp) have their pluses and minuses, it seems to me simply pure objective fact that Reddit is _way_ more hardcore with the sensationalist headlines.  I have, for example, never seen an article on digg with a word like ""SHAME"" jammed into the title, but it seems to flutter up on a pretty regular basis over here.

It only takes a moment's reflection to realize why this would be the case.  Reddit's userbase is smaller, more liberal, and more motivated.  Digg, being larger, has a more diverse userbase, and while it is certainly nonetheless liberal, articles need to be presented in a more vanilla way to make it to the front page (inb4 ""no digg is only about whatever the power users want"").

331,"Daffodils

Remember how we picked the daffodils?
Nobody else remembers, but I remember.
Your daughter came with her armfuls, eager and happy,
Helping the harvest. She has forgotten.
She cannot even remember you. And we sold them
It sounds like sacrilege, but we sold them.
Were we so poor? Old Stoneman, the grocer,
Boss-eyed, his blood-pressure purpling to beetroot
(It was his last chance,
He would die in the same great freeze as you),
He persuaded us. Every Spring
He always bought them, sevenpence a dozen,
'A custom of the house'.

Besides, we still weren't sure we wanted to own
Anything. Mainly we were hungry
To convert everything to profit.
Still nomads--still strangers
To our whole possession. The daffodils
Were incidental gilding of the deeds,
Treasure trove. They simply came,
And they kept on coming.
As if not from the sod but falling from heaven.
Our lives were still a raid on our own good luck.
We knew we'd live for ever. We had not learned
What a fleeting glance of the everlasting
Daffodils are. Never identified
The nuptial flight of the rarest ephemera -
Our own days!

We thought they were a windfall.
Never guessed they were a last blessing.
So we sold them. We worked at selling them
As if employed on somebody else's
Flower-farm. You bent at it
In the rain of that April - your last April,
We bent there together, among the soft shrieks
Of their jostled stems, the wet shocks shaken
Of their girlish dance-frocks -
Fresh-opened dragonflies, wet and flimsy,
Opened too early.

We piled their frailty lights on a carpenter's bench,
Distributed leaves among the dozens -
Buckling blade-leaves, limber, groping for air, zinc-silvered -
Propped their raw butts in bucket water,
Their oval, meaty butts,
And sold them, sevenpence a bunch -

Wind-wounds, spasms from the dark earth,
With their odourless metals,
A flamy purification of the deep grave's stony cold
As if ice had a breath -

We sold them, to wither.
The crop thickened faster than we could thin it.
Finally, we were overwhelmed
And we lost our wedding-present scissors.

Every March since they have lifted again
Out of the same bulbs, the same
Baby-cries from the thaw,
Ballerinas too early for music, shiverers
In the draughty wings of the year.
On that same groundswell of memory, fluttering
They return to forget you stooping there
Behind the rainy curtains of a dark April,
Snipping their stems.

But somewhere your scissors remember. Wherever they are.
Here somewhere, blades wide open,
April by April
Sinking deeper
Through the sod - an anchor, a cross of rust.

your legs grow weary

after hours of standing,

aching in stillness.

    .

peering towards the ground,

cracking powdery red clay

all that you can see.

    .

do you start to walk?

to where? in what direction?

more like erection.

    .

you are naked now,

with legs crossed, indian style.

smoking a peace pipe.

    .

the pipe becomes cocks.

intoxicated, you breathe-

inhaling the dick.

    .

time is meaningless.

only weiners have value

in this barren hell.

    .

**chapter four: the awakening.**

jolted awake, you frantically assess your new surroundings. winged softies flutter above you, diving, flapping, flaccid into a river of cum. you walk to the rivers edge. how long have you been asleep? a millennium has passed, and the salesman's teste-vomit has nourished the plains. the stream flows strong, winding across the open field. deer with branching hardons for antlers frolic. playfully butting heads, the penises collide, 10 at a time, smacking and wet. ""good thing balls aren't touching,"" you ponder to yourself- ""that would be gay.""

in your path is a fruit bearing bush. once peeled, the sticky skin and winding hairs give way to a meaty berry. starving, you eat from the bush and drink from the river. in the distance, there looms a great machine. revitalized, you trot curiously in its direction.

334,"A few years ago, when I was living in a small (20'x20') cottage, and was sick with mono (could barely move), I heard something fluttering around the floor, that looked black.  Great, a bat got in, I thought.  Then, I heard another one.  And another.  And another.

I finally got up the strength to hunt one down, and it turned out to be a bird.  Very stupid and docile, I was able to pick it up and toss them outside.  I looked it up, and found ""[Chimney Swift](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimney_Swift).""  Taking a peek up my chimney flu, I saw hundreds of them.  D'oh.

They're birds that like to hang inside chimneys, very bat-like and a bit creepy.  I guess some bad weather altered their migratory patterns and they hit our area, and my chimney.

I ended up pulling a branch from my old Christmas tree up through the chimney, creating a massive flock of birds around me that took off to the horizon.  (Again, it took every ounce of strength I had, having mono.  Ugh.)

I wasn't bothered by them again.  I lived there year round, but I heard that the next spring, when a neighboring cottage owner opened up his place, inside it was littered end-to-end with dead swifts.  D'oh.",2009-10-15 11:35:32

i think this has nothing to do with valuing life, per se, but with the fact that most get through life by veiling its realities from their view...and suicides flutter those veils uncomfortably...

i sympathize with the desire to protect angst ridden teenagers from offing themselves--their angst almost invariably stems from an unhealthy obsession with how others relate and validate them, which almost all of us eventually outgrow...however, adult suicides are a horse of an entirely different color--they don't seek to escape pain, but futility. anyone of reasonable intelligence struggles at least somewhat with the absurdity of rolling their rock up the hill for all eternity only to have it repeatedly roll back down again (and the human life span is eternity for human beings)--what keeps most from contemplating death as the escape is their sense obligation and responsibility for others in their life--children, spouses, pets--along with the multitude of methods they employ daily to dull their senses to keep from noticing it all--alcohol, drugs, god...not their love affair with life so much...",2009-10-15 18:01:41

347,"Supersonic angels! What a world that would be! Then I did some thinking about the aerodynamics of such a supersonic angel.

Winglets are no problem; [this picture of an eagle in glide](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Haliaeetus_leucocephalus7_%28softeis%29.jpg) shows an eagle's primary flight feathers in an upturned configuration, similar to a winglet. That's variable geometry, as well, so the 'winglets' could be stowed to a horizontal position for supersonic flight. I don't know what winglets would do in the supersonic  regime (current winglets are designed for the transonic regime), but as I recall they're susceptible to [aerodynamic flutter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeroelastic_flutter#Flutter) which can be catastrophic.

Area ruling an angel would be a little more problematic. For aesthetic reasons, I'm imagining a female angel, a [really hot one](http://www.fashionrat.com/images/adriana-lima-angel1.jpg). In that case, you wouldn't want to attach the wings near the shoulder blades, as normally depicted, because then the increased cross-sectional area of the wings would have to be balanced by a decrease in the cross-sectional area of the 'fuselage', or bust region of the torso. That's obviously no good.

Then, the solution! A swept wing makes a better [supercritical airfoil](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercritical_airfoil). Simply sweep the angel's wings backward and much of the wing's cross-sectional area is moved back near the waist, so the angel simply keeps a trim figure, and she's got high-speed aerodynamics.

354,"You could give Seneca's Epistuale Morales a try, more than half of the letters he wrote deal with death or rather fear of death and it can be a quite eye opening read.

Or just philosophy as a whole for that matter. I'm an agnostic myself and find it quite soothing and in a lot of ways even superior in that matter to religion (though this will of course differ from person to person). But it's more effective to base ones solace upon rational arguments instead of hope and faith for something in the future. Except, of course, if you take comfort in just having hope and if your hope/faith is without doubts, though i don't think this could apply to you, given you're an agnostic.

Anyways, here's an excerpt from Senecas 101. letter to give you a taste. Though you should read them all to get a better understanding of the matter.


&gt; We plan distant voyages and long-postponed 
&gt; home-comings after roaming over foreign shores, we 
&gt; plan for military service and the slow rewards of 
&gt; hard campaigns, we canvass for governorships ^ and the 
&gt; promotions of one office after another  and all the 
&gt; while death stands at our side ; but since we never 
&gt; think of it except as it affects our neighbour, instances 
&gt; of mortality press upon us day by day, to remain in 
&gt; our minds only as long as they stir our wonder. 
&gt; 
&gt; Yet what is more foolish than to wonder that some- 
&gt; thing which may happen every day has happened 
&gt; on any one day ? There is indeed a limit fixed 
&gt; for us, just where the remorseless law of Fate has 
&gt; fixed it ; but none of us knows how near he is to 
&gt; this limit. Therefore, let us so order our minds as 
&gt; if we had come to the very end. Let us postpone 
&gt; nothing. Let us balance life's account every day. 
&gt; The greatest flaw in life is that it is always imperfect, 
&gt; and that a certain part of it is postponed. One who 
&gt; daily puts the finishing touches to his life is never in 
&gt; want of time. And yet, from this want arise fear 
&gt; and a craving for the future which eats away the 
&gt; mind. There is nothing more wretched than worry 
&gt; over the outcome of future events ; as to the amount 
&gt; or the nature of that which remains, our troubled 
&gt; minds are set a-flutter with unaccountable fear. 
&gt; 
&gt; How, then, shall we avoid this vacillation ? In 
&gt; one way only,  if there be no reaching forward in 
&gt; our life, if it is withdrawn into itself. For he only is 
&gt; anxious about the future, to whom the present is 
&gt; unprofitable. But when I have paid my soul its 
&gt; due, when a soundly -balanced mind knows that a day 
&gt; differs not a whit from eternity  whatever days or 
&gt; problems the future may bring  then the soul looks 
&gt; forth from lofty heights and laughs heartily to itself 
&gt; when it thinks upon the ceaseless succession of the 
&gt; ages. For what disturbance can result from the 
&gt; changes and the instability of Chance, if you are 
&gt; sure in the face of that which is unsure ? 
&gt; 
&gt; Therefore, my dear Lucilius, begin at once to live, 
&gt; and count each separate day as a separate life. He 
&gt; who has thus prepared himself, he whose daily life 
&gt; has been a rounded whole, is easy in his mind ; but 
&gt; those who live for hope alone find that the immediate 
&gt; future always slips from their grasp and that greed 
&gt; steals along in its place, and the fear of death, a curse

374,"&gt; Yup. Definitely need to use my imagination more rather than redditting at work, redditting on the bus, and redditting at home. Also, I've never read Harry Potter or Twilight ;-)

Well, considering that we exclusively communicate with writing here, I think that it's not mutually exclusive. There is so much life around here, from AMA to AskReddit, and elsewhere from non-fiction on how the Mars Rover was built together to fiction that spans the end of the universe in Asimov's Last Question or the adventures of Edmond Dantes that there is hardly any need to resort to such recent pedestrian interpretations of entrepreneurial writing. However, the Harry Potter series deserves indubitably the honours it received.

&gt; Do you have any advice for not freaking out about showing other people your writing? :-D

Why? Colour me curious in the possibility of your admitting you've written something freak out worthy.

Anyway, can't be worse than this, and I was able to post this epic failure of a paragraph that's gone soggy due to its completely excessive cheesiness quite readily:

And such the hug was like. It is to painfully sweet a thing to ever want to oppose. But it could hurt like a glass being half-full and the addition of a single drop would, despite the level therein not changing visibly, cause it to shatter in slow motion into a million pieces. With five of those shards digging themselves into his heart and just seeing it happen would cause a lasting lump in the top of his chest. As the softness of her sweater would press against the firmness of his shirt, creating a mix of cotton scratching together. He pushed his hands against the top of her back and he could feel the warmth of his hands being placed on the intricately woven pattern of her sweater. As his head moved closer, he brushed against her hair and could feel it itching near his ear as it rushed past. He could feel her breath moisten the air around his neck, causing the hairs on his skin to tickle and ever so slightly melt together, despite his muscles being tensed to form goosebumps. His cheek didn't touch hers, but the necks met right at the spot where the hair is on the side, yet still as far back as possible. Her long hairs meeting his felt like two river streams merging and feeling just as smooth, as the gaps in her hair interlocked with the ones in his. They pressed their necks together, and as they did, they could feel the particles left over conditioner in each others hair smoothing the motion. At this point in time, he was overcome by her perfume and almost collapsed as it reached the top of his nose, the effect being amplified by him breathing in so deeply at right this time, and as he exhaled, his chest fell down and into her bosom and folded the sweater covering it. As he took his next breath, his mouth opened just a little wider and his top eyelids fluttered as he screwed his eyes upwards, his body being enveloped in such transquility that she could feel the fluttering of his eyelids through his chest of his slightly shiver-filled attempt to breathe in as her delicate figure rested in his arms.",2009-11-02 11:00:31

 - ""... a little boy, a little girl""

 - ""and thus nor i nor you did see...""

 - ""my love for you - and yours with mine...""

 - ""the why for which...""

sound nice. Sure, you could contract each of these into a shorter phrase, but the elliptical structure and alliteration in them makes them, I think, soft sounding to the ear, especially because something in elliptical structure like that is read out loud slightly more quickly, giving the idea of a flutter of a heartbeat - which makes even more sense, I think, because iambic reminds one of a heartbeat anyway (baBUM baBUM).  You two definitely have a good point, though; the issue shall be revisited and inspected closely.

388,"&gt;Libertarians are, by definition, douchebags. If you don't realize that, you probably need to grow up.
&gt;I agree, A_pickle is probably 13 or 14 and needs a few years to grow up. I will be patient.

Pot calling the kettle black, man.

Libertarians certainly aren't the douchebags that Republicans are, which was really the crux of my point.  You seem to have mis-interpreted my rather small, seemingly harmless comment as ""I AM A LIBERTARIAN AND WISH FEWER LIBERTARIANS WERE DOUCHEBAGS SO THAT YOU ALL WOULD BECOME LIBERTARIANS.""  Generally speaking, I am able to engage in intelligent, lively discussions with people on reddit (and I don't subscribe to the boy-who-cried-wolf whines of ""reddit is the new Digg!  Unintelligence abounds!  Woe is me!"").

Unfortunately, it seems like personal attacks have been resorted to moments into the discussion.  I'm asking myself why I bother to respond, but because I feel like the discussion can be salvaged and continued civilly.

Hardcore Libertarians, I would agree, are douchebags.  The over-infatuation with the pure free market suckered me in for all of about four months... then the healthcare debate began and there's no disputing that ""the free market"" hasn't cured cancer and caused rays of sunshine with colorful butterflies fluttering by.  Typically, this argument is responded to with, *""But we don't have a REAL free market!""* which, to me, sounds about as compelling an argument as *""Communism only failed to work because the wrong people were in charge!""*

Sorry, I don't buy it.

What I DO buy, however, is the general Ron Paul Libertarianism (yeah, I know he's obsessed with the free market, and I disagree with his vehement anti-regulatory stances there).

* Make friends, not war - and cease interventionism.
* Keep government's budget balanced.
* Exercise government to protect individual liberties (and, to this end) remove government from consentual contracts between two parties.
* Eliminate central banks and government intervention in monetary policy.

If it weren't for the recent and sudden appreciation of Libertarian ideals, Americans wouldn't be talking seriously about the legalization of marijuana.  Ron Paul's campaign in 2008 pulled that view from the ""unrealistic lunatic fringe"" to a position that more and more Americans, by the day, are realizing *simply makes sense*.  Democrats certainly weren't doing anything -- even when Obama's own change.gov website listed the legalization of marijuana as THE top issue for Americans, he dismissed it.  As for Republicans doing anything for the legalization of marijuana?  You know just as well as I do the utter hopelessness of that party vote on that issue.

How and why you get upvotes for your, frankly, unkind comments blows my mind.  How my comment got downvoted is even more unbelievable.  Okay, Lib-o-Reddit, keep the Republicans as the opposing party... lemme know how that goes for you.",2009-11-08 07:09:02

He pleads in vain for his life as Amir's sobbing family curses at him from behind the window. The red phone hangs silent as each second fades away, Streeter watching the clock as the hands approach midnight. He screams at the ceiling, that it was all just a joke and that it went too far. It went too fucking far, God, *too fucking far.*

The thin black sticks meet at twelve and Streeter is resigned to accepting his death. All visible emotion drains from his face as his tear-stained cheeks dry under the heat of the light bulbs above. Acceptance is short-lived, his crime a lie. *""Why?""*, he asks a god who refuses to listen; *""Why don't they see it was just a joke? Why doesn't College Humour show them the other videos? Why don't they show them the baseball game?! WHY GOD, WHY?!""*

The doctor turns around, piercing black eyes aimed at Streeter's own. ""Patient exhibits signs of dementia,"" he exclaims to an aide. ""Do we continue with execution?"" The aide nods without speaking, and the doctor leans in toward Streeter.

Streeter looks up at the doctor, a middle-aged Latino man with a puzzled look, and asks weakly why his workmates don't save him. The doctor leans closer, shadowing Streeter's quivering mouth and forcing him to swallow the lump that was forming in his throat. ""Michael, what is College Humour?"", he asks Streeter. ""My name i-is St-streeter..."", responds the young black man restrained at his arms and legs; ""I..I write c-comedy for a website.""

""No, Michael. Your name is not Streeter"", he says solemnly, his head shaking in disapproval. ""Why do you think you're here, Michael?"".

IT WAS A FUCKING JOKE!"", he screams as the veins in his neck erupt. The doctor wipes saliva off his glasses and onto his coat, resting his left hand on Streeter's sweat-soaked forehead. ""Michael, there was no Amir. There was a no prank war. Sleep now, child, and may God have mercy on your soul.""

Streeter rests his right cheek on the padded table, tears forming miniature rivers over the ridge of his nose that cascade onto a small pillow.

    And all the folk in tears at sight of her. 
    With a dumb terror and a sinking knee 
    She dropped; nor might avail her now that first 
    'Twas she who gave the king a father's name. 
    They raised her up, they bore the trembling girl 
    On to the altar- hither led not now 
    With solemn rites and hymeneal choir, 
    But sinless woman, sinfully foredone, 
    A parent felled her on her bridal day, 
    Making his child a sacrificial beast 
    To give the ships auspicious winds for Troy: 
    Such are the crimes to which Religion leads.

415,"Whenever Richard Cory went down town,

We people on the pavement looked at him:

He was a gentleman from sole to crown,

Clean-favoured and imperially slim.



And he was always quietly arrayed,

And he was always human when he talked;

But still he fluttered pulses when he said,

""Good Morning!"" and he glittered when he walked.



And he was rich, yes, richer than a king,

And admirably schooled in every grace:

In fine -- we thought that he was everything

To make us wish that we were in his place.



So on we worked and waited for the light,

And went without the meat and cursed the bread,

And Richard Cory, one calm summer night,

Went home and put a bullet in his head. ",2009-11-17 03:15:37
416,"Yes, it is possible to learn how to listen.  It's just like anything else, the more time you spend on it, the better you get. IMO playing an instrument is about listening more than anything else, but you can do it even without ears.  Here's something to try:  play the adjacent notes you spoke about at the same time, loud.  You should hear something that does not sound pleasing and feel a very fast flutter (especially if you are in physical contact with the piano).  This is called the [""beat"" frequency](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beat_frequency), and it is what most musicians use to tune their instruments.

Plus, even if they could attend all of Glenn Beck's rallies, they probably don't want to end up on national television holding an Obama=Nazi sign if they want to keep their jobs or their clients.  No, going to these angrier than hell rallies is the past-time of the retired.

424,"What do you mean by ""free""? As in, originating not from any outside influence? If that's the case, how are they directed at all?

You might say that, yes, when I'm thirsty and see a cup of water, my thirst, which is a consequence of my physical body and outside my control, does influence me, but I am free to either drink or not drink. 

But I advance that whatever you *ultimately* do is not a ""free"" decision, as it too is simply the aggregate of billions of competing forces in the *computing machinery* of your brain. You had the illusion of being able to  choose one action or another, but you chose only one. And if we were to rewind the clock to the moment before you made your decision and watch things unfold again, the action would be repeated down to the tiniest twitch of the corner of your mouth, the most minute flutter of a single eyelash, the most anonymous, indetectable squirm of a skin cell. How could it not?

Follow me here: you would surely agree that the physical medium a thought process is carried out in matters little. You would not be bothered by an alien species with brains of silicon, just as you would agree that the mind of a mosquito or a rat is like yours in some primitive way in that it is a machine which performs computation and interacts with a physical body.

And you have no problem admitting for example that the mind of a computer process, the mind of an amoeba, the mind of a virus or dust mite, is deterministic. It's easy for us to say this because of how simplistic they are.

And as you said, the mind of a human being is not deterministic.

Now I ask you, at what point in the continuum between the simplistic mind of a dust mite and the slightly more complicated mind of a human being (when you think of how powerful a computer could be in theory, you realize that we're a lot closer than human ""dignity"" (read: vanity) would admit.) -- where along this continuum does the computing machinery, due to its level of sophistication, free itself from the causal chain in which all physical matter is a part?

Another way to look at it is, you would have no trouble admitting that a single atom in your brain is bound by physical law. No doubt you would also be willing to extend this to 2 atoms. What property does the soggy wet mass of your brain have that when assembled in just the right way, it is able to transcend physical law?",2009-11-22 18:55:59

428,"**""Best Story"" #1 -- The DNR lady**

We got a call that an 80-year old female had been vomiting blood all day and her nursing home wanted her taken to the ER (After we spoke to the staff we found out she had been puking blood since 8am, but they didn't call for us until 4pm because she was DNR.)

I spoke to her in her bed, and asked how she was feeling, and she told me she was a bit nauseous, but otherwise OK.  We transferred her onto our cot and brought her out to our rig.  As we were loading her in, I saw her eyes flutter and her mouth drop open.  I jumped into the ambulance to check her pulse and respirations, and they were both barely audible.  As I was grabbing her chart to get her details, a nurse told me she had a DNR order on file (DNR = Do Not Resuscitate) so there was nothing we could do to try to save her.  We called back to base to see what they wanted us to do, and we were told to transfer her to the hospital, lights but no sirens, and turn her over to the M.E.

It was a 10 minute ride to the ER, and my partner was driving.  I had no professional responsibilities to keep this woman alive, so my role was relegated to keeping her warm and holding her hand while she died.  And let me tell you: Watching someone go from freshly dead to 10 minutes past dead is **fascinating**.

Within 30 seconds of the ambulance doors shutting, the color started to drain from her face, starting at the forehead and progressing to the chin.  I took her pulse throughout, and felt her neck get colder and colder as her heart rate gradually reduced to zero.  She was still for 2-3 more minutes and then....the death rattle.

It was as forceful as someone normally exhaling, with a background of cracking sounds and what sounded like creaking wood emanating from her lips for 8-10 seconds.  I was checking her respiration at the time of the death rattle and I caught a full-on whiff on what was in her belly.  It was a terrible smell...much like what you would expect dried blood and death to smell like...and I turned away immediately, but was in awe of what I had experienced.  A very unique opportunity indeed.

We arrived at the hospital, unloaded her and she was pronounced dead in the ER.  She was just one elderly woman who died of natural causes, but watching her die is an experience that taught me a ton about what happens to the body immediately after life has departed and I am very grateful to have witnessed this.",2009-11-26 01:05:58
429,"So let me get this straight... the whole of your evidence that the bailout has had a positive effect is your completely subjective comparison of the events of the last few months to the events immediately preceding the Great Depression, and the events immediately following the onset of the Great Depression. These events, which you claim this bailout averted, are:

* Banks failing
* People losing money when the banks failed
* Unemployment skyrocketing following bank failure

I'm speechless. Have you not noticed that all of these things have happened? Have you not noticed that ""official"" unemployment is in the double digits, while ""unofficial"" unemployment is fluttering around 20 percent? Have you not noticed the HURRY UP AND DO SOMETHING DON'T WASTE THE CRISIS mentality and the promises made by this ""team"" have bought us nothing but a tanking currency, ballooning unemployment, a disillusioned populace, and a half dozen major companies which are effectively nationalized... for one trillion dollars we simply do not have?

But you know what, we'll just ignore all that for the moment. The fact of the matter is, your proof consists entirely of: ""I read about the Great Depression some, and now I feel qualified and knowledgeable enough on the subject to state, with no hard or empirical evidence whatsoever, that the largest spending bill in the history of government has succeeded in the face of all the problems... just cause. Just cause I think so.""

Unless you have a high level degree or a vast wealth of experience in the realm of economics, or access to some sort of data which none of the rest of us are privy to, you're utterly unqualified to make such an assessment, let alone attempt to argue it out based on what seems to me little more than intuition and gusto. All this accomplishes is to add to the echo chamber and perpetuate the idea that bad policy and stupid decision making will work if we just believe hard enough and keep smiling and assuring ourselves that good intentions, pretty words and fluffy feelings are all we need if we want to solve our problems.

Voiceless it cries,
Wingless flutters,
Toothless bites,
Mouthless mutters.

Cannot be heard, cannot be smelt.
It lies behind stars and under hills,
And empty holes it fills.
It comes first and follows after,

Alive without breath,
As cold as death;
Never thirsty, ever drinking,
All in mail never clinking.

Birds, beasts, trees, flowers;
Gnaws iron, bites steel;
Grinds hard stones to meal;
Slays king, ruins town
And beats high mountain down.

First they champ,
Then they stamp,
Then they stand still.

Dear Diary,

Do you remember my entries from 5/23/09, 8/2/09 and 9/14/09? They have all come true. Today a reddit admin replied to one of my comments! Did you hear me, diary? *A reddit admin*. Can you believe it? But that's not the best part of the story. Are you ready for it? It was jedberg that made the comment. *jedberg*. There are very few names on this earth that make my heart flutter when I see them printed before me. This is one of them, diary. Raldi is great and a fantastic admin I'm sure, but to see the one and only jedberg single out my comment for response...it was as if a rainbow had sprouted from my laptop screen and hit me straight in the eyes. 

If only you could read his reply, my leather-bounded friend. His words were graceful and tact, direct yet gentle. I may have even sensed some jealousy that I dedicated my first reddit diary entry to karmanaut. I don't think that could be the case however, because jedberg has one thing that karmanaut lacks: the scarlet A. A proclamation that he is jedberg, ruler of all things reddit. A declaration that his comment has weight and significance in the grand scheme of things. A sign that....oh my, I must stop myself diary, I'm becoming quite flustered. Guess what else, diary? He even gave me an ASCII smiley! You know what that means, don't you diary? Oh of course you do, you know me so well.

And to think, now I can give *him* an orangered envelope, sent from my inbox to his! Oh to be a fly on the wall of his room, to see his reaction when he reads this entry. Do you think he will smile in delight and laugh at my childish reddit romance? Or do you think he will look upon me as 'just another user', thrown into the throngs of other jedberg fanatics. Only time will tell diary. Only time will tell.

Until we meet again,

That probably doesn't help the OP, as losing the sensor to open the door would make the specialty door useless, but I thought I'd add it just in case another pet owner sees this and thinks twice about putting a collar on their pet. I'd recommend a collar and an ID tag for any pet that goes outdoors.

As for the cat peeing in the house, if he used to use a litter box, it could be that he either doesn't like the brand of litter now being used, or he doesn't like where the litter box is placed. If he is regularly urinating in one spot, or a couple of spots, try moving the litter box(s) there. If he never used a litter box, I'm not sure. I've seen grass patches for indoor dogs to use but I doubt a cat would fall for that.

There is a brilliant flash of light and thunder booms loudly, echoing off of the buildings around us, deafening. I turn around towards the source of the light.

Two young, strangely dressed men stand inside, beckoning to me.

There was a new girl in our class, by the name of Amanda. She was mentally retarded, not too seriously, but enough to know just by the sound of her voice. We were in the midst of the wholly-awesome badminton unit (that, and fencing, are the only two real sports in *my* book) and someone was cruel enough to tell Amanda that I thought she was cute. I dunno if they were trying to be mean to me or her, but either way, it was mean. So Amanda takes this to be the truth and starts fluttering her eyelashes at me, strutting her stuff, etc. I try to be polite but not encourage the behavior, but it's difficult, and she doesn't take the hint.

The behavior continues; she follows me between classes, at recess, at lunch, everywhere. She tries to get my number but I know that it would be a pretty bad idea to give it to her. Finally, one day after a particularly rousing game of badminton, as we waited for the bell to ring, she approaches me and says, ""hey jake do you want to go out with me?"" to which I responded ""I don't think I'm really ready for a relationship right now, Amanda. 

Her eyes filled with tears and she looked at my for a moment before quietly asking, ""*is it because im retarded?*"" Hearing that pretty much broke my heart. I immediately stammered out some reply about how no, it wasn't; it was because I'm too young for a relationship and I don't really know her that well but I think we should definitely stay friends...

I still feel that in the pit of my stomach whenever I think about it.

She continued to follow me, at lunch, all the time throughout middle school and into my sophomore year. She could even get away with following me to my classes because teachers wouldn't get her in trouble with being late for class. Finally, one day she approached me, once more with tears in her eyes. She told me she was moving away, to Arizona, and that she would never see me again but would always love me.

In a ""proper"" pushup, the chest (just) touches the floor.  The PAST guidelines only say that the elbows must bend &lt;90.  I can see how someone could get in more reps by doing the pushups strategically, and not using the full range of motion.

For flutter kicks - what is the closest your descending leg was allowed to come to the ground (without touching)?

452,"The title of your thread shows that you are already halfway to your goal. You at least understand there is a silver lining. Most people go through life and when something they don't enjoy happens, they say ""Balderdash! This sucks, life sucks, screw it all!"". They see an unpleasant situation as bad. They are dependent on their emotions, their ego. 

At the most basic level, there is sadness and great suffering in all the world and we all experience it, we are all subject to its torture. But the only reason you feel physical pain or emotional anguish is your attachment to these physical things. If you had no attachment you would feel nothing, including physical pain. But this dissociation from the world is not what we want or need. No attachment is only for those who forsake humanity and yearn for their own moksha or release from bondage - I think a Buddha is selfish in a way, whereas a Boddhisatva knows honor and true compassion for his fellow humans (if you're not familiar with the difference between the two, wiki it!)

So you can't deny all of what makes you you, you cannot completely deny the ego - it can be a good thing. Your love for those around you is a good thing (though it is ego). And your sadness now is a reflection of the love you feel for your father, for your family. It is integral to you. Just like reddit has a karma system, so does the world. What we in the west think of as karma, however, is not what karma really is. Karma is balance on all scales. It is balance between two people, it is balance between two nations, it is balance between any and all things, and it is always present. Balance is essential. Good happens, bad happens, things happen objectively, but you choose subjectively whether it is good or bad.

I always used to argue with a friend about whether the universe is flawed, or perfect. It can only be one or the other, on a whole. If the universe is flawed, there can be no perfection. If the universe is perfect, their can be no flaws. But consider that perhaps there is only perfection. A flaw is lack of perfection. But there is nothing but perfection, there is no flaw to be perfected. Say the universe is flawed. Then there can be no perfection. But without perfection to define what it is to be flawed, there can be no flaw in the universe.

So you choose whether the universe is perfect or flawed. It's really up to you. It's entirely up to you. 

A couple years ago, I was a very sickly person. I always got the bacterial infections in my throat, sinuses, and stomach. I'd go to the doctor, he'd do the culture and I'd take antibiotics. After meditating one day, I decided that I had control over my body and that I was not going to get sick any more. Whenever I get a headache, I will it to go away. Whenever I get a sore throat, I imagine a healing light falling on me, I envision and create a healing light. I will visualize germs getting sacked by my white blood cells, cleansing my body and lifting my spirits. And I feel great! Maybe it is in my head, but so are all my thoughts and emotions, and they are valid. And I feel better, I don't need medicine, I don't need a doctor. When you have a thought or an emotion, maybe you are overjoyed, perhaps you are depressed, the thought itself happens first. Something wholly intangible and unfindable, a ghost in your machine, flutters about through your consciousness for a few brief moments, and then a neurotransmitter chemical is produced. A few molecules of dopamine and endorphins are biosynthesized and lock into your receptors. But the key is that the thought comes first, then transforms from nothingness into a physical chemical.

The point is that you have control over it all. Emotions are not bad. They are what make you human. Embrace sadness for what it is, a sign of your love for your father and those around you. And make the absolute best of everything in your life. Shit happens, someimtes it sucks and everybody around you will think that you are one pitiful, unfortunate person. But even though they think your life sucks, only you decide what it is and is not.",2009-12-07 04:03:46

459,"    Once upon a term'nal dreary, while I hack'ed, weak and weary,
    Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten code--
    While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a beeping,
    As of some one gently feeping, feeping using damn talk mode.
    ""'Tis some hacker,"" I muttered, ""beeping using damn talk mode--
    Only this. I hate talk mode.""
    
    Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak semester,
    And college life wrought its terror as the school year became a bore.
    Eagerly I wished for privledges;--higher access I sought to borrow
    For my term'nal, unceasing sorrow--sorrow for a file called core--
    For the rare and radiant files of .c the coders call the core--
    Access Denied. Chown me more.
    
    ""Open Source,"" did all mutter, when, with very little flirt and flutter,
    In there stepped a stately Penguin of the saintly days of yore.
    Quite a bit obese was he; having eaten lots of fish had he,
    But, by deign of Finnish programmer, he sat in the middle of my floor--
    Looking upon my dusty term'nal in the middle of my floor--
    Came, and sat, and nothing more.
    
    Then the tubby bird beguiling my sad code into shining,
    By the free and open decorum of the message that it bore,
    ""Though thy term'nal be dusty and slow,"" he said, ""Linux be not craven!""
    And thus I installed a new OS far from the proprietary shore--
    The kernel code open but documentation lacking on this shore.
    Quoth the Penguin, ""pipe grep more!""
    
    Much I marvelled this rotund fowl to hear discourse so plainly,
    Though its answer little meaning--little relevancy bore;
    For we cannot help believing that no living human being
    Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird in the middle of his floor--
    Bird or beast sitting in the middle of his cluttered floor,
    With such instructions as ""pipe grep more.""
    
    But the Penguin, sitting lonely in that cluttered floor, spoke only
    Those words, as if its soul in that instruction he did outpour.
    Nothing more did he need utter; understood did I among that clutter--
    Understood his command as I could scarcely do a few moments before--
    I typed as furious as was willed me, understanding just a minute before.
    Again the bird said ""pipe grep more!""
    
    ""Amazing!"" said I, ""Penguin we will conquor the world if you will!
    By the Network that interconnects us--by that Finn we both adore--
    We'll take this very world by storm!"" For now grasped I what he'd meant,
    The thing I do while searching /usr/doc/* for that wond'rous lore--
    Those compendiums of plaintext documentation and descriptive lore.
    Quoth the Penguin, ""pipe grep more!""
    
    And the Penguin, never waddling, still is sitting, still is sitting
    In the middle of my room and still very cluttered floor;
    And his eyes have all the seeming of the free beer I am drinking
    And the term'nal-light o'er him glowing throws his shadows on the floor;
    And this OS from out the shadows that is pow'ring my term'nal on the floor
    Shall be dominating--""Pipe grep more!"" ",2009-12-12 03:48:04

You get your money from a trust fund put in place by a relative that believed music to be the source of all evil, and one stipulation for getting the money is that you cannot spend it on music.  You don't listen to music. There's only one place in your remote mountain town that has tea and it is impossible to order a package of it to your house because your home is guarded by fierce yetis.

465,"The government is conducting experiments in which parrots can be trained to correct spelling errors.  Their accuracy is several orders of magnitude better than the best software spell checkers, and researchers are exploring ways to train songbirdswho have the innate ability to recognize recursive ""grammars"" in songsto apply their talent to correcting grammatical errors in human languages as well.

These endeavors derive from a Cold War military project, code name W.A.R.B.L.E., a major effort to train birds to detect and reveal foreign spies both at home and abroad.  Pigeons were the most promising candidates, as they are common throughout the world's major cities, and as such, their presence on a window ledge would not be noticed the way an exotic and colorful toucan would.

From the late '50s through the early '70s, the Pentagon funded several propaganda efforts to subliminally lull the public into ignoring the sudden appearance of large flocks of unusually intelligent birds, some of which might occasionally make warbling noises that uncannily resemble human language.

This effort funded the creation of several popular songs of the era, such as ""(Have You  Heard) The Bird's the Word"", ""Rockin' Robin"", and ""(They Long To Be) Close To You"", which famously asked and answered the question, ""Why do birds suddenly appear?"", but deliberately omitted any reflection as to *why* those birds might seek physical proximity, nor is there any explanation of how they were able to unerringly home in on their unsuspecting targets.

The USSR made several clandestine attempts at counterpropaganda, including the 1963 suspense film *The Birds*, directed by Soviet sleeper agent Nastya Anatolyevna Golubev, who had been working under the fabricated alias ""Alfred Hitchcock"" ever since an accidental underdose of the East German Olympic swim team's ""secret tonic"" stunted the development of her testes, leaving her with a corpulent, quasi-masculine appearance.

Development of *The Birds* was funded in Hollywood, an American city which at the time was under Communist control.

Golubev/Hitchcock's efforts continued until her mysterious death in 1980, while working on *The Short Night*, a spy film which sought to portray American secret agents as ruthless assassins.

By then, however, the damage had been done.  Golubev's propaganda films would guarantee that the public would never tolerate any ""bird brains"" fluttering about the corridors of power!

In 1985, a major public-relations flap ruffled some feathers in the loftiest perches of Washington's pecking order, and the hawks at the Pentagon decided that the project's eggheads were a bunch of quacks.  By winter, the hawks' focus had migrated south, towards humanitarian efforts to aid the struggling freedom fighters nested in Iran and Nicaragua.  Although the government would never again have egg on its face, it was to be Project W.A.R.B.L.E.'s swan song.",2009-12-13 14:14:08

A lot of ducks and geese congregated there, and people would go down and feed them bread.

For as long as I could remember, there'd been a pair of swans that lived in that pond.  Swans are pretty territorial and they mate for life.  These two were pretty accepting of the other birds that made their temporary residence at the pond, I'd never seen them be fierce towards anyone / anything, but I'd also never seen them when they had chicks.

Anyhow, we were sitting there, eating our Big Macs, watching the swans when one of them suddenly started making a horrific sound.  A throaty squawk that sounded urgent and pained.  It's neck started contorting around in very unnatural ways, it's wings fluttering uselessly.  It's mate was going batshit, squawking and making a big fuss, totally helpless.

Finally, the big bird's head convulsed one last time, and it's neck bent in half and came to a rest against the stones on the bank of the pond.  It's mate, honest-to-god, sounded like he was crying.

Luke took up the chase, trying to grab the towel.  Leia whipped him as they ran.  Luke tried got a hold of the towel and tried to pull it away, but Leia wouldn't release her grip.  They wrestled over the towel yanking back and forth, Leia fell onto the bed and Luke fell on top of her.

He tried to pin her to the bed, but she continued to struggle.  

""I have something very serious-"" Luke stopped, noticing Leia's glistening body, still wet from the shower.  Her hair was wet, and tossled.  Her towel had slipped some during the struggle, revealing more cleavage.  His eyes met Leia's and they locked.

Leia could feel Luke's eyes looking over her body.  When their eyes locked, she sat their looking at him, expectantly.

Luke bent down and kissed Leia.

He immediately turned bright red, and turned away, and got up off of her. Leia got up, following Luke.  

Luke turned to apologize, ""Sorry I don't-""

Leia kissed him, hard.

Luke grabbed her, and held her tightly against his body.  He could taste the excitement on her breath, could see the desire in her flushed face.

""I've wanted you for so long."" Luke said between gasping kisses.

""I've always wanted you too."" Leia said.

Leia slipped her off Luke's shirt, and undid his belt.  She led him gently to the bed.

Luke stopped, ""we can't do this.  We are brother and sister.  This is wrong.""

Leia slipped her hand into Luke's pants.  ""It seems like you aren't entirely sure on that matter.""

Luke's face felt as though it might burst into flames.

""Here, do you want a little encouragement?""  Leia slipped Luke's pants down, he wasn't wearing any underwear (Jedi never do).

Before Luke could say another word, his manhood was in his sister's mouth.  

Luke laid back, in ecstasy.  She knew what she was doing.  

The momentum was building, and Luke couldn't take anymore.

He could feel the energy of the dark side flowing through him, lust led only to the dark side.

He picked her up using the Force, and sent the towel flying from her body.  He knocked over everything in the room, on accident, losing control with his lust.  He turned her around, and she positioned herself on all fours.

She looked back into Luke's eyes, watching him as he looked at her body.

""Take me."" she said.  ""Take me now.""

Though her own force senses were weaker than Luke's, she could still feel him through the force, still feel his emotions, his desire was overwhelming.  She knew he could feel her through the force as well.  They were connected.

Luke entered her and Leia gasped.

""It's so much bigger than it was a few seconds ago...""  She said.

Luke laughed, ""Size matters not.""

Luke grabbed her hips and thrust into her, again and again.  Fondling her breasts, and bending over for quick kisses.

Leia turned around and watch Luke work, his body hardened from Jedi training.  

Luke was getting excited, feeling her excitement and pleasure, and feeling himself through her.

""Oh god."" Leia gasped.  ""Oh god, cum in me please cum in me""

Soon, the force wasn't the only thing Leia could feel flowing through her.",2009-12-22 01:02:21

1) i was 11, picnic in the countryside, attacked by Meat bees from all sides. every time i clenched an arm or leg to escape a bite, there was one in the joint that would get trapped. ended up having to roll on the ground for ten minute to be free. swollen for a week. to this day whenever i see one the world turns red and i come to surrounded by their fluttering dewinged corpses.
2) ate some bad chicken, or some bad parts of a good chicken. Twenty minutes after a chicken crepe dinner, got an excruciating pain in my chest, kinda felt like i had swallowed a bone or my stomach acid was digesting everything but the food. lasted 3 days, during which i could not sleep more than 10 minutes at a time, because the only thing that made the sensation diminish was constant movement. had to roll and walk around, lie with my legs over my head, leaning over something, till it finally passed.

Hmm, from Star Trek: Captain Picard, and Captain Janeway. They can beam me up any day. Both are intellectuals, strong willed, and take guff from no one.

Star Wars: Princess Leia. Also kind of wanted to *be* her. Mon Mothma became a role model as I got older, despite her bit part in the films, she was quite an impressive leader. She was also quite cute in both the prequels and Return of the Jedi.

Roger Moore's James Bond. Yes, yes I know James Bond is incredibly, almost hilariously sexist, but it's grandfather claused from before my political awakening. Moore was just so... damn dashing, that cunning bastard.

Speaking of Roger Moore films, the titular character of Octopussy was also quite a formidable woman despite the stupidly unbelievable scenes where she was captured, bound and gagged. I'd have loved to have been one of her 'girls' on her island. ::coughs::

On the subject of Bond... Pierce Brosnan. He was like a blend of Timothy Dalton and Roger Moore. ::purrs::

This is a bit more recent so it's not quite the same as a youthful crush but... Lily Rush from Cold Case. She's just plain inspiring. I do love a strong woman, same reason I crushed on Leia when I was younger.

Alan Rickman as anything.

Requisite Lord of the Rings crush? Eowyn.

That's all I can think of right now, at any rate.",2009-12-28 03:00:48
503,"Well, it's not much of a debate if we just shout out the bands we prefer. So how about some spirited talking?

**Number 1**
Looking back at when I was a kid and listening to a whole lot of 70's Floyd, I can see an interesting trend: I preferred the Wall as a 12 year old, full of rage and hormones and mixed emotions. I also adored the whole narrative structure of the album. As I got on a bit in years, I started to think it was on the whole too melodramatic and contrived, and I much preferred Dark Side of the Moon with all its star-gazing, caterwauling and interesting stylistic choices (like that weird little electric-blip breakdown after Breathe).

But, at the current point in time, I think they're both shite compared to the weird experimentalism and psychadelia of the Syd Barrett stuff. Listen to Arnold Layne, that's a great little gem. 

**Number 2**
The Clash were, as they said, the Only Band That Mattered. They were politically aware, lyrically astounding. Listen to the first self-titled record and it's still just as catchy and raw today, over 30 years on. In fact, I'm wary to buy the last Clash album I don't have (Sandinista) because I want there to be something left for the future. Every time I go a long spell between listens, and plonk down one of my old Clash records, I fall in love with it all over again.

The Pistols were very influential, and I respect them for that. But I think that John Lydon was the prime talent there, and he kicked way more ass in PIL. I get bored of Never Mind The Bollocks very quickly, although there's no denying the catchiness of Pretty Vacant.

So Clash win for me hands down. You don't always feel like giving the finger to EVERYONE, but I'm always ready to give the finger to fascists and tyrants, and Strummer's words are liberty's official soundtrack.

**Number 3**
I have to give my preference to Sgt. Pepper's. That album has real progression and charm, and there's not a track on it I want to skip (out of Mr. Kite perhaps). The record is just timeless, from the great theatrical opening to that jarring, smashing ending. In fact, I'd give it to SP just for Day in the Life.

**Numbers 4 and 5**
These two excellent match-ups belong together, as I have the exact same qualms in considering them. I LOVE The Kink's 60's stuff. Lola vs. Powerman? Incredibly catchy record. In the same vein, The Who's 60's stuff is always listenable, especially The Who Sell Out. But in the 70's, both bands went down the tubes for me. I'm sorry, but I just can't get behind Misfits, and I have a real hatred for the Who's melodramatic crap like Reign Over Me and Behind Blue Eyes and all that. Oddly enough, both bands started to splinter around the 80's if I remember right, breaking out into solo acts with mixed success.

Now, Zeppelin and the Stones, on the other hand, are not innocent or golden gods in comparison to the aforementioned groups. However, Zep's first four albums are INCREDIBLE. Perhaps it's only personal preference, but when I'm in a Zeppelin mood, I can listen to pretty much anything from their oeuvre (excluding In through the Out Door). The Stones, well, everything in the 60's and early 70's is pretty much perfect in my book. My personal favorite as of late is the weird, jangly, eclectic Satanic Majesty's Request. But their 70's output wasn't all bad, and I happen to enjoy Emotional Rescue.

In short, Kinks and Who started out so well but soured with success, whereas Zep and the Stones were more consistent (although I draw the line with the Stone's more recent material).

**Number 6**
Well, imagine a day in a young man's life. He's 19, and has just felt real pain for the first time, putting the last nails in the coffin of a painful, stagnate relationship.

He returns from her apartment, and turns his dormitory into a cave, wallowing in anger and self-imposed exile. Resolute to simply sit and ponder, he plays Kid A that night for the first time. As he sinks into the twin bed, the warm synthetic birth-notes of the first track gnaw into his brain like termites. He had listened to Radiohead, simmered and boiled to OK Computer, driven in a car and laughed with a girl to The Bends, vibrated with electricty to Hail to the Thief in his desk chair and headphones, but this was different. This time, he was taken, left in a seat in some kind of maniacal warehouse, and left under a light like a houseplant, bathed in warmth, swaying and stretching as the colors changed. He went from ecstasy to pitfalls of emptiness. He was like Eric in Warhol's Chelsea Girls; he couldn't feel anything at all, all he felt was him. As the fluttering harps built, and Thom sung about red wine and sleeping pills, he felt himself sinking lower and lower. The sheets swathed him in cotton arms. He closed his eyes. He had found a bit of peace.

**Number 7**
Uh, right... I don't really think they're on the same wavelength, to be honest. That's like asking me to pick between a Thanksgiving Dinner or a back massage. I will tell you one thing, though: I don't ever want to sit again in a hippie guitar circle by the beach, listening to a comely redhead mangle either group's work on her beat-up dreadnought.

**Number 8**
Velvet Underground. Sorry, I'm getting tired at this point.

**Number 9...number 9...number 9...**
Neutral Milk Hotel.

**Nummmmber 10**
Of course Dylan. Clapton is boring.

**Uhhhleven.**

504,"This actually happens a lot to me. I have low self esteem and that makes me sortof carefree in a conditioned helpessness kinda way and people mistaken that for confidence. I take a deep interest in people, especially when they take an interest in me. When I see the signs start to pop up that a dude is actually interested in me that way I ignore it or try to steer the conversation away. Probably because I'm both afraid to come off as cocky and am a shamless cocktease for flattery. I'm a very 'roll with it' type of person (to a point) and that probably comes off as shyness and dormant curiosity. Secretly though I'm just a cocktease for the flattery. I've never felt sexually aroused for another guy, but am somewhat comfortable with the idea of it being something thats natural and potentially within us all. Actually now that I think of it there was one guy who was very good looking, cool as fuck, that I do kinda have a man crush on, but not in a sexual way. More like a ""I want this dude in my pack"" type of feeling. Like, think of your favorite best friend in the world. Now picture them thinking about having sex with you. Sorta makes you think about it too. Now let the homophobia, fear and anxiety wash away. Then you start to think ""Did my dick just flutter?"" Then I watch gay porn for about 5 minutes to see if I can get an erection. It's too weird and as much as I try to relax theres just this block there. It's like trying to read chinese or get an erection off looking at a picture of a chair. Maybe one day I'll have one too many and some dude will polish me off behind a bar and I'll be able to know for sure. ",2009-12-29 10:36:40

510,"I thought about this in depth a while ago. Gameplay is what games are based around. Gameplay should be the first focus of a developer. 

First I thought about what sorts of gameplay exist today. I simplified the gameplay styles to what you control, not the genre. In games today we control: Point and click(adventure games), humanoid characters from a first person perspective, humanoid characters from a third person over the shoulder perspective, car-ish vehicles, flying vehicles, characters(or vehicles) from top-down 2d perspectives, characters(or vehicles) from a side 2d perspective(Mario, Super Smash Bros.), tycoon style games(Sim City, Zoo Tycoon, Roller Coaster Tycoon). Almost all games fit within these frequently used gameplay styles, and few developers can break out of it.

I started attempting to brainstorm ideas that do not fit within any of these categories. The only concept I remember that I thought of was controlling a bird. Most developers would take the easy way out and just use a pre-established gameplay concept for the bird's control. I had a concept where two buttons would control its wings. I pictured this on a console controller. The left shoulder trigger button could be used for short wing flaps, fluttering. So when the bird is approaching a landing the player could tap this button a couple of times to slow down their decent. The right trigger button would be used for larger flaps of the wings. This would be used to allow the player to build up speed to fly quickly. In fact, all the wing control could probably be simplified into one button. A tap for a shorter flap, a hold for a long powerful flap.

I flushed out this game idea more with other concepts, but most aren't as important as the general control. I wanted to try to make the player interact with the world the same way an animal such as a bird might, but at the same time I wanted the player to achieve things they felt were actual accomplishments. The bird itself would need to eat. Bushes would grow red berries which would be the birds food. The player would have to land on the bush and eat the large berries to regain energy. The player's energy would degrade slowly overtime, and if they were hurt it would degrade too. As the energy/health of the bird gets lower the non-important parts of the environment begin to fade into a monochromatic color scheme, and only the berries would keep color. This would highlight the importance of the food to the bird, and relate it in a way the player would understand.

A game about exploring and eating berries probably wouldn't appeal to many people though. I wanted to create a town that had two secretive factions in competition. You could help both factions by delivering notes, weapons, and various items. These missions would inspire changes in the town and new missions. As a bird you never can read the notes or understand the players, the text just looks garbled and the people cannot be understood. The player has to be  observative of the characters and the actions that occur to fully understand the story. The two faction thing isn't really important though, I just wanted a more mainstream mission system for player's to enjoy.

Tl;dr Control a bird, eat berries, do missions.",2009-12-31 21:09:04
