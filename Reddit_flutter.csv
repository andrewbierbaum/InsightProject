11,"In the absence of any better options, I proposed that we try to make our way to the laboratorys archives, in hopes that it would have spell scrolls or other items that we could somehow combine to cheese our way to victory. We ignored all of the seals we passed, and did our best to avoid anything that looked like a boss. Upon entering the archives, our DM mentioned that we found a shriveled corpse holding an elaborately decorated box containing a deck of cards.

Nope nope nope. We checked the shelves to see if there was a solution that didnt involve the Deck of Many Things. The DM proceeded to roll to see what the spell scrolls on the shelves were.

Some were pointless. Some would have been useful if Id been high enough level to cast them.

And one was a scroll of Wish.

Now, our DM had a houserule that if you tried to cast a spell from a spell scroll and failed the DC, you suffered magical backlash based on how powerful the spell was. In this case, the DM told me that if I failed the roll, Id basically be instantly vaporized. I did the math. I had to roll at least an eleven. I had exactly fifty-fifty odds.

Panicking slightly from the pressure, I started paging through the Players Handbook, looking for some way to improve my odds. I couldnt find any. Losing patience, our rogue declared that she was pulling a card from the Deck of Many Things.

She proceeded to vanish, the card fluttering gently to the floor.

Well one party member was already down. We were out of options. I read the scroll, and rolled to see if I got better than a ten.

NAT

FUCKING

ELEVEN

Once I finished shouting in relief, I very carefully considered my wish. Id confirmed as best as I could that it was the goddess of knowledge whod been sealed away. However, I was worried that the seals would have protections against being broken via magic. Id tested this earlier with Mage Hand, and found that at the very least, they could be disabled via physical force created via magic.

So I spent a casting of Wish on Mage Hand. Well, more accurately I spent it on dozens of Mage Hands, one for each remaining seal.

The world began spinning wildly. We were thrown about the room, while books, scrolls, and ancient broken technology of divine make bounced around with us.

Then it stopped. We got up. We were in a white void, An elderly gnome, or what looked like an elderly gnome, smiled approvingly at us from her chair.

I wasnt expecting you to actually succeed.

We were a little bit stunned, but we began asking questions, mostly about mysteries we'd encountered in the campaign setting. She answered all of them, and assured us that she'd wiped the memories of the elven demigods, so we wouldn't need to fear their reprisal. She then proceeded to ask me what had driven me to free her. I told her that I simply loved knowledge.

Naturally, she approved of my answer immensely, and decided on a suitable reward.

A stone doorway appeared near us. It cracked open, and black shadowy tentacles began reaching out.

Crap. I'd seen enough spoilers for FMA to know that this was probably bad.

Upon being dragged though, I was exposed to all knowledge in existence. I became omniscient.

I then awoke on a hilltop, not too far from the village we'd been staying in, my mind spinning from having briefly contained infinitely more information than it was equipped to handle. I'd forgotten everything I saw behind the stone door. More than that, even. I checked my spellbook. All but a few pages were now blank.

I'd asked my DM if I could continue playing this character in the next campaign, so I wasn't upset at having been knocked back down to an appropriate level.",2018-06-15 01:29:25

Dawn Hydrangeas do spawn here but there's a better spot that gives more and sumpkin

Dawn Hydrangea, clear sky peak gives a ton of these and some sumpkin too. I'd use this over the Torigoth flower patch.

Melodious melon, you can get on the argentum sky deck, but only one of the nodes spawn them and they are pretty rare. What I do is get 20 and then alternate between getting the flutter glass, then the node, then get love sources.

27,"Nah. It has the illusion of being better at those things by having a super diverse cast but still sidelining the minorities and lgbtq characters. Looking at the one character in the core four who is a minority, Veronica Lodge (people might argue that KJ Apa is half Samoan, and that's fine and I'm glad he's proud of his heritage, but it's pretty safe to say that Archie Andrews is white and is perceived as white and is white in society), and seeing how Veronica is treated compared to the other three not only in writing but also by a large portion of the fandom who sweeps all of Bughead's wrongdoings under the carpet and insists that Ronnie is an evil bitch from Hell at every turn conceivable, I think it has just as much to do with the fanbase as the writing. These shows at least in the states are watched largely by heterosexual white girls who subconsciously gravitate towards ""their"" things. Most shows tend to know their demographic and intend to appease them. It's hard to tell these fans that they have racial and other biases because they truly do not recognize it and are not being deliberately or maliciously prejudiced, and when you use the R word around them (racist) they will just get super defensive about it, sitting there in their Hannah Montana PJs while listening to Taylor Swift and identifying heavily with Betty Cooper, beyond triggered that you would even \*\*imply\*\* that their brain is conditioned to seek out and stan the whitest things in everything. Think about how almost every relationship of significance on this program involves people of color and/or lgbtq characters, and how Betty/Jughead are pretty much the one true blue white heterosexual romantic pairing, and how much more popular they are than everything else on the show. I don't think that's entirely a coincidence, at all. It's because Bughead makes Becky and Karen's ovaries flutter like nothing else, and the writers and showrunners know it.

Sometimes I wonder if my favorite Archie comics character who is a main character in the source material and usually makes the core four a core five would be more important on this program if they had stuck to his original Caucasian appearance instead of making him Asian, and that's a sad question to have to ask.",2018-06-15 04:29:09

I think the mane 6 started between 21 and 25. Twilight was probably 22 ish, pinkie could be 21, Fluttershy is probably 23, Applejack and Rarity I think would have to be 25, and Rainbow Dash is probably 21. 

Spike, I'd place at 12 at the shows start. Maybe 13. (Still a baby, for a dragon, who easily live 1000 years)

The Cutie Mark Crusaders are probably like 13 or 14. Which makes them very young compared to their sisters. But still at the right age to get all the problems associated with school. 

So... by season 5, that would put them about 3 years older, and by season 8, they'd be 4 to 5 years older. So, at that point the Crusaders would have to be high school seniors.

32,"You should pursue this further. What country do you live in? There are A LOT of things the ECG should be able to tell a doctor, and it seems very weird that they only commented on the heart attack issue. A good doctor will show you the readouts from the ECG, explain what's normal, show you specifically ON THE PAPER what isn't normal, why it's not normal, what it's called, etc etc etc. 

If you're going to a doctor that doesn't explain things, get a new one. Period. 

Go to a general practitioner, let them know you've been having painful, irregular heartbeats and you would like a referral to see a specialist--even if just to put your mind at ease. A general practitioner should be able to get you in to see a cardiologist. 

To rule out other possible issues: 

\- How are your electrolytes? Simply drinking water may not be enough. Remember: salt, magnesium and potassium are the most important electrolytes and are key to hydration. You can get these in powdered form online or at a health store and add them to a drink a couple times a day to ensure you are properly balanced out; it DOES make a difference. Fatigue, heart palpitations, lethargy, mental fogginess, and irritability can all be helped by supplementing electrolytes. Most of us are not adequately hydrated. 

\- Are you sure this isn't an anxiety issue? (The pain makes me think no) 

\- How is your diet and lifestyle? How is your weight? 

A simple blood test can flag or eliminate some base-level concerns before you go all-out at the cardiologist for a full workup. It makes sense to step things up incrementally.

37,">if you get hard into the throttle and let off quick it will flutter air back through the intake. There is nowhere else for the air to go.

Point of clarification;  you're not wrong, you're just not labeling this particular aspect of a turbo system.

Wastegates or variable nozzle turbines control boost by altering the turbine wheel speed.  The flutter isn't related to the wastegate directly, but the absence of a compressor bypass function, aka ""blowoff valve"" which is not found on stock diesel systems... possibly because they don't usually have a throttle plate.  Even without a throttle plate on a diesel, though, as you pointed out the flutter can still take place because manifold pressure is high, air volume is up, but suddenly has nowhere to go.  The fluttering is supersonic air bouncing between the engine and the turbo compressor.  This can be bad in extreme cases and can cause severe damage to a turbocharger... up to and including broken wheel or snapped turbo shaft.",2018-06-15 05:38:00
38,"I live in the U.S. When I wore the heart monitor, I only had fluttering problems, none of the stabbing pains. I had a little button I was supposed to push when I was having the flutterings. My doctor said when they reviewed the reports of when I pushed the button, those were normal skips that happen to other people too. (I can't remember what they were called.) I never saw a cardiologist. I just went straight from my GP to a center where they gave me the monitor and explained how to use it. I never saw any printouts or results. I do need a new doctor. Mine is a nincompoop. 

I think it's very possible that I'm not hydrated enough because I don't drink enough water. But I don't drink anything else either. I'm not a soda person. I'm either drinking water or herbal tea, or very occasionally a decaf coffee. I am on a huge daily multi-vitamin but I don't know if that would help with electrolytes.

I think when I'm having these heart problems, then I start to get anxious about it, and that doesn't help. But honestly a lot of these palpitations and especially the stabbing pains come when I'm not thinking about it at all. Sometimes I've woken up because of the stabbing pains. I've been told they can possibly be muscular, but I don't understand how they can happen then when I am literally unconscious and not moving. 

I was a few pounds overweight (for me) after I broke a leg. I went up to 137, which was an all-time high. But I'm a pretty small person generally, and I'm back down to 125 now. I'll be honest that I'm almost totally sedentary - desk job by day, classes by night. But I generally don't eat junk anymore. I'll have the occasional potato chips and chocolate and coffee, sure. But most days I eat real food with real nutrients in it for every meal. If I'm busy, I might have a frozen meal but usually it's something like an Amy's with better ingredients. I've never smoked and I don't drink frequently. I'm eating better than I ever have, so I'm just surprised that I'm suddenly having all these weird problems and my cholesterol jumped sky-high (which the doctor didn't even mention until it had been high for two years). I guess I'm more prone to anxiety about all this too because my dad died of a heart attack at 58 and I don't want to ignore something I shouldn't be ignoring.

But the flutterings and occasional shooting pains, and sometimes being unable to lie on that side without feeling everything having to work so hard are all new.",2018-06-15 06:05:40

44,"> I've been told they can possibly be muscular, but I don't understand how they can happen then when I am literally unconscious and not moving.

Well your heart is a muscle, and it works even when you're sleeping lol. 

Anxiety and trauma can surface in various ways. You could get panic attacks without any obvious trigger. My aunt thought she was having a heart attack once, went to the ER....turns out she was just having a MASSIVE, MASSIVE panic attack because she had been sexually abused her whole life by her dad....which she also suppressed and never even realized even though it went on into her adult life. Seriously. She had no idea. She had NO IDEA why she was having a ""heart attack"" in the middle of the night. 

I'm not saying you're suppressing years of sexual abuse (lol) but that the body can process trauma in strange ways. Only you know your history and mental health, but it is worth considering if just for a moment. 

Is the pain and fluttering associated with exercise at all? 

IF you're deficient in electrolytes simply drinking water may not be enough. I would highly recommend buying them in powdered form and mixing them into a drink a couple times a day. Its a low-cost solution with almost immediate benefits. Win-win. 

> my cholesterol jumped sky-high (which the doctor didn't even mention until it had been high for two years). 

Oh my god I hate your doctor. Go to a new one! lol what an idiot. ",2018-06-15 06:37:48
45,"Common misconception: A greenseer requires a weirwood tree's vantage point for looking into the past. This simply isn't the case. Greenseers can see beyond the trees. The bust for that particular myth is written in plain text in ADWD Bran III:

> ""Once you have mastered your gifts, you may look where you will and see what the trees have seen, be it yesterday or last year or a thousand ages past. Men live their lives trapped in an eternal present, between the mists of memory and the sea of shadow that is all we know of the days to come. Certain moths live their whole lives in a day, yet to them that little span of time must seem as long as years and decades do to us. An oak may live three hundred years, a redwood tree three thousand. A weirwood will live forever if left undisturbed. To them seasons pass in the flutter of a moth's wing, and past, present, and future are one. Nor will your sight be limited to your godswood. The singers carved eyes into their heart trees to awaken them, and **those are the first eyes a new greenseer learns to use  but in time you will see well beyond the trees themselves.**""

The trees make sight easier, but their absence doesn't prevent a seasoned greenseer from viewing an area.",2018-06-15 06:56:15

48,"Normally I would put the ""Flutterpie Touch"" story here, but I think I'm gonna grab a different incident out of the Storytime Bag for this one.

It was 8th grade. Just a normal day, sitting in English class, when a science teacher comes in with a new girl who had just moved here and was exploring the school. The English teacher was looking for students to take this girl on a tour. 

And of course, with the new girl having autism and me having autism, she picked *me.* Of all fucking people.

Granted, if she hadn't, I wouldn't be friends with this girl today, but still. The fact that she singled me out to take a new autistic student around the school *solely* for the fact that I have autism and for no other reason? Makes me pissed off. If I could travel back in time and still hold all the skills of my 20-year-old self, I'd be protesting.",2018-06-15 07:45:55
49,"It's hard as fuck, even harder than anything they have done. I can tell already that people that were into AIIWYL will likely not like this track. Its *very* bass heavy (real sub bass too, not fluttered upper bass), and has just one truly ""pop"" sections. Sounds like a song made by a DJ rather than a pop group. Its the middle of the night so I can't blast this on my speaker system yet but I feel like a sub will definitely improve enjoyment of this song.",2018-06-15 09:13:30

Well, yesterday on the way home from work, my husband and I were chatting with each other during our respective drives, and our son started in telling daddy that he has a baby sister. My husband told him he didn't have one, but asked if he wanted one!! So now my son keeps ASKING for a baby sister... of course my ovaries are all fluttery with both my husband and my son essentially begging me to have another baby

56,"As someone who is nearing completion of their react webapp (I love my server-side rendered react / redux / react-router / firebase stack) and will soon (in the next 2-3 months) begin porting to android / ios, this blog post made me feel like now is not a great time to be digging into react native because it will be fundamentally changing a lot, and that maybe its current architecture is difficult and archaic?

I have been looking closely at using flutter and dart. I'm not an expert on comparing the architectures, but it appears to have already solved the challenges that React Native is just starting to address with their re-architecture?
