2,"Nothing, one just moves on. The night will pass, the sun will rise, the world will keep on spinning, everyone and everything keeps doing what they've been doing and one keeps on living.

When the emotional void turns out to be too much to bear, then perhaps one'll need to cower and hide for a while. One locks doors, cover windows, stops answering calls, texts and mails and disappears from social media.

Eventually reality hits and one starts needing things, food, paying bills, keeping a roof; so one goes through the motions, faking it if needed. One works because one needs the money, then works some more because being alone doing nothing feels scary. Eventually the workload increases because one has become a slave to work, so everyone finds it easier to dump it all on the slave, position one accepts begrudgingly and then realizes ""one's ego is starting to matter"".

Later on the workload either normalizes itself, or one sets the record straight. It's been a while since one started being a corporate slave, and thus the bank account has filled quite a bit. However one's diet and physical condition has deteriorated. Since one now cares about oneself, appearance is starting to look important too, so one exercises and cares about meals again, thus going out becomes a common practice once more.

People start noticing one's outings and rumors fly. Eventually old personal links that one might've left behind start reappearing, and one starts making amends to them if one has been the offending party by disappearing. Old group hobbies start seeming appealing again, which brings back memories of old individual hobbies that now seem appealing again too. One's time starts to fill up again, but now it's more fulfilling, now one is having fun and enjoying life once more, something that doesn't go unnoticed by others who feel attracted to the happiness one shares.

Eventually, between the many joyful meetings there's one that stands above the rest, which one can't just seem to forget. It's happening again and one recognizes the symptoms, the fluttering, the expectations, the hopes and the daydreaming, the connections that one sees and hopes the other does too, and with all that, the fears that all of that goes by unnoticed or worse yet, ignored. One stresses and frets, and early or late one obtains the courage to confess.

And so we've returned to the beginning once again, is one being loved? or is one being left?",2018-05-23 02:54:29
3,"**Long pause** Well, it seems to me we have to understand what we're talking about.  You see, it's no accident that this is something the chicken has to think about and really.  get.  clear.  in his mind.  It's no accident, it's really complicated, man.  And it seems to me that it's, what would you call it, it's **flutters fingers** The Embodiment Of The Abdication Of Ambition In The Achievement Of A Goal, something approximating that.  But the chicken isn't thinking any of that, he's thinking **stabbing with index finger** ""I damn well want to cross that bloody road!""  It's like **waves hands** ""Hey, more power to you!  You know?""  But if the chicken does that, he's got to really understand that crossing the road has to be conducive to the Manifestation Of Truth In One's Own Life, roughly speaking.  Because once he's on the other side of the road, he's not any longer on the side of the road you started on!  And on that side, things are bloody serious!  The competition is ruthless out there, and if he's spending a second longer than he needs to on the other side of the road, his competitors will be doing everything in their power to **stabbing with index finger** take.  him.  out.  You know, in the United States, it's illegal to induct anyone into the armed services if they have an IQ of less than 83.  It's 10% of the population!  It's like, I nearly fainted when I heard that!  And so if you think about it, the chicken's spending his time on the other side of the road, so he's probably low in agreeableness, but he's probably low in conscientiousness.  That's not good!  And so the chicken needs to think about this choice very, very seriously.",2018-05-23 02:57:57
4,"Thank you /u/Komebitz and /u/sho-taBlue for posting this. I agree that she is saying ""believe"" at the outset. It is in parallel to the second line if that makes any sense. Without the conflict (she believes in love but the person she is singing to does not), the song falls apart. I ""believe"" you nailed it.

As to the use of the term Tattoo, it could be taken to mean a loud, rhythmic beat which suggests, I think, the pounding of her heart as she is overwhelmed by her feelings of love for someone. Her heart is fluttering which suggests also that it is skipping a beat, also related to her strong feeling for someone. 

It is a really well-crafted song, great music - another hit for BM! Thank you again for this translation. I can hardly wait for the new album.",2018-05-23 02:59:28

11,"[](/abbored) If you ask me, it happened to all of the mane 6, not just Pinkie. It's just getting really apparent here in season 8, but it was present in season 7 as well. Some would say it started back in season 6 or even 3, but those had quite moderate mistakes in this vein. Hell, Pinkie was always a bit annoying, just look at season 1!

I don't know, the writers just seem less interested in the old characters. The new writers don't really have an idea what to do with the characters at all, while the old writers seem more interested with the new side characters. Which wouldn't be a problem if the new side characters weren't boring as a bar of sand. The students barely have a single character trait, Starlight lost all of her potential and the villains all get the same exact backstory, but progressively worse.

[](/sp)

[](/spikewoke) I'm pretty sure what we're experiencing here is flanderization. And no, not the ""I didn't like her in this episode"" kind of flanderization, but actual flanderization. When a character's small quirks and gimmicks *gradually* take over their entire character. Just look at Fluttershy, her angry side turned from something rare and special to something that comes out in pretty much all of her episodes, sometimes even without consequences. Or Applejack's and Rainbow Dash's competitiveness. Or Pinkie's silliness. 

At this rate, they're going to turn to be like the student 6, who have only a single character trait, which gets played until your nose bleeds.

Sure, we get some excellent character moments like last episode, but we might already be in a seasonal rot.

13,"When his lover exhaled her observation, Damon's eyes were as yet closed, though he was most certainly awake by now. Gone now was the deep and heavy breathing of a man contentedly asleep, returned to the more regular and light breaths of a man who wanted to remain in bed with his paramour indefinitely.

""You still have the Qartheen one. Wear that for now,"" he quipped back in a voice thick with sleep. Only now did his eyes flutter open, blinking away some of the sleep that had accrued there while the pair of lovers slumbered, and a smile worthy of a smitten man thirty years his junior.

""Fret not, my love. You will always be awash in as many gowns as you desire.""

He rolled over, half onto the woman at his side, and kissed her with a softness seldom afforded Zhoe as he'd humiliated her the night prior for his own immense and frequent gratification. A night on which Damon had abandoned any of his inhibitions and near all his worries about the pain that he might cause to his lover, and simply embraced the pure and wild animal side that was deep within every man. On that night he had truly been the Lion of the West, and Zhoe Yronwood - as Lorelei Lannister - had been his prey to play with and consume.

16,"Narrator: Once upon a time, in the magical land of Equestria, there were two regal sisters who ruled together and created harmony for all the land. To do this, the eldest used her unicorn powers to raise the sun at dawn; the younger brought out the moon to begin the night. Thus, the two sisters maintained balance for their kingdom and their subjects, all the different types of ponies. But as time went on, the younger sister became resentful. The ponies relished and played in the day her elder sister brought forth, but shunned and slept through her beautiful night. One fateful day, the younger unicorn refused to lower the moon to make way for the dawn. The elder sister tried to reason with her, but the bitterness in the young one's heart had transformed her into a wicked mare of darkness: Nightmare Moon.: She vowed that she would shroud the land in eternal night. Reluctantly, the elder sister harnessed the most powerful magic known to ponydom: the Elements of Harmony. Using the magic of the Elements of Harmony, she defeated her younger sister, and banished her permanently in the moon. The elder sister took on responsibility for both...Hmm... Elements of Harmony. I know I've heard of those before... but where?: There you are, Twilight! Moon Dancer is having a little get-together in the west castle courtyard. You wanna come?: Oh, sorry, girls... I've got a lot of studying to catch up on.: I know I've heard of the Elements of Harmony.: Oh Spike, you know we don't have time for that sort of thing.: It's over here!My dearest teacher, my continuing studies of pony magic have led me to discover that we are on the precipice of disaster!: That's just it, Spike. The day after tomorrow is the thousandth year of the Summer Sun Celebration! It's imperative that the Princess is told right away!: Oh, I'm not worried, Spike. The Princess trusts me completely. In all the years she's been my mentor she's never once doubted me.My dearest, most faithful student Twilight. You know that I value your diligence and that I trust you completely.My dear Twilight, there is more to a young pony's life than studying, so I'm sending you to supervise the preparations for the Summer Sun Celebration in this year's location: Ponyville. And, I have an even more essential task for you to complete: make some friends!: Maybe the ponies in Ponyville have interesting things to talk about. Come on, Twilight, just try!: Summer Sun Celebration official overseer's checklist. Number one, banquet preparations: Sweet Apple Acres.: [sigh] Let's get this over with... Good afternoon.

Keep up the good work!: Oh, I've never seen a baby dragon before. He's sooo cute!: Oh my, he talks. I didn't know dragons could talk. That's just so incredibly wonderful I, I just don't even know what to say!everything.: I am so sorry, how did we get here so fast? This is where I'm staying while in Ponyville and my poor baby dragon needs his sleep.: Aww, wook at dat, he's so sweepy he can't even keep his widdle bawance!: Sorry, Spike, but I have to convince the Princess that Nightmare Moon is coming, and we're running out of time! I just need to be alone so I can study without a bunch ofcrazyponies trying to make friends all the time. Now, where's the light?: Very surprised. Libraries are supposed to bequiet.: Well, that's silly! What kind of welcome party would this be if it were quiet? I mean, duh, bo-ring! Y'see, I saw you when you first got here, remember? You were all ""hello"" and I was all [deep gasp], remember? Y'see I've never saw you before and if I've never saw you before that means you're new, 'cause I know everypony, and I meaneveryponyin Ponyville!: And if you're new, that meant you haven't met anyone yet, and if you haven't met anyone yet, you must not have any friends, and if you don't have any friends then you must be lonely, and that made me so sad, then I had an idea, and that's why I went [deep gasp]! I must throw a great big ginormous super-duper spectacular welcome party and invite everyone in Ponyville! See? And now you have lots and lots of friends!: It's the eve of the Summer Sun Celebration. Everypony has to stay up, or they'll miss the Princess raise the sun! You really should lighten up, Twilight. It's a party!: Ugh, here I thought I'd have time to learn about the Elements of Harmony but, silly me, all this ridiculous friend-making has kept me from it! ""Legend has it that on the longest day of the thousandth year, the stars will aid in her escape, and she will bring about everlasting night."" I hope the Princess was right... I hope it really is just an old pony tale...: Isn't this exciting? Are you excited, 'cause I'm excited, I've never been so excited-- well, except for the time that I saw you walking into town and I went [deep gasp] but I mean really, who can top that?: Fillies and gentlecolts, as mayor of Ponyville, it is my great pleasure to announce the beginning of the Summer Sun Celebration!: In just a few moments, our town will witness the magic of the sunrise, and celebrate this, the longest day of the year! And now, it is my great honor to introduce to you the ruler of our land, the very pony who gives us the sun and the moon each and every day, the good, the wise, the bringer of harmony to all of Equestria...[ponies chattering quietly and nervously in the background]: Remain calm, everypony, there must be a reasonable explanation!: Ooh, ooh, I love guessing games! Is she hiding?: Oh, my beloved subjects. It's been so long since I've seen your precious little sun-loving faces.: Does my crown no longer count now that I have been imprisoned for a thousand years?

19,"A crimson portal, fluttering of black wings, the sight of a familiar island, and an even more familiar headstone emblazoned with a burning rose. Years have passed since Raven Branwen had set foot on the island of Patch, much less this particular site, Summer Rose's final resting place. After her battle with Cinder and the encounter with her daughter that finally shattered the iron mask she desperately sought to preserve, Raven sought a few moments of solace in one of the few places she could reveal her vulnerability.   


She stood in silence for a seemingly incalculable amount of time before she finally spoke.  


""If you were here, I'm sure you would have come up with some ridiculous speech about how there's still hope for someone like me. How I can still make up for what I've done, give some consoling words, and then you'd forgive me with no strings attached. That's what I never understood about you, Rose: regardless of what someone's done to you, you would somehow find a way to forgive them. You always sought to do what's right, and look where it got you."" That closing remark stung Raven, as she knew those weren't her true feelings.  


""You always had an answer, and for that I come to you now, for one last time. I have failed. Yang and Taiyang hate me, Qrow has practically disowned me as his sister, and Yang's friends now see me as an enemy. And I'm not sure I will ever be able to redeem those mistakes and rebuild the burned bridges.""  


Raven kneeled in front of the headstone, and thought about her life up to this point. She and Qrow were born to a harsh reality where the weak did not have the privilege of continuing their lives, where one had to steal and kill to survive against the darkness, and the things hiding in it.   


Memories then led her to her attendance of Beacon Academy along with her brother with the express purpose of using those skills against the people who taught them and people like them. Then they met Summer Rose and Taiyang Xiao Long. These two opened them to concepts that were originally alien. They showed the twins the ways of friendship and camaraderie, finding this company entirely different from their experiences in the tribe.   


While Qrow was more receptive, Raven kept to herself, waiting for the moment Summer and Tai would betray them, but that time never came, and even she opened up, with Summer Rose breaking down the walls with her battering ram of friendship and cookies. Her time in Beacon, and the many battles she took part alongside her newfound comrades and brother, caused her to develop a sense of duty to defend the innocent against the ever encroaching darkness. For a short while, anyway.  


Her mind then wandered to the once bumbling fool, Taiyang Xiao Long, the man she once called annoyance, comrade, lover, then husband. After she left him, Raven would look back at how she had fallen for him. After weeks of seeing him as a great annoyance that she must be rid of, Summer nudged her in a different direction. She made Raven see a different Tai, who wasn't so much as annoying and brash, but gleeful and valiant, followed by Summer's teasing about how she'll get married to him and have many beautiful children and live in a farm together in some idyllic place in Vale.   


The proverbial stone began rolling down the hill as Raven and Taiyang consolidated their love with a kiss after the dance under the gentle glow of the broken moon above, with Summer cooing at the tender scene in front of her. Their marriage was a small event, attended only by some family and close friends, but it was one of the happiest in her life, the chance to live a life she originally thought impossible with the man she'd grow to love. Summer's teasing ended up becoming somewhat accurate, in the end. She and Tai lived had their house in Patch, a quiet, picturesque island to the west of Vale, and a beautiful baby girl. At the moment, Raven thought this bliss would never end, and that the past was just that.  


However, her loyalty to the tribe, the ones who gave her and Qrow the strength to carve their way through the world, was apparently greater than the bond she made with her comrades and her new family.   


After Raven left her family and comrades behind, she took lead of the clan, continuing its existence in the way they were all to familiar with. While her expression masks it, she remembers the innocents she pillaged from, the people she led to an untimely death, and the young Maiden who was afraid of the world whose story was ended by her crimson blade.  


When Raven had heard of Summer's demise, she became unresponsive for weeks. That annoying, kind, genuine light in her life, snuffed out by the convoluted schemes of an old man cursed by the gods. Though she shouldn't be too surprised. After all, she and Qrow were also made pawns in his quest to destroy Salem, the mistress of the Grimm. Though, of all the souls who could have undertaken the task, why did it have to be her? No, that answer was practically rhetorical. No one else had the mettle but her. She was the ideal hero, selfless, brave, skilled, and a great power hidden in her. The perfect warrior to send out to destroy the darkness  


She then ruminated on her future, more specifically her death. While she was not afraid of leaving the world and either going off to whichever inferno waited or darkness that marked the end, she gradually began to loathe the legacy she may leave behind. She could see her headstone now: *'Here lies Raven Branwen: bandit, deadbeat, coward'*. Would the people she hurt come to see her as she has with Summer? Or would her headstone be left to be reclaimed by nature as it erases any traces of her existence?  


Coming back to the present, Raven's breathing became strained as she unsuccessfully tried to suppress her sorrow.    


""You have no reason to help me, Sum, much less forgive me. I threw it all away, and for what? The tribe? To become stronger? Survival? It doesn't matter anymore, I ruined any chances I had to live a decent life and turned away from those who actually gave a damn about me. So tell me, Summer, what could possibly be done now?! What would you have to say in a moment like this!?"" Tears streamed down her face onto the headstone, losing any semblance of composure as she audibly sobbed.   


""Hmm, that's an easy question to answer, don't you think?"" Of all the times *he* could have shown his face, it just had to be now, at what had to be her most vulnerable. ",2018-05-23 06:31:09

22,"Yes, when the car suddenly dies with a scan tool connected, the tool loses connection and restarts also.  This is what made me think its the ECU.

actually though, from what I can see, no other gauges have any problem when the car shuts off.  The lights dont flicker, the radio stays on, the gauges all work...

the only weird thing i Can report is that as the car begins to die the acceletator stops responding.  As a result the RPM starts to dive, and my natural reaction is to get mad and start pumping the accelerator pedal.  The weird part is that this sometimes works in delaying the shutdown, as the rpm dives if I pump sometimes ill get a fluttering moment of acceleration again, but only fleeting as it inevitably turns off despite the momentary delay/reprieve of acceleration lifting the rpm.

24,"I didn't explain the books thing very well.

MLPFIM had a huge and kind fanbase when it was good, and many fans wrote these things called Fanfictions for fun. For example, imagine writing your own story where Ben 10, Harry Potter, and Johnny Test team up to defeat an alien invasion. Or where you get teleported to Equestria, become a pony, and you and your favourite character fall in love. There are good fanfics, there are terrible ones, but the most popular MLP fanfic of all time...

Is this garbage story called ""Past Sins"". It's just one of those Naruto fanfics where Little Orphan Naruto gets adopted by Jiraiya or Kakashi, and generic cute family stuff happens until the eeeevil village ruler decides he needs to take Little Orphan Naruto away because of the dark power he holds. But with ponies, so Twilight Sparkle takes Kakashi's role. But it's still the same basic plot.

The second most popular fanfic in the MLP fandom was this incredibly long fanfic called Fallout Equestria, a combination of Fallout 3 and MLPFIM. With some parts from Fallouts 1 and 2 sprinkled in there for flavour, even though it's mostly 3, the second worst one in the Fallout series, not that its author noticed. It was this huge story about the writer's original character, Littlepip, trying to survive in the post-apocalyptic world of ponified Fallout. And every so often, it'd give you some hints or flashbacks to tell you how the world got this bad, and how nuclear war destroyed Pony World and made it so awful. At the time, I thought it was a great stylistic choice, but I'd have probably dropped the story if I knew from the start how dumb the whole thing was. By the time I got to the part where you learn everything, I had to finish the whole thing just to see if it got any worse. Which I kind of regret because the fanfic's ending was definitely not the fun kind of terrible.

The writer doesn't get why Fallout or MLPFIM worked alone, so they can't work together. The writer had Ponies go to war with Zebras just like in Fallout, without actually understanding why the nuclear war between Fallout's perpetually-old-timey America and Communist China happened. After the war started, three Zebras fleeing the country and crossing the border got shot, so the Zebra Army attacked a whole school full of baby unicorns in retaliation, causing Pony Princess Celestia to give up on being a Pony Princess. Her sister Pony Princess Luna took over, and Zebras freaked out because they thought the stars are evil so Luna must be evil. Zebras are stupid. Anyway, Fluttershy invented nukes because she thought it'd stop the fighting, but it didn't because the Zebras thought they had nothing to lose, so nukes flew. The survivors went into Vaults, which were renamed to Stables in this story.

It's, uh... It's not a good story. It's as dumb as it sounds, and it distracts you from how dumb the premise is by distracting you with violence and suffering. The story does a good job of pretending it isn't a mindless violence-fest by having the characters feel sad about the violence, but there's a reason why the whole thing feels like a Dungeons and Dragons campaign made by the world's most incompetent DM. Rassafrassin' Enclave...

Oh, and don't get me started on that spinoff made by a fan, Fallout Equestria: Project Horizons. It's got everything ""Cool"" (Super dumb and only there to look cool) about the original story multiplied by four. I have this short and funny but inappropriate way of describing it, from a ""Describe a fanfic's plot badly"" thread I once posted in.",2018-05-23 10:19:49

- The feelings are not constant, and go back and forth like a pendulum

My problem is not getting armor stones, it's that I can't get Cosmicite Ore, Allfire Stone, Flutterfly, or Meldspar Ore to combine with the armor stones to make true armor spheres or strong armor spheres yet. I was hoping those would be available in G1 but the maps all of those are available in don't show up until G2. But that's OK. So far G1 is not as hard as I expected it to be. It's true what everyone says though. In G1 I see you do have to learn to rely less on armor for protection and simply learn to get hit less often. I think even if I had the ores I wanted to upgrade my armor it still wouldn't be enough to protect me from a lot of G rank hits from monsters. I just need to learn to avoid them better now.

45,"The writing is very, very clever for a kids-oriented show.  The leads really capture well what it can be like to be an awkward adolescent, dealing with changes and creeping up slowly on adulthood, trying to manage romantic feelings and cravings for the first time.  It's as if the writers were teenagers themselves once.  Pop culture references are snuck in without being screamed through megaphones, characters have flaws that they learn from but never completely overcome, relationships evolve a bit over time.  There is a healthy dose of humor throughout, but romantic angst as well.

The core of the show is the relationship between the two leads:  Marinette loves Adrien, who is secretly Chat Noir, who loves Ladybug in both his identities, who is secretly Marinette.  The Love Square, as fans call it, leads to all kinds of plot tangles and Marinette's fluttering over Adrien can be really entertaining without going absurdly over-the-top; it rings true at its core.  

The main villain is extremely one-dimensional in most of Season 1 but gets more development in Season 2, particularly due to his role in the life of one of the two leads.  Season 2 in general is a big improvement, as many of the Season 1 episodes were reportedly written and produced in a rush.  If you're interested, I'll point you at a handful of episodes worth looking at first:

1) Origins, Parts 1 and 2 -- This two-parter lays out the foundation of who these kids are, how they got these powers, what the main villain does and how the leads see each other in and out of costume.  It really should've been the beginning of the series but aired a lot later on for some reason.  

2) Zombizou -- Dawn of the Dead, but on Disney, with kissing instead of biting as the transmission vector.  Maybe my favorite episode overall, absolutely loaded with Romero homages without a single drop of blood.  

3) Gigantitan -- A sillier episode, in which Marinette enlists her friends to help her finally get Adrien out on a romantic stroll with her.  A lot of comedy, a villain-of-the-week that is simultaneously dangerous and ridiculous,

And then there are those that caused this setting to become a shit hole. 

Rage. Rage, rage, rage against the dying of the light.
-Dante before leading the remnants of the sons of Sanguinius to kill the swarm lord before they are all wiped out. 

Yeah life is shit for a lot of people in the Imperium. Billions work and toil and live in unremarkable service to the Imperium. The galaxy has been torn in half by the Despoiler and the laughter of thirsting gods echoes across the void. Another Age of Strife should have come again with the coming of the Cicatrix Maledictum. Humanity shouldve been dead long before the 13th Black Crusade given all the horrors arrayed against them. But they didnt. Because on some distant world, on some forgotten battlefield, a group of guardsmen held the line long enough for survivors to escape or to delay an enemy and allowed their comrades to regroup and retake their world. Or a grey knight, alone in the darkness and lone survivor of his squad, managed to banish a daemon before his life fluttered from existence so it could not claim a world. Or deep in the underhive of some bloated hive world, an inquisitor and their retinue have stopped a genestealer cult and prevented another world from being overtaken by the great devourer. Even when Goge Vandire ruled the Imperium, he was toppled by one man who believed in the beliefs of the Emperor and led a crusade to denounce the heretic. Even now with the Imperium being torn in half, there is still hope. A light in the encroaching darkness with the coming of the Avenging Son and reinforcements. 

Thats what interests me. That life is hard and horrible. But its not all for nothing because in the end, small, insignificant people can make a difference. Theres a chance, small though it is, for their life to have meaning. And hope is born from small chances.

55,"The first design rule of a mechanical or electrical engineer should be: if it is made of an elastic material, it stores energy...

...and the second rule is: if it stores energy, it releases such energy, sooner or later.

The not controlled energy, stored and released, causes blurriness or ugliness of sound, in an average turntable.

The audiophiles use to chat about mass when they describe a turntable, but the concept of (huge) mass in a turntable is completely meaningless, unless you consider also how this mass is distributed.

The audiophiles also use to talk about damping; damping is a magic word, for the average audiophile, but damping actually means spreading the stored energy of the physical body all around the audio spectrum, with horrible results.

So, why Atmo Sfera is different: we are well aware of the elastic behaviour of every man-made turntable, so we choose to put all resonances (the effects of the energy release) in a part of the audio band in which they cannot be very harmful.

First thing first: we chose to made the entire Atmo Sfera body in Anticorodal aluminium; aluminium is stiff and  has a pretty isotropic structure; the behaviour of the aluminium is fully predictable. The  secret of  seasoned engineers is to work, as much as possible, in a linear and predictable environment.

Second, but very important, issue: the shape of the turntable base and of the LP disc support are designed to show a series of natural vibration modes very far from the audio band or from the vinyl resonances.

Take, for example, the small reverse cup that holds the vinyl record: the cup and the record press device form a hemisphere, that is a solid with controlled and predictable vibration modes.


This is the first vibration mode simulation, with the displacement ratio of the body shown in colours

Please note, the first mode of vibration occurs (in our model) at more than 9,1 kHz; the resonance of an average vinyl occurs at about 4 kHz (estimated in an empirical mode), more than an octave lower, so few chances are than a vibration of the cup can  trigger any dangerous vibration in vinyl.

Take now as an example the Atmo Sfera base:


The (greatly exaggerated) displacement (in the real word are fractions of a micron) show the first vibration mode at more than 18 kHz, at the upper limit of the audio band, in which the RIAA equalization has an attenuation of about 18 dB with respect to the centre frequency.

We can fix the turntable motor directly to the base, without the use of damping material and get no vibrations induced into the record.

Next step for a turntable design: how to guarantee a rotation free of wow & flutter, the annoying meeow that plagues some   reputed turntables with a low platter mass.

The secret is simple and is the following: To create a turntable in which the pair of Complex conjugate poles of the mechanical rotating system are as close as possible to the Real axis This statement is meaningless for all the people, we bet, except for the few electrical or mechanical engineers that are reading this document, so we will do an example.

Imagine to have two different driving belts for your turntable : the first made of rectified silicone rubber, similar to those used in many British turntables, the second belt made by a rubberband used for closing small packets.
Should an audiophile choose one of them for his turntable, he will undoubtedly choose the rectified silicone rubber belt without any doubt. I chose, instead, the rubberband, because it helped the designer to get the Complex conjugate poles closer to the Real axis. 
It's not a joke, we really tested the rectified silicone etc. against a rubberband and the rubberband performed better in our design, from a point of view of W&F ratio, according to the theory and to the step response analysis.
Using this kind of approach to the problem, no matter how low the turntable weight is (within reasonable limits); you will get excellent results with light rotating elements and no heavy mass. An heavy turntable mass doesn't guarantee at all high performances.

Put together the following issues:

 controlled modes of vibrations, well outside the audio frequencies more sensitive to the ear
 limited stored energy due to the low turntable mass
and you will have Atmo Sfera with its neutral and  fulfilling sonic behaviour.",2018-05-23 16:57:33

57,"tl;dr: Digital audio reproduction is perfect, 100% fidelity to the source file. Vinyl has many weak spots between the source ""file"" (the vinyl record) and the preamp.

1. Platter speed variations can add wow/flutter, ie pitch variations.
2. Turntable construction can add rumble and hums to the signal, from the motor or mechanism
3. The needle and cartridge do not perfectly read the groves; better carts have finer tolerances and will read the record more accurately.

If you want more detail, upgrade the stylus/cartridge. What you may notice then is wow/flutter, rumble, or hum, that was previously inaudible. The next step would be upgrading the turntable to reduce wow, flutter, rumble, and hum (incidentally my favorite 60's pop rock band).",2018-05-23 17:15:41

There is a myriad of ways as ""invisible wars"" are waged ... include into sonic weaponry also plasma weaponry research ( project M.A.R.A.U.D.E.R. ) and laser weaponry research ( project SHIVA STAR ) and you get a huge array of weapons used for clandestine operations . 


""Studies have found that exposure to high intensity ultrasound at frequencies from 700 kHz to 3.6 MHz can cause lung and intestinal damage in mice. Heart rate patterns following vibroacoustic stimulation has resulted in serious negative consequences such as atrial flutter and bradycardia.

The extra-aural (unrelated to hearing) bioeffects on various internal organs and the central nervous system included auditory shifts, vibrotactile sensitivity change, muscle contraction, cardiovascular function change, central nervous system effects, vestibular (inner ear) effects, and chest wall/lung tissue effects. Researchers found that low frequency sonar exposure could result in significant cavitations, hypothermia, and tissue shearing. No follow up experiments were recommended. Tests performed on mice show the threshold for both lung and liver damage occurs at about 184 dB. Damage increases rapidly as intensity is increased. The American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine (AIUM) has stated that there have been no proven biological effects associated with an unfocused sound beam with intensities below 100 mW/cm SPTA or focused sound beams below an intensity level of 1 mW/cm SPTA.

Noise-induced neurologic disturbances in scuba divers exposed to continuous low frequency tones for durations longer than 15 minutes has involved in some cases the development of immediate and long-term problems affecting brain tissue. The symptoms resembled those of individuals who had suffered minor head injuries. One theory for a causal mechanism is that the prolonged sound exposure resulted in enough mechanical strain to brain tissue to induce an encephalopathy. Divers and aquatic mammals may also suffer lung and sinus injuries from high intensity, low frequency sound. This is due to the ease with which low frequency sound passes from water into a body, but not into any pockets of gas in the body, which reflect the sound due to mismatched acoustic impedance.",2018-05-23 19:40:47

Why is this my problem     
Last time we spoke, you had a similar problem, how did *you* deal with it then?    
I cant help you with this    

Expect her to *instantly* ratchet up the guilt/whining/whinging in an attempt to keep you reeled in tightly to her. 

This has the smell of your mom using you for Nsupply (emotional vampirism). She whines, you making calming noises/solve her problem for her; she gets her hit of Nsupply. She comes around everytime she starts jonesing. If you start distancing yourself, expect her to go into withdrawal and ratchet up the crazy.

In addition you are going to have to practice strict phone discipline. After ten minutes on the phone with her (especially the calls where she is all in a flutter) find an excuse to get off the call: you have an appointment, dinner is ready, so-and-so just showed up, doorbell is ringing. Limit your exposure to her and she will have less opportunity to use you as her emotional dumping ground.

I was in the humvee for what felt like hours, when we stopped I was jostled out and moved down a hallway into an elevator. There floors down, left, left, right into a chair. They strapped me down and cuffed my wrists and ankles. The bag was removed and light flooded me. ""Activate the nanos."" Pain flooded my entire body as my muscles rearranged themselves. Images flooded my mind, my eyes burned in the bright lights.  I could hear 5 different heartbeats. Mine was racing as the others slowly climbed reaching a crescendo that pounded in my ears. I could smell the sweat off myself and the individual scent of everyone in the room. Cherry blossom, Sex Cougar, and two different types of Axe. It was nauseating and my stomach roiled as my body was overloaded by my senses. Slowly it faded as my body acclimated. The light dimmed and everyone in the room became visible. ""Vitals sat, nanos sat, diagnostics sat, testing in progress, subject should notice a HUD momentarily as the final nanos neuralize and activate to spec"" Peach blossom said quietly.  She was right, a HUD did appear through my eyes.  Peach Blossom had a tag above her head that read ""Mommy"". The other tags read ""Spectre, Wraith, and Ghoul"". Peach blossom's heart fluttered. ""Final tests sat, project ""Demon"" is a success. Initiating memory override."" My mind went blank. Drool fell from my mouth and I remembered being young, and being told I had a fatal neural disease. I remember Peach blossom crying as I clung to her skirt.  A man in a crisp blue uniform with birds on his collars took her to the side and spoke to her. She cried harder as she nodded her head.  Mommy told me I was going to have surgery and it would make me better. That one day I would be a soldier like Daddy. That I wasn't going to die. The memory fell into place. The cuffs were removed. A man with stars on his collars told me to come with him, I had to be briefed on the details of my first mission. I stood, and walked over to Mommy. I kissed her cheek as she cried. Then I followed Admiral Chancellor, as his tag on my HUD identified him, to a room with many screens and sat down to brief. ",2018-05-23 19:58:31

I pay so much attention to that now it's borderline obssessive.

They're so much more expressive than men's.

Other women just have this innate ability to convey emotion by expressing it in their face.

Last night, for instance, I was watching this game show here in Aus. 

There were two beautiful ladies on it and I just found myself glued to the screen reading their expressions and not only did my heart flutter, it was just so (what's the word) heartwarming to see.

A good friend of mine studies psych at uni (she's straight, ugh, she's so gorgeous, though) and she works at my local comic book store and studies and seeing her in that zone is so exciting and yet can stop me.

This was in the dial-up days, and was in a chat room when reports were coming in that Princess Di had been involved in a car crash. I stuck my TV on, and sure enough the BBC were reporting it. We chatted back and forth for maybe an hour online and updating one another, when the Americans said their news were now quoting sources that shed died. The BBC didnt even mention anything for at least another ten to fifteen minutes, when theyd announced that Buckingham Palace confirmed it. In retrospect there must have been a race on to be the first to get the big news out there, but thats how misinformation happens. The BBC took their time ignoring all the rumours, and didnt report a damn thing til they knew for sure. 

But as soon as they announced it, they cut to the Union Flag fluttering in the wind and played the national anthem, and I was dumbfounded as Id never seen anything that serious before, or since.

If you want to be clever, you can also point out that Athena sprung from Zeus's head. Also the author forgets the muses, also daughters of Zeus and guardians of culture.

Hindu Mythology presents some fertile ground for the exploration of masculine, feminine, order and chaos (not to mention the androgynous aspects of all their main Gods and God), but that would require actually understanding the psychological and archetypal nature of these myths instead of using them for political argument.

95,"I have played rust since 2013 and I think the game is better today than ever before.  I continue to have unique experiences and I continue to have fun, even after thousands of hours.  Prototheos made some fair points about how his experience in the game has changed over time for the negative, and I can't criticize with what ultimately amount to his preferences.  What I do disagree with is influencers in the community effectively campaigning for rust to die; using their platform to influence young and novice audiences into their way of thinking while raking in ad, sub, donation and merch revenue.  
The common denominator amongst all Rust influencers is that they are experienced players.  I'm here to argue that these individuals are confusing their own personal exhaustion with the game for it being broken or dying.  It's reasonable to get tired of any game after thousands of hours, regardless of how amazing it once was.  I view these people as desperate to drag others down with them, and too selfish to go out and die in the woods like a gentleman.  
I grow disgusted with the Rust community not because of it's toxicity, not because of it's Chad, not because of it's KOS - i grow disgusted with how spoiled everyone is becoming, and how they fail to appreciate that we have one of the best developers ever making one of the best games ever.  
I propose that people claiming Rust is dying should in fact quit the game and never come back.  We need to cleanse the Rust playerbase of all whiners and get back down to business.  
Fellow newman, if you are looking for other people to form your opinion, then you forever flutter in the wind.  Stop supporting Rust influencers who talk negatively about the game for profit.  Start playing modded servers that cater to your preferred game type, or quit and move on.

1. NO CONTACT  - This is really important  

2. Time (as cliched as it sounds, its true) - It took me 6 months to feel human. 1 full year to feel happy. YMMV   

3. Distraction (hobbies, podcasts, gym) - Cardio does wonders for my mood. When I'm feeling down, I'd run until I couldn't run anymore. Crazy runners high and a sense of accomplishment. I also love true crime, so I started listening to the ""My Favorite Murder"" podcast. Replaced all the chatter in my head with something TOTALLY different. If true crime isn't your thing, there's so many podcasts out there. They just helped me get out of my head.  

4. A new man - He doesn't have to be the love of your life. But it is AMAZING to get that butterfly feeling again, even just for a moment.

118,"It's not uncommon for empty nesters to take up a new hobby to occupy their time. Things like book club, golfing, pottery, painting. This is a story about how that happened with my parents during my first semester at college.

Now for some context, my parents, Michaela and Mitchell Thompson, have always been on the progressive, left of center side of things. You know the type. White, middle class, suburban liberals.  Mom's a vegetarian, who fed me my fair share of tofu dogs and veggie burgers. Dad plays bass and surfs when he's not being a CPA and world class nerd. I got shuttled to and from soccer matches and band practices in the back of a minivan like most children of my generation. Ours had the tell tale bumper stickers with such statements as  ""Coexist"" , ""Support Our troops, Bring them Home!"", ""Yes We Can!"" and \(later\) ""Feel The Bern"". My self esteem was well looked after, and my feelings always considered. I was encouraged and given reassurance. Conversations pertaining to ""heavy"" subjects like politics, sex and death, were handled in a rational, adult way that made me feel included and respected.  I was, in essence, the only child of two pretty cool parents. 

Being the only son from a reasonably well off family, between savings and Sallie Mae, they were able to afford to send me to an out of state school. My grades weren't Ivy League level, but good enough to get me into a damn good private college on the other side of the country. There was the typical scene at the airport, a tearful goodbye hug from mom, a manly handshake, followed by a bear hug from dad. Lectures about calling often, making friends, studying hard and being sensible with money. Since we were stretching it with the cost of food, housing and tuition, it was pretty well decided that I wouldn't be seeing them again for months, airline tickets being what they were. I still have a very clear image in my head of the two of them standing in the terminal. Mom in her white peasant blouse and Jeans, Dad in a pink polo and cargo shorts.  Mom, leaning her head into Dad's shoulder as he squeezed her hand. Her curly red hair framing her pale cheeks as she held up her free hand to wave. Dad looking down to hide his own tears but still smiling at her, taking off his glasses and running the back of his wrist over his eyes. 

I called. Honestly I did. I called, I texted, I emailed. I did as much as can be expected of a young man 3,000 miles from home in the midst of one of biggest changes of his life can be expected to in 3 months. Evidently it wasn't enough to keep up though. Going back over my conversations in my head after I left them that day I cannot believe there weren't any clues to what I was coming home to in all that time. And it's not as though I told them everything about myself either. I'd grown out my hair to past my shoulders and had started to a grow an admittedly pretty pathetic beard.  I'd gotten shit faced, falling down drunk for the very first time in my life. I'd gotten my ears pierced. It hadn't occurred to me to mention any of these things to my parents. Holidays came and went. My birthday passed. I was wrapped up in the midst of my freshman year to notice how much I missed home until it was finally time to head back at the end of the semester.

I took a cab from the airport. They'd offered to pick me up of course, but rolling up to the house in a taxi felt so adult, I insisted on it. I wanted to show them I was a man of the world, a traveler, a grown up. Never mind that the taxi, like the plane ticket and the luggage I was carrying was paid for by my them. The house looked as I remembered it. A modern two story structure on a slope, with a detached garage and flanked by woods on three sides. Seeing it, I finally felt the full 3 months I'd been away and I was overcome with a gladness to be there. To be coming back to the familiar after so long. I half ran up the walkway. Reaching the door there was a split second of confusion of whether to knock or to just enter, before instinct overcame and I opened it and popped in.

""Helloooo!"" I called as I walked in. It took a beat before my brain caught up with my eyes and in that time everything look exactly as it had when I left. Then I blink and I re\-entered the real world. I was immediately hit by the powerful sent of incense. Beneath the incense was another smell, both sweet and pungent that I, as a college student, immediately recognized. A sort of chirpy flute music floated in the air gently. Looking towards the living room, the flat screen TV was gone, and in it's place stood a long Japanese rock garden, with a white porcelain statue of Buddha behind it.  I had time to feel a sense of confusion and mutter ""Huh?"" When I heard a voice coming form the top of the stairs.

""Ooooh! Hiya Billy! C'mere! I've missed you!"" Looking up I was met by the sight of my mother. Her arms were open, her long, coppery curls fell over her shoulders. She had on a long, beaded turquoise necklace that jangled on her chest as she descended the stairs, a silver anklet of bells, and not a stitch more. With her arms up I could see a patch of fiery hair in her pit, and a matching triangle of fuzz between her legs. My mind went blank. I was aware that my mouth was very dry and hanging open and my eyes must have been quite wide. My stomach rolled and fluttered in embarrassment, but I was also struck by a surprising ache, lower down. I blinked and quickly looked away. ""Mom?!  What the\-?!"" But the question dies in my mouth as I head the sound of the sliding patio door opening and closing from the kitchen. 

My Father came around the corner, a huge smile his face. His formally neatly combed brown hair was now a shaggy mop top, and his face was a scruffy, Brillo\-pad of stubble. The only clothes he has on were his wire rimmed spectacles. ""There's my big guy!"" He said jovially, walking towards me at a distressing rate. My eyes fixated on the flaccid, dangling member, flopping back and forth between his legs, in of nest of coarse, dark pubes. My stomach rolled again, harder than before and I felt my eyes strain to look into the back of my skull. I moved to turn around but before I could My mom's hands were on my shoulder, pulling me into a hug. ""Mmm! It's so good to see you!"" She said as she pressed her bare body into mine. I leaned back, throwing my hands to the side as she ran her hand up and down my back and kissed my head ""MMWAH! How was your flight honey?"" She asked taking a step back. Dad came towards me now but I moved too fast this time. I took two rapid steps back and throwing my hands out in front of me, palms out. 

""Dad?!"" I yelled in shock. ""What the hell?!"" My parents shared a puzzled, almost hurt expression as I turned around and closed my eyes.

""What do you mean son?"" Dad asked behind me.

I let out a very long, whining breath. ""You are...with the br\-...and the pe...WHERE ARE YOUR CLOTHES?!"" I finally exploded. For moment I stood silently with my back to them, eyes closed, the only sound the chirp of the flute music.  Then the silence was replaced by sound of them bursting out in gales of laughter. This was not what I expected. It was enough of a surprise that I slowly turned back towards them, keeping my hands squarely over my eyes of course. ""What? what's funny? What's going on?"" I asked.

""Honey, please, we thought there was something really wrong."" My mother said when she had finished laughing.

""What do you mean?"" I demanded, ""You're naked!""

""That's right son, we are."" My father said happily. ""That's nothing 'wrong.' I'm sorry we surprised you, I guess we've gotten so used to it, it didn't even worth mentioning.""

""Wh\-what do you mean? what didn't seem worth mentioning?""

""Your mother and I have become naturists Bill."" He said calmly. 

I shrugged, shaking my head, ""Natuwhat?"" I asked, the word meaning nothing to me. I still was covering my eyes, just guessing that I was facing them. 

""Most people call it nudist dear."" Mom said sweetly. ""But that makes it seem so...silly. We prefer Naturist, since it's not about being naked, it's about being freer and closer to nature.""

""Well it sure looks like it's about being naked!"" I exclaimed, making them both laugh again. ""When did it start? How did it happen? Do you guys go out in public like this? What am I supposed to do about it?"" I asked rapidly.

""Now calm down Big Bill."" Dad said evenly, and I felt a hand on my shoulder. ""We'll answer all those questions in due time. But first and foremost let's get you settled in."" 

""And sweety, I know it's a surprise, but try to open your eyes."" Mom said. ""You'll have to eventually. You can't keep your eyes closed the entire time your here.""

""Watch me try!""

""Oh honey, please? C'mon, it's still just Mom and Dad...""

I sighed as I realized she was right, more on a practical level then anything else. It really wasn't as though I could avoid it the entire time I was here. I let my hand fall back to the bag beside me then slowly opened my eyes. They were standing right in front of me smiling patently and expectantly. I felt my cheeks getting hot, trying to to look beyond their faces, finding my eyes wanting to be drawn down. I swallowed hard, and forced a shy smile ""Sorry I...freaked out....It was just a..shock.""

They both nodded. ""We should have told you, like I said, it's just been such a normal thing for us..."" Dad said and shrugged. 

I nodded back and looked towards the living room. ""What happened to the TV?""

They both frowned in dismay and shook their heads. ""Oh we got rid of it honey.""

""Just a waste of space. keeping us mollified and stupified, filling up the space around it with violence and hate...ick! That zen garden has been there a little over a month it's worth more than a lifetime of TV."" 

""We haven't gotten rid of yours sweety don't worry"" Mom added quickly, seeing the upset look on my face. ""We haven't touched anything in your room. Why don't you take your bag up there, get changed and refreshed,  and then we can talk about things over some dinner...how's a veggie burger sound?""

""Get changed...you mean like...?""

""Only if you're comfortable with it son"" Dad said not unkindly. ""No one expects you to do anything that makes you uncomfortable.""

I started to walk past them when mom took my hand and I looked at her again, getting a really good look for the first time. Her hair stood out brilliantly against her pale white skin, her nipples were perfectly pink nubs on her amble breasts. I was shocked to feel the ache return in my groin, stronger this time. as she pulled me in to her hug once more. ""Mmm I've missed you honey, It really is  great to see you Billy! I love you!"" As she did my nose filled with the familiar scent of her organic, herbal shampoo, while at the same time feeling the press of her breasts on my chest. My stomach fluttered and I grunted a little as my brain overloaded with simultaneous arousal and  nostalgia. 

I gave her a tentative pat on the back. ""I love you too mom."" I said.

For me the warranty has paid off after about 2 years. So far they have replaced front and rear wheel bearings, tie rods, motor mounts and one of the turbos. They replaced one of the turbos because I have a fluttering noise at highway speeds that's hard to duplicate with a tech driving. I still have to take it back to Ford to figure out what's going on.

121,"OMG SIAN THAT CHART LOOKS SO BEAUTIFUL I LOVE IT <3

Thought I wasnt going to be here for this round? WELL YOU THOUGHT WRONG. WRLDDMNTR WATCHED THIS DRAMA SOLO (UNTIL THE END WHEN SHE FINALLY CAUGHT UP)

Be prepared for a giant wave of opinions never shared before, EXCLUSIVE.

First off, the opening song is fucking bomb. Every time I hear it it makes me wanna jam. BF is tired of it already but I can keep going >:D ~~it may have been on repeat for several days now~~

**Teacher Characters**

**Ha Na**: Not too many positive feelings towards her character Overall I thought she was kinda weak and she sorta stayed that way. But I think the actress is kinda cute and somehow I have some kinda face blindness towards her She looks *completely* different based on her hair. I really like the actress and her pulling off all the fucking stunts they had her do. Scenario one: The dancing at the club. Seemed a little OOC but she worked it so well!!! And then the nearly impractical kiss scene mad props. After having tried it ~~for science~~, HOW??! Scene three: The solo karaoke session was admittedly great, and all the times she had the sing. I LOVED all the kpop in this drama. Scene four: Her being sad in the apartment and dancing with tissue paper. I know Im easily amused but what can you do.

**Trash**: Also dont really like him, only his face. I do have to admit I got flutters from him and his crying scene got me GOOD. Again, I didnt cry with him, more like DAMN HA SEOK JIN YOU LOOK GOOD CRYING CRY SOME MOREEE. I never got tired of him explaining his drinking habits and breathing into the breathalyzer. It reminds me of Lets Eat DooJoonie going into a food monologue (except DooJoons is better). I felt like his Sad Back Story came a little too late and I found out I didnt really care lol. 

**Ha Na and Trash Together**: Weak OTP with really weak and predictable relationship developments. Why are they together??! I do like that they relate to each other in enjoying a drink by themselves but that was about it on their connection Still got flutters because Im basic like that. ONE thing though we never got to hear him say I Love You so uhhhh FUCK THAT (btw it was waaay too early for them to say ILY they legit only started going out. Out of their fucking minds. But I want equality here. If she says it he has to say it too). ALSO I hate how he never once called her by proper name and went with No Geu Rae even after going out And the penultimate breakup that all drama have. At this point I am immune to them and assume its a checklist all kdramas are forced to shove in. The best parts were definitely the parts near that wine cave area where he justified everything for the joint class. I was also surprisingly pleased he came to his feelings/self-awareness rather quickly. Their scenes are surprisingly cute for a couple that has nearly nothing as a foundation xD I really loved the live broadcast where they were dancing. He was hamming it up so hard with that serious face!!! Also him being a High quality person drawing lines in the relationship and totally being the one breaking them in legit 1 second. I love that relationship reversal, SO CUTE. It was SO NICE seeing him be the one lose his cool and Ha Na was just cool af actually paying attention to the movie lol. Mike was the dog, dude!!!!

**Professor Min and Ha Nas friend**: Soft spot for him from Father is Strange, weirdly enough he got cuter towards the end and never once in FiS. The scene I teared up the most out of this whole drama was when they were crying in the car about the baby LOL. It was nice seeing them find each other, even if it was super obvious and if it was a drunken one night stand :x. I was told to be prepared to get my heart broken but Im a horrible person but I wasnt terribly affected by his mothers death WHOOPS. I think its because I still wasnt terribly attached to his character yet. He did get better after that! My heart did break a little when he went home to that cute puppy of his. WHICH WE DIDNT GET TO SEE AT THE END? UM DID HE GET RID OF IT? ~~I demand justice for puppy~~. Ha Nas friend was a really bad friend especially in the beginning. I never felt like she truly redeemed herself or that their relationship was ever equal. It was always Ha Na giving giving and giving. Dont ever get into those kinda relationships people. 

**Director** Had me laughing a couple times as a great side character but I also felt he was shallow. Idk, I just felt like he had a muuuuch more dynamic character in Chief Kim where he was also in a similar role and I cant get over that. I did like the relationship between him and Professor Min but it never got anywhere??

**Student Characters**

**Friend who got dumped at the beginning**: So hes back he where he was at the beginning, studying for the exam and has a GF. Tsk. His best parts were looking at that horrible love line from the outside. I am happy he got to actually live a little at the end and throw away the fucking yogurt lid (even if he didnt pass). I thought it was super weird they did nearly everyones eyebrows except for his.

**Kim Kibum** MY STAR. Motherfuking DIVA as hell and I LOVE IT. He was immature at times but boy did he slay me. KEY SO CUTE!!!!!! Especially when he was all dressed up for grandmas birthday. SO NICE. SHINee was the first kpop band I got REALLY into so Key has a special place in my heart <3 Okay lets stop the fangirling and get into his character (LIES, the rest of this paragraph is still fangirling): The part with his grandmother wins second place in tearing up ooof I just loved it and his crazy trot dance in the rain after that. He also slayed so hard in ALLL the dancing scenes which I knew he would be because Key is so good at girl dances. He also did some serious singing in the OST (DONT THINK DIDNT NOTICE KEY <3) which I very much approve. And the SHINee jokes with the Min Ho cameo and him dancing horribly to Lucifer on the chair. Lucifer was also the first kpop song I liked, so Im super attached. Makes me wanna queue up all my fave SHINee songs but Im still not over Jonghyun, and may never be, may he rest in peace :( Kibum wins FAVORITE CHARACTER DEFINITEly and such a scene stealer Key <3

**Kibum and that Jung Chae Yeon whose name I remember because he said it so many goddamn times**: Hes such a trooper, going from displaying his crush childishly and then sticking it through ending up showing his concern for her in a genuine way SQUEE <3 Girl was just ok, needs to remove the stick up her butt. Maybe Kibum can help her with that. 

**Gong Myung** Puppy puppy he melted my heart in the beginning being so puppy like. Just a great guy.. And I have nothing to say about him :D They were super cute in the beginning, but once Ha Na chose Trash he was just okay. 

**Our three bros together** Hmm their friendship didnt necessarily stand out to me, since I cant recall any scenes Maybe there were too many lol. I did remember liking some of them but I dont remember them D:

**Gong Myung and Trash**: Man it was such a weak part I hate how the bromance game in this drama is so bad. The extent to how they cared about each other was giving up on a girl without talking about it. OKAY OKAY OVER IT. I wouldve loved if they grew closer as brothers AND THEN FOUND OUT they liked the same girl and then get all indecisive choosing brothership over girl or something, like we only just got along after all these years, I dont want to risk it and tear my heart out :D I know thats what they did but it was on a basis of this one flashback Trash had with their mom about caring for his brother during their dads memorial. UM. Yeah no. Do a better job plz. This was the biggest disappointment for me, that they didnt develop the broship :( I guess we did get a decent bromance going on with the students but Im greedy and I want more. 

**Overall Thoughts** Im really sorry for being a bad binger and only dumping a wall of text at the end D: I did enjoy it and I shouldve popped in more since I heard its not that well received xD Luckily I am easily amused and overall had a good time! Honestly *thoroughly* entertained by this drama.

Something that I never quite tuned into was the more realistic bits. I wanted to like them because I'm trash for slice of life but it never really got to me. Except for Key's part. And I'm obviously not biased towards Key at all. 

I really really did enjoy! I listened to SHINee a lot in high school so rediscovering Key was amazing and totally worth it just for him. And I got some laughs out of this drama AND an awesome song and some low grade fluttering in my hands which is always appreciated! ",2018-05-24 04:58:16
125,"It was not Rhialta that greeted them. It was not the Lord Damion that met them.

Instead, it was a near tear-stricken woman with dark hair that just barely fell past her shoulders. Her lips were full, her dark clothes demure, and as the gate of Riverrun fell to welcome the men in, Alys Rivers could not believe what she was seeing.

The cart held her body.

The cart _held her_ body. 

If that wasnt enough to cause a fluttering in her chest, the kind that drilled anxiety into her so hard that she thought she might burst, then it was the sight of her, the bones, just underneath a thin layer of linen that kept her mostly obscured from most of the world.

_You havent even the grace to bring her to me with the skin on her bones?_

There was accusation in her eyes, but she spoke naught of it. Not when they came into the courtyard, nor when a crowd of men and women that came to surround the cart. Alys Rivers closed her eyes, one last long sigh  an apology, to a woman she had betrayed  filling the air.

Thank you, she said, her voice low, and quiet. Her head dipped low, and she feared that she might not be able to stand for a moment longer, but she held herself upright. From the bottom of our hearts, Ser Qyle. I, and all of Riverrun thank you. It is her, in the the cart?

127,"I have borne witness to many terrible events. Ends so horrible that normal men shudder at the mere thought of the possibility. Tragedies uncounted of bodies being piled one upon another. Many more horrors that leave no sign that someone was there. Yet more travesties involving family killing family. I have seen such atrocities that I am no longer fazed by it. Very rarely have I witnessed the beginnings of life, and fewer still that were joyful. Whenever I visit during someone's birth, it means another life has ended.

Worse yet, I can know when someone is to meet their end with a simple glance. The time they have left is displayed above their heads for us to see. It is sobering to know that someone you have just passed by has only moments left before they draw their final breath. Life is such a fragile thing, no one truly understands how thin that thread is. All it takes is but a simple fall and the thread snaps. A slight bump can set off an internal chain reaction that ultimately kills them. That's when I come to collect them. Regardless of age, race, gender, religion, status, health, or species, I will collect them one and all. Before us, such things have no meaning.

Today is no different. I have come to collect, and collect I shall. The appointed time is near, and I prepare myself for the reaping. My uniform is in perfect order, as it should be. The black cloak covers my ghastly form, obscuring most of my features. My scythe is sharp and ready to use.

I enter the room, decorated with the accessories and trimmings you would expect of someone at this stage of their life. Pink walls surround me, a small table with matching chairs set neatly by the door. Depictions of princesses adorned with beautiful dresses and jewelry are placed cleanly on the wall by her bed. In the bed, a little girl, no older than eight years of age, lies sleeping.

What I did not expect was the number floating above her head. Negative three thousand one hundred and ninety\-five. This was my first encounter with a negative number. She was meant to die eight years ago, during her birth. As I gaze upon her sleeping form, I am reminded of a tale that a fellow Reaper told me. A tale of a Reaper that went against his duty and granted life instead of ferrying them to their final rest. When they had arrived at their appointed time, they saw the one destined to die and were appalled by the sight that greeted them. A woman, giving birth, who still had ample time left to live and a baby, with only seconds to live. In that moment, the Reaper did the unthinkable, and granted the baby life in exchange for their existence.

I had chided the one who told me the story. There was no way that a Reaper would exchange their own existence for a single life, such a thing could not happen. And yet, the number does not lie. This story I believed to be a tall tale was in fact fiction.

As I watch her, her eyes flutter open. I step back, caught off guard. It seems as though she is looking directly at me, but this should not be possible. Then again, I just found out that life can be stranger than fiction, so it is entirely possible.

She sits up and asks, ""Are you a Reaper?""

I sigh and walk up to her bed, kneel down and place a hand next to her. ""Yes, I am.""

""Does that mean you've come to take me?""

I hesitate a moment. ""Yes, I have."" The child simply nods and lays back down. It seems like she has accepted her fate, unlike many others who lamented their ends before I took them. I stand up and ready myself. This is the moment I prepared myself for. Lifting the scythe up, I prepare to swing it and take what is meant to be taken.

And yet, I find myself unable to do it. No matter how much I try to swing, I cannot. It is as though another force is preventing me from taking her before she has had a chance to live fully. I kneel back down and sigh in resignation.

""What's wrong?"" She asks as she sits back up.

""Nothing is wrong, I have simply changed my mind.""

""Why?""

I chuckle slightly before answering. ""I realized that it is not yet your time, little one.""

""Why?""

""Because you are so young, you should have a chance to live. That is all.""

""Oh, okay."" She looks innocently at me, not questioning my sudden change of heart. ""Umm, Mr. Reaper?""

""Yes, little one?"" I look at her intently.

""Can you tuck me in? My mom usually tucks me in before I go to sleep."" If I could smile, I would.

""Of course, I can do that for you."" I set my scythe aside and tuck her in to go back to sleep. ""Rest now, little one. When next you wake, your mother will greet you kindly.""

""You're not as scary as the stories say you are."" She giggles before closing her eyes and going to sleep. Before I leave, I pull out an ancient obol and place it beneath her pillow. It seems that even the young can teach those older than themselves new things. Never have I had such a pleasant experience during my duties, it is refreshing.",2018-05-24 05:23:19

**Episode 13**

Didnt miss this intro even a little bit. Running this ship sober cause I'm too lazy to open the fridge a meter away from me. 

So this part of office romances when they try and fail at hiding their relationship might be my favorite part. They are winning a lot of brownie points in my eyes for doing this.

I'm so glad that she didn't go around forever thinking it was Baby Bae.

Yubu Chobap is kinda mediocre though... If it is like what I think it is.

I think she looks a billion times better with this minimalist makeup. I mean, yeah she'd sad that her boyfriend ghosted her to break up with her (dick move, btw), but she looks better like this.

OMG he's so bad at this. Imma enjoy this. Sooo much.

He's gonna trample all over that ""no overprotective and jealous"" thing himself. She will give zero fucks.

I could have sworn that my baby knew that there was another man in her life. I'm so confused. They totes changed the story so they could have this running bit, didn't they? Gross. 

Her former classmate works for a CJ affiliate. Lol. But like... Friend isn't wrong... I hate everything about this system. 

DUDE THAT BRACELET THOUGH! I LOVE EVERYTHING!

Cameo like WHAT WHAT!!!

Sorry Key, but you deserved that headbutt.

My heart flutters a little every time characters say ""revenge"" now...

Not even a little sad he found out. Besides the fact that it means any chance of bromance is COMPLETELY OUT and I'M DEFINITELY SALTY ABOUT THAT!

**Episode 14**

I enjoy the other characters' solo bits so much more than his. They're quiet and yet so much more moving.

They're all gonna end up falling asleep in his room, aren't they?

HOW DOES THE FACE MASK FIT HER SO WELL?! The amount of peanut butter and jelly I'm eating right now is downright dangerous. And then she just rips it off?! THIS BITCH!

Stupid question, but why is the director so involved with these four teachers. He has tons more ""teachers"" on his staff... I hate these kinds of conveniences for the drama.

HE PLANNED TO WEAR YELLOW PANTS FOR THEIR DATE! I LOVE THIS MAN! 

Look at his hiking hair! I mean his whole getup is something else, but his hair is that finishing touch to the whole silly thing and I love it.

We all know it's some quality shit you're all wearing.

WHY IS KEY SO WONDERFUL?!

**Episode 15**

IT'S DIA MEMBERS! I LOVE THIS! AND I DON'T EVEN LIKE DIA THAT MUCH! Only just realized that she was in DIA. I knew she was an idol I just couldn't remember which one. Tote only called it when I saw DIA rapper though. 

He's doing the Director now. Wonderful. Saving the best for last!

It's disappointing, but I kinda don't like either of these dudes for her. Baby worships the ground she walks on and that's not healthy, and HQT still treats her like a doormat so he's obvs not great either (says from a professed *Itazura Na Kiss* obsessed). Just be single. Find someone else. Anything else.

I can't remember which episode I noticed this, but he has a FULL BOTTLE at a restaurant or bar in front of him. He probably PAID FULL BAR PRICE FOR A BOTTLE but didn't drink it all cause he doesn't do that low *quality* shit.

Yeah bitch. You got between two brothers. Start crying now. You ruined any chance of brotherly bonding they might have had.

I kinda love him being an asshole FOR the younger brother, but at the same time I still hate both options. 

**Episode 16** THE END IS FINALLY EXTREMELY FUCKING NIGH! I actually titled my notes ""Drinking Solo 13-THE END IS FINALLY EXTREMELY FUCKING NIGH"" I'm so happy we done. 

And I just finished my alcohol with his impersonation. But like, I don't regret it even a little bit. Zero regerts. 

You really think he's not gonna figure it out on his own? He's not an idiot, he just does bad impersonations! Okay, never mind. He is an idiot. 

NOOO!!!! HE'S GONNA MISS THE LECTURE TO GO SEE HER IN THE HOSPITAL!! NOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!! 
Oh bless, he didn't miss it. Oh bless.

QUIET BITCH! HE'S SO HAPPY RIGHT NOW! So invested in these two that I totes didn't even care about cause the main triangle is so shitty. Also incredibly invested in Key and DIA. But like, duh. It's Key.

Is u/dancing-ahjumma incredibly questioning the ""all that they have in common with each other is they like drinking alone"" nonsense of their relationship? Cause I'll be honest, it's probably the least sense reason why they should be together. Even I think it's stupid.

WHY DID THEY HAVE TO HAVE A BROTHER LOVE TRIANGLE?! DRINKING BECAUSE OF THIS LOW QUALITY BULLSHIT! (totes gonna continue using quality in stuff now...)

I'm disappointed there wasn't totes on alcohol PPL tbh. Whoever was paying for this shit did a bad job. ALL THE WASTED OPPORTUNITIES!

AGAIN WITH HIS ""LEAVE THE BOTTLE"" SHIT! I know he makes all this money, but it still kills me.

I am so upset that my baby failed. Like, soooo upset. I had a feeling, but I desperately wanted to be wrong. THE BURDEN ON HIS FAMILY! I just, couldn't one of them be happy and no longer a burden on their family?! He actually wants it! This pisses me off more than you could possibly even know.

like the mom of my best friend, I'm not rude but if something was too salty/spicy or no flavor at all I told her. but when I say something is good boy she's happy.

or when friends send me pics of dresses from the changing room and I'm like: ""this one makes your ass big"" ""this one makes you look like a crackwhore"" ""ohh this one looks really cute on you!""

instead of the whole ""omg! they are all good looking but the last one is so cute :)))"" bullshit.

teach kids honesty but without rudeness. I want to hear constructive criticism when I'm doing something so I can fix it!",2018-05-24 10:04:56

151,"[](/twicrazy) This time next week, I'll be doing the exam. Bake four different things in seven hours.

I'm not stressed at all. Nope, not one bit!

[](/sp)

[](/flutteryay) In significantly less stressful news, Lordi's releasing their new album Sexorcism, tomorrow. I'm super hyped for that. I know what I'll be talking about next recommendation thread.

_____________________________________________

>What just drives you crazy?

[](/twibeam) You drive me crazy, I just can't sleep

I'm so excited, I'm in too deep

Woa-ah, crazy! But it feels alright

Baby, thinking of you keeps me up all night

[](/sp)

[](/ppboring) Aaaanyway... To actually answer the question.

[](/sp)

[](/spikemeh) Bullshit. Misinformation, blissful ignorance, whatever you wanna call it. It can seriously drive me up the wall.

It begins with the small stuff. You know the kind of stuff people parrot around. Like when someone thinks octopi is the correct plural for octopus. Or when a dictionary includes the wrong definition of words like 'literally', because apparently grammar is a fucking free for all and all rules can be bent by any idiot if there's enough of them.

[](/sp)

[](/spikewtf) Remember the viral sensation of cats being scared of cucumbers? Remember how the most popular explanation became the one about the cat thinking it's a snake? Well, that's just bullshit. Cats eat snakes! Seriously, put a long wiggly thing in front of a cat and they'll attack it. They're not afraid of snakes. The ancient Egyptians loved cats, because they get rid of pests *including* snakes. The real explanation is really quite simple. Imagine you're having a meal. You finish, get up and turn around and suddenly there's a big green thing in your face. You'd shit your pants as well.

But no, we have to believe whatever some ignorant schmuck tells us, because we're too dumb to use our own brains and think about stuff a single fucking minute and see the obvious.

[](/sp)

[](/twipbbt) Oh, and there's the second level bullshit, the esoteric bullshit. I mean, I can see how one can delude themselves into believing their horoscopes and stuff like that. I used to believe that as well, until I realized I don't actually have any reason to do so.

But no, I mean the alternative medicine bullshit and the self-help bullshit. They take the inherent cool factor of ancient exotic cultures and bait you to believe something, *that might actually harm you*. Because my baby's down with the whooping cough and I ain't gonna give them actual medicine. No, I'm gonna shove coffee up their ass and feed them shiny rocks, because I'd rather see them dead than an autist.

[](/sp)

[](/flutterbrow) And how can you be stupid to believe scientifically devised cures that have went through rigorous testing. No, that shit makes you even more sick and make you buy more cure *that actually works* and line the pockets of big pharma companies. Did you know it's that shit is exactly what gives you cancer. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got some mercury to pour into the town's water supply and holes to burn into my own fucking face!

[](/sp)

[](/ajugh) Oh, and don't even get me started on these conspiracy theories. Yeah, I get it, it's fun to think about what the world would be like if the weather was controlled by chemtrails. But when you actually start to believe that sort of shit come the big fucking problems.

Because a building collapsing due to getting bashed on its side with a plane makes no sense, but an ancient order with varying competence in keeping secrets makes total sense. Because, as you know, the Hungarians, didn't come from central Asia, like it's been proven. No, they already existed in Europe before even the fucking Sumer civilization.

[](/sp)

[](/sbstare) And of course you never heard of that theory, because *they* don't want you to know about it! And by *they* I mean the jews and Soros and whomever the fuck else I've been told to hate today. Because unlike you I'm smart. You're just a gullible fool, with your wikipedias and googles and academically approved knowledge. I get my knowledge from some neo-nazi and whatever fractals of fucking nonsense they believe.

Now I'm gonna buy whatever the fuck Alex fucking Jones sells me, because he's totally not a charlatan who exploits my hatred, by weaving a huge web of complete nonsense, where reality just so happens to line up with whatever I believe.

[](/sp)

[](/ohcomeon) I mean how the fuck can anyone be so fucking stupid and gullible to believe such insane batshit fucking nonsense?!

[](/sp)

________________________________________________________

[](/ppboring) After that lengthy and not at all psychotic rant, let's talk about music.

And today, we have **Noidz**, a so called Trance Metal band.

[](/sp)

[](/scootaplease) Now there have been many attempts at fusing trance music with metal. And I'm not talking about psytrance that includes some metal riffs. I mean bands who also do this so called trance metal majig. There are quite a few of them to go around.

[](/sp)

[](/scootablue) But they all suck.

[](/sp)

[](/rscootacheer) Except for this one. The track [Alienoidz Theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sexhhZ0fBT0) is a great start here. It kind of sounds like the previously mentioned metal infused psytrance. But this one goes further, by actually being creative with their musical elements. It's both great trance music and great metal. A successful fusion of trance and metal.

But of course, they aren't confined to a single sound. They also make great party anthem sort of trance metal, like [Root Sounds from Earth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tco6qC5KdFo) which even includes bagpipes! And here's [We Have Arrived](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaJaRoYDZ70) which almost sounds like some sort of nu metal from the times when nu metal actually had something going for it and wasn't utter garbage. I mean the bass even has a significant role in it. And for something more unconventional, here's [Sonic Boom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNBsRnt7ZYE), where the band's experimental side really shines.

[](/sp)

[](/dj) So, that's Noidz for you, a very creative band that defined its own gimmick and plays around with it, constantly putting out inventive musical ideas. Out of the small but significant trance metal scene, this is the only band worth checking out.",2018-05-24 10:48:47

158,"Exactly, you must always follow your dreams. You see, I often get up in the morning and just do the same old routine. Have a shit, brush my teeth and fuck off to work. Rinse and repeat for most of the week. Naturally, having weekends off is great. Come summer I always go out for walks in the beautiful country side, admiring the cows grazing in the everflowing green listening to the songs of birds chattering away and feeling the warm breeze caress me. Of course in winter time, I like to put on multiple layers and be able to see my breath fluttering away. Pick up snow, when available and feel the texture. Other seasons I enjoy seeing the maple brown of autumn laid out across the land and hear the rustling of leaves across the pavements followed by the crunch underneath my boot. Most of the time though it is the same, year in, year out. Another year and still the same social status.

I like to dream. Dream of being taken away by a lovely wife. Someone who wants me for who I am. I like to dream, dream of being in the clouds and feeling the cotton candy between my fingers being able to lay my head across them. I like to dream, dream of adventure, sky diving out of an aeroplane, Bond style. Climbing the ice cream coated rocks of a mountain, hiking through the dusty out back of Australia or even being taken by awe of the pyramids of Egypt. Sometimes these dreams include people, other times just myself.

Sometimes, though, I dream of Jack down the road. Not in a sexual way or anything but I do dream that sometimes we can be better acquainted. Sort out our quarrels over whose wood that is in the skip just down the road. Just being friends, you know?

We could have a conversation about how that is probably unhealthy, but that does not preclude that it still exists as a social norm with many people still.  I'm not trying to blame the victim here, men should still be making sure they understand the dynamic before trying again, but I still think there are degrees of wrongness due to miscommunication.

[](/starlightspittle) I'm not sure. I don't tend to think about that sort of thing, characters just kind of write themselves and I don't put in any flaws consciously. Though I did have Starlight get into trouble, by trying to stay out of trouble, or keep Trixie out of trouble. I really like to play up her ex-villainousness. ",2018-05-24 19:43:08

232,"That Dirty Snape

""What did you expect, you little tart?"" Snape snarled against Hermione's ear as he gripped her throat with one long-fingered hand, his hooked nose pressed into her temple, his lank hair curtaining his face. ""Kindness? Gentleness? No, you couldn't have thought that.""

They stood in his study, both naked, the torchlight low and sputtering, casting flickering shadows over the books that lined the walls. A small fire burned in the hearth, and the air was warm, dry and slightly cloying. There was no sound other than Snape's silken voice and the crackling of flames.

A threadbare green couch rested nearby

Snape yanked Hermione's head back by her bushy hair and released her throat. His hand slipped over one breast, then her belly, then cupped her pussy possessively, his palm curved against her pubic hair. Hermione gasped, her throat exposed, then shivered as he slowly ran his tongue over her jugular, tasting her.

""For all your brains, Hermione Granger,"" he breathed in her ear again, ""you're a slut. A filthy, little Gryffindor slut. Do you know that?""

He slid one finger between the folds of her moist lower lips and felt her shudder as he massaged her clit slowly.

""Do you know that? Answer me!"" he demanded.

""Yes.""

""Yes what?""

""Yes, I'm a filthy little Gryffindor slut.""

Snape made a noise at her answer, a kind of guttural sound that rose from the back of his throat. Once again he pressed his mouth against her neck, and spoke, his lips moving against her skin. Hermione could feel the warmth of his breath against her flesh.

""Ever since you replaced Flitwick here at Hogwarts, you've been coming down to the dungeons night after night to 'engage me in conversation.' But I knew, I knew that wasn't the type of engagement you wanted at all""

He yanked her hair and Hermione let out another little gasp. Snape's black eyes glittered.

""I've never been yourfriend, yet you continued to violate my space. Continued to force your presence on my person. The only conclusion I could come to was you wanted me to give you a good fucking. Why else would you keep coming down here?""

""You never objected"" Hermione managed to get out as her eyelids fluttered. Snape was talented at twiddling twat.

""You silly woman. Why would I object, particularly if my conclusion was correct? Tonight shows it is. Otherwise, you would have run screaming when I removed your clothing with a flick of my wand. You didn't protest. You simply stared at me, wordlessly, even when I removed my own garments. And now, I'm fingering you, tugging on your hair and still not a word of protest. I would have never taken you for a submissive""

Suddenly, Snape slapped Hermione's pussy and she cried out and jerked, her eyes watering, but an odd light igniting in them. Snape returned his finger to her clit.

""Or a masochist,"" he breathed, a sneer on his lips. ""You twisted piece of fluff.""

Hermione made a noise something like a whimper as he mocked her.

You're here because you want some mature cock,"" Snape hissed at her in a voice dripping with venom. ""Don't you?""

Hermione squirmed as his finger continued to rub.

""Answer me, you bloody harlot! You want mature cock!""

""Yes,"" Hermione said weakly, her hips beginning to roll helplessly.

""Yes what?""

""Yes, I want mature cock.""

""I know you do. You're rolling against my cock and soaking my finger,"" he breathed, pressing into her harder and slipping another digit between her folds. ""You randy little bird.""

Hermione began to writhe harder with the addition of the next finger. Snape had caught her clit between his digits and was now diddling both fingers up and down. The sensation was intense, nearly too much He still held her by the hair, her throat exposed. He pressed his soft, thin lips against the pulsing artery again, moving them slightly.

Now he brought his naked body into contact with her, his hard cock rubbing against her hip lustfully. The Potions master was so slender, one could see the outline of his ribs, and so pale his body seemed nearly corpse-like in color. He continued fingering Hermione, who let out a little moan.

""Wizards your own age don't do it for you, do they? What are you? Twenty-four, now?""

""Twenty-five,"" she said.

Snape removed his fingers from her twat and stuck them into her mouth. She didn't resist as he twisted them about then pulled down on her jaw, opening her mouth. He spit into it, just a little spittle, then closed it, his face contorted.

""I can do anything to you, can't I?"" he hissed, squeezing her cheeks between his fingers, forcing her mouth into an ""o"" and jerking her face towards his. ""You're nothing but a plaything. A cockhole. A breathing toy with three willing orifices with which to pleasure myself any way I please. WellI play rough, Hermione Granger. But you knew that, didn't you?""

Hermione didn't reply. She couldn't because of his grip on her face, but her brown eyes were liquid as she looked at him. Suddenly, Snape let go of her cheeks and slapped one, then grasped her throat again, applying pressure. Hermione choked a little, Snape's eyes lighting up at the little cough as he relaxed his grip.

""Get down on your blasted knees!"" he growled, yanking her hair and using it to roughly guide Hermione to her knees on the cold, stone floor. He slapped her cheek lightly several times then ground his cock into her face lewdly, rotating his loins.

Hermione gasped, feeling his hardness rolling over her face, pressing against her nose and mouth, feeling the soft pubic hairs around his cock rubbing against her. His cock was hot and rigid, the foreskin sliding about as he abused her, hissing with pleasure, his fingers still locked in her hair.

He pulled her away, yanking on her hair so she looked up at him, his sharp features and narrowed eyes. His mouth was twisted in a sneer as he slapped her face again. Her cheeks were reddened. Then he caught hold of her nose, squeezing it shut so her mouth was forced to open.

""Suck my cock, you slapper,"" he growled, pulling her forward by her nose and letting out a groan as her mouth slipped over him. He shoved his cock deep into her mouth, releasing her nose so he could hold the back of her head, gagging her as her nose touched his pelvis. He held her that way for a second or two, then pulled out, his cock coated in mucous, a long string stretching between her mouth and his shaft.

""Again!"" he hissed, pulling her back over him, forcing his cock in completely, Hermione coughing up phlegm now, and covering his erection in thick fluid as it ran down her chin and over her breasts.

""Yes, you are a nasty witch,"" Snape breathed, giving her a chance to breathe before shoving his cock back between her warm, wet and gooey lips, seeking to dip the head back into that tight, gulping throat.

""I don't think you'll be visiting me again after tonight, Hermione,"" he said softly as he gagged her a third time. ""You'll have your fill of me, and then some.""

A/N: Wow. Nastiest Snape yet for me. (If you don't count Remorse) Lol. Actually, I was trying to stimulate my muse by writing something different. She's hiding out on me on Looping, so I did this and decided to post it for reactions if nothing else. Don't know if it will be continued. I finished the comparative essay on the Aeneid this morning, so that's a couple of bucks coming my way. It's been taking up my time because I never read the Aeneid, so, had to wade through that. Hopefully, I'll have some Looping up soon. If my muse is shocked enough to make an appearance. Thanks for readin

233,"I have a Classic AK and a Lightweight M4 that are both godly rolls, Determined in the Free slot, Responsive top talent and My AK I can roll Accurate off the middle for Destructive or Ferocious if I wanted to, and my M4 already had Destructive in the middle slot. 

Of the two, I find the AK has been significantly better for my play style. I like to get Predator's Mark to apply huge bleeds, and there's really no better way than slamming 7.62x39mm into them at 650 RPM. I apply Bleeds that are genuine chunks out of enemies, especially big ones. 

That being said, the M4 is the superior weapon over all, I just hate the feel of it. I can't put my finger on why it feels so light and fluttery. There's just no punch behind it. It does, however, shred enemies better than anything else in my arsenal and I can't deny its power.",2018-05-24 20:30:46

That said, I think Fluttershy is also a character whose personality is attractive to a lot of people, and by nature we have a tendancy to to see people as we imagine them.

I think there's something about her character and behaviour that makes that kind of appearance appealing. It may be that on some level people identify a strong potential mother for their family, and attribute those characteristics as a result.

237,">What characters have you been itching to write for a while now that you've just not had the time or chance to as of yet?

Screw Loose.

>There is another good one, have there been any crossover stories that you've thought of writing?

Actually kind of a similar thought. I want to do two playthorughs(DS1 and DS2), then write about the DS1 character, who would be a reluctant Darkwraith and the DS2 character(a Blue Sentinel) permanently torn away from their worlds during their lowest moments and thrown(ponified) into Equestria.

>I suppose another good question might be what kind of flaws do you like your characters to have/write for? 

Any flaw, the more the merrier. In fact, my first fanfic(it got pretty positive, if scarce, responses, but I'm currently rewriting to remove my first blunders at humour, which I feel take away from it) is focused on each of the Mane6(sans Fluttershy, who is literally perfect and didn't let her problems take hold of her[](/flutterblush)) dealing with a deep seated issue(aggression for RD, feelings of inadequacy for Applejack; tendency to assume the worst in situations/ponies for Rarity; over-reliance on friends as a mental stability support for Pinkie).

Every flaw is difficult to work with, IMO. Too much of a flaw and it becomes hard to believe. This is what my fanfic portrays: character flaws(that I perceive or guess in the Mane6) exaggerated to the point it prevents ponies from functioning. Aggression turns into unstoppable rage. Feelings of inadequacy turn into all-consuming self-hatred. Tendency to assume the worst can easily lead to the most regrettable decisions. Over-reliance on friends will see you spiral into depression the moment you think your friends have abandoned you. But, these work fine if they are passing and portrayed as the lowest moment. What isn't fine is making said exaggerated flaw the very core of the character in your fanfic.",2018-05-24 20:59:26

244,"I have only sparred shorter guys than me (I'm tall and the only people who box in my area are of average height) so here are some tips I can share. Flutter jabs work really well especially if they use the peek-a-boo style, just fire off you're right/power hand when you start landing your jab or when they try to slip to the side to start closing the distance. Philly shell stance really negates their ability to land body shots but you have to seriously watch out for left hooks and overhand rights. Learning to move backwards, to the side, and at an angle is really helpful as it allows you to keep out of their range, throwing left hooks or jabbing to the body as counters while moving backwards is really effective against a more aggressive fighter as well. As for offense when your opponent is shelled-up going to the body is pretty effective, personally I throw a few light punches up high before I throw a few hard shots to the body. Hope these help I'm learning myself as well and I have had and still have some of the same issues. Have fun boxing and good luck.",2018-05-24 22:05:35

247,"I have experience with both of those brands and they put a lot of work into designing paddles with good hydraulic performance.  A well-designed paddle is going to result in a more pleasant experience for the paddler, with less fatigue and joint strain, because it reduces flutter and vibration as well as translating a larger proportion of the effort you expend into forward motion so that you just get more out of each stroke.  

Lots of people are happy with other brands.  Aquabound has been around for a while and makes some seemingly decent lower-end paddles, but I don't have experience with them so I can't vouch for them.  They may be a viable lower priced option.  Same with Bending Branches; they seem to be very popular among recreational boaters, but I can't see why.  The quality doesn't seem markedly better than the big-box-store junk I often see newbies assaulting fish with.  

I guess you could take my statements with a grain of salt as I'm a bit of an elitist snob when it comes to kayaking.  I don't have a lot of patience for cheap gear.  Been there, done that - briefly.  Now when I want to save money I buy used.  I would never for a moment consider a metal-shaft paddle.  I'm not totally opposed to plastic blades but I generally spend the slight premium for fiberglass.  Personally I prefer fiberglass over carbon for blades, but I like carbon for shafts.  Really I'd be happy with a fiberglass shaft but nobody makes a high end paddle that isn't a carbon shaft.  

My favorite paddle for flat water is my Werner Camano which is around $250.  The Skagit is essentially the same design with a plastic blade, so just a little heavier but perhaps better for hitting rocks with, and can be found online for right about $100.  The Baja is even cheaper, but oddly I'm not seeing any deals on it with a Google search - the Skagit has a $120 MSRP and there are a few listings under $105, but the Baja is listed at $89 on Werner's site but $90 and up on Google shopping.  I'd see if I could find a Baja for $70 or so, that would get you pretty close to your budget target while giving you a markedly better paddling experience.  

Werner paddles are also American made with a great warranty.  You won't get either of those factors with a non-name paddle.",2018-05-24 22:13:58

He pulled her away, yanking on her hair so she looked up at him, his sharp features and narrowed eyes. His mouth was twisted in a sneer as he slapped her face again. Her cheeks were reddened. Then he caught hold of her nose, squeezing it shut so her mouth was forced to open.

""Suck my cock, you slapper,"" he growled, pulling her forward by her nose and letting out a groan as her mouth slipped over him. He shoved his cock deep into her mouth, releasing her nose so he could hold the back of her head, gagging her as her nose touched his pelvis. He held her that way for a second or two, then pulled out, his cock coated in mucous, a long string stretching between her mouth and his shaft.

""Again!"" he hissed, pulling her back over him, forcing his cock in completely, Hermione coughing up phlegm now, and covering his erection in thick fluid as it ran down her chin and over her breasts.

""Yes, you are a nasty witch,"" Snape breathed, giving her a chance to breathe before shoving his cock back between her warm, wet and gooey lips, seeking to dip the head back into that tight, gulping throat.

""I don't think you'll be visiting me again after tonight, Hermione,"" he said softly as he gagged her a third time. ""You'll have your fill of me, and then some.""

A/N: Wow. Nastiest Snape yet for me. (If you don't count Remorse) Lol. Actually, I was trying to stimulate my muse by writing something different. She's hiding out on me on Looping, so I did this and decided to post it for reactions if nothing else. Don't know if it will be continued. I finished the comparative essay on the Aeneid this morning, so that's a couple of bucks coming my way. It's been taking up my time because I never read the Aeneid, so, had to wade through that. Hopefully, I'll have some Looping up soon. If my muse is shocked enough to make an appearance. Thanks for readin

259,"It's actually quite easy. If you're following the method used in big companies, you need to 

1. Prepare a very informal Requirements document just listing what all your product should be able to do.
 
 An example of a Requirement/Feature that can be listed for an application like WhatsApp would be
""As a User, I need the ability to send messages to contacts on my phone""

2. The next step would be to prepare and assemble all the raw materials required for building a prototype. For building a prototype in the software world, you'd need to first finalize on the tech stack. 

 For example, If you're building a mobile application, Flutter would be a good choice for prototyping and prepare a proof of concept in record time

3. Another way to go about this would be to make a prototype in tools where no code has to be written. 

 Example: UXPin, Indigo Studio, Illustrator(If you're good at it)

 One HUGE advantage you have with the above-mentioned prototyping tools is that you get to show the prototype to people on your phone. It is the closest thing to the real application. Interactions and Animations can be configured to mimic the exact same behavior of the real application. ",2018-05-24 22:46:20

266,"Maybe this is a little late, but I'll give you some more ideas.  I do a lot of core and abs exercises.

>I don't have such place to do dragon flag (actually I have but it's very unconvienient). I have bar, 2 dumbbels, ab wheel, parallettes.

**Dragon Flags** - all you need is a bench, a box with a towel on top and place it next to a vertical pole or a place where you can grab on to something like balusters on a railing.  My pictures will show you examples.  I think you should get creative since you're missing out on a great core and abs exercise here.


1. See my **[Dragon Flag Library](https://www.flickr.com/photos/158235604@N08/albums/72157693589833172)** for any inspiration on bench or box DFs.  Let me know if you have any questions.  You can always make them more challenging with adding ankle weights, doing flutter kicks, stack holds at horizontal, etc etc.  I can give you lots of ideas.

**Ab Wheel** - many variations to consider:

1. Kneeling - max ROM chest to floor for reps
2. Standing - much harder, begin with negatives and go for a [max ROM and hold at this position](https://flic.kr/p/24p4E6h) and it will work your abs - try for longer holds and then drop.  Begin again and do slow and control roll-outs.
3.  Standing - roll out 3/4 ROM and then pull back to standing, if you go to the floor or nearly horizontal, see above, it is practically impossible to have the leverage and power to pull backward.
4.  You don't have a barbell, but if you had a barbell you could do barbell rollouts with 185lbs (for example) and that is tough too.
5.  Kneeling with only one arm - these are hard to get a negative to horizontal and then pull back to the start.  Starting with only the negatives.
6.  Standing one arm - these are very tough, ...
7.  Standing one leg, two arms - hard
8.  Standing - one leg, one arm - hard
9. ...

**Inverted Sit-ups** - if you can find monkey bars and you can do these safely this is a great core/abs exercise and you can make it more difficult by holding a weight.  Be careful, it can be dangerous.

**Hanging Leg raises**

1.  You need to have straight arms, and no swing or mometum.  Then you can do leg raises with striahgt arms to 90 deg, or 90 to 180 deg for reps (harder), or add ankle weights.  I've done +5lbs and +10lbs for strict leg raises and they are tough ... I can only do 2x10 reps but they will tire out your arms too!

**Hanging Window wipers** 

1.  Straight legs an toes pointed, do 180 deg sweeps or [270  deg sweeps (much harder)](https://imgur.com/a/INdBN).  
2.  Add ankle-weights to any of these variations and they become harder.

**Hollow Body Holds / Rocks**

1.  I would do 60 sec hollow body holds with striahgt legs and towes pointed and arms behind head outstretched.  You can add weight on your feet to make this harder.  Try 60 secs work, 30-60 secs rest for time.
2.  Hollow Rocks (same form, arms outstetched behind your head - I would do 30 secs work, 30 secs rest for 10 rounds (10 mins).  This will make your abs scream - seriously.  Try this routine and tell me how your abs feel. :).

Spade?

""Yes, all the excavations are awarded spades on the first expedition. Old land-wear-poor tradition. But do not you want to get blisters on your gracila piano fingers?

""Nja de ...""

""And then you're actually only passengers ... and rich man son. You get a goose pin instead. We all thought that suited you better!

* Functionally it doesn't match the native platforms, if I double-tap some text it should select it and then bring up ""cut/copy/paste"" like I expect, instead I have to do a long-press.
* You can select new-line characters. Write some text on a line, then hit enter a few times to add a single empty line, then write some more text on a 3rd line. If you move the cursor to the 2nd blank line and long-press to paste some text, you've effectively ""selected"" the invisible new-line character and so when you paste you end up deleting it and your pasted text gets ""merged"" with the 3rd line.
* Sometimes when I paste text into an edit-text that has a scroll, it scrolls the text all the way to the top.

283,"   It was a faint but definite memory in my mind. My young innocent eyes wandered towards the window when a flash caught my attention. It was a flash of a beautiful deep purple. Although quick, it was enough time for me to identify that it was something... otherwordly. That's the only memory I have of my life that I feel like I never got closure on. When I was a year old, I had developed a sickness. My parents took me to the hospital in a rush, terrified that something could be terribly wrong. The doctor did some tests and concluded I had asthma, told my parents to get me an asthma mask, and if it got worse, to bring me back in.


   It did get worse, and the doctors were stumped. They did hundreds of allergen tests, and I reacted to none of them. When we took a trip a few states away to visit family, my parents were baffled when my coughing and wheezing stopped completely. They immediately arranged for us to move to the same state. The day before we moved is the day of the memory. 


Well, when I turned 18 I immediately packed some clothes and went on a road trip to my first home. The wheezing took hold of my lungs as I walked up the old, but familiar stairs. The house was dilapidated now. It was in such a remote location so now it was a home to huge, overgrown weeds that we're bustling with life. Butterflies of beautiful colors fluttered arround the leaves and bees sunbasked in the flowers. Every breath I took was more and more strained and my eyes started to water and my nose got stuffy. I heard a slight rustle in the weeds, and then.... 


   There it was. A small, sleek purple.. dragon curled up amongst the weeds. The light glinted off it's scales and cast beautiful purple shimmers on the cracked, falling walls. It opened it's big, emerald eyes and just looked at me nonchalantly. It slowly blinked, and then rolled over and curled up again. Suddenly I got overwhelmed with emotions.. or allergies. Or both.

[](/pinkiesad)Pinkie's characterization definitely hit a low point, but for me, it was during seasons 3 and 4. During this time, her solo episodes remained fairly strong, but any episode that featured her in a supporting role reduced her to a gag machine that did little more than spout random unfunny jokes and shout lines unnecessarily.

[](/sp)

[](/pinkieooh)However, I actually feel that Pinkie's overall characterization *improved* starting with season 5 and continuing on to now. I actually went through every episode from seasons 5 to 7 that feature Pinkie in any way and judged her portrayal in each of them. In short, I found that the good majority of episodes that featured Pinkie, whether they be her own episodes or ones where she is a side character, portrayed her well.

[](/sp)

[](/ppreally)Has her post-season 4 run been perfect? Absolutely not. The writers *definitely* still slip up from time to time, such as in episodes like ""Newbie Dash"", ""Flutter Brutter"", and the aforementioned ""All Bottled Up"" and ""Rock Solid Friendship"". In addition, I'm also not a fan of the rather excessive shouting that she seems to do in more recent seasons. It's a problem that tends to crop up even in episodes where Pinkie's characterization was otherwise well done.

[](/sp)

[](/pinkie)All that being said, I can think of far more episodes in seasons 5 through 7 where Pinkie's characterization was handled well as opposed to poorly.

293,"Miraculously, my room was untouched like Mom had said. After I set my bag down and removed my shoes and socks I laid on the bed with my arm over my eyes for a few minutes, simply breathing in and out while\> I wanted to try and make this make sense. My parents were naked. My parents had given up TV. My parents were, unless my senses failed me, smoking weed.  Oh right and they were naked. All that enough, without that weird....whatever it was that past over me when I looked at mom. I made a conscience decision to ignore and forget whatever that was. I had enough to process and I was suddenly very tired and hungry.

As I laid there, thinking about some things and not thinking about others, I realized the flute music had stopped and now, faintly outside I could hear what sounded like drums being played and light, melodic chanting. I sighed and moved my hand slowly. What in the hell was this now? Not really wanting to I forced myslef up and out of the room. I went out to the top of the stairs. ""Hello?"" I called down. I took a few steps down, worried about what I'd see when I walked around the corner. ""Hellooo?"" I asked again, as I reached the bottom. No one answered, but the sounds got louder. Rounding the corner, I went past the dining room and living room, spotting new pottery and painting on the walls as I did until I reached the kitchen and looked out the clear sliding door to the patio and backyard. I stared  for a few seconds, taking in the scene silently before muttering ""Oh my goooood...."" to myself.

The picnic table on the patio was set for three. The fire pit was lit up, a grill placed over it, covered in roasting corn and burger patties. Dad was sitting on the grass beside the fire, cross legged, still naked, with a large tight drum between his legs. He was beating the drum rapidly in a loose rhythm, while he chanted a low string of what sounded like gibberish. ""Umbumbowa...Mella tikka... om...mella tikka....Umbumbowa..."" Mom meanwhile was also there. She was also naked of course, standing by the edge of the fire pit her hands up over her head, twisting and turning them, her hips swaying back and forth as her feet moved slowly in a circle. HEr eyes were closed and she was smiling to herself as she muttered her own nonsense. ""Mumbewah....umbewhba....mmbobya...""

Shaking my head in disbelief I opened the door and stepped out. Looking directly at them was still a challenge. I managed to point my head in their generally direction without focusing on their bodies. I cleared my thoat. ""Ahem, hey..""

They both stopped and looked over. ""Oh hey son, you're right on time!"" Dad said, standing up.

""Mmm your father started the fire and it just suddenly felt like a moment for dancing!"" Mom said walking over and wiping sweat off her forehead, her cheeks flushed from the heat. She took Dad's hand as they walked back to the patio. 

""Sooo...you guys dance...naked...to drums...around fires...outside."" I said flatly, still only half looking at them.

Dad Chuckled, ""Yep...I guess we should start explaining some things, have a seat Bill."" Dad said and gestured towards the picnic table. I just signed and nodded resignedly as I sat down.

Then, over the course of a few veggie burgers on whole\-wheat buns, roasted corn and quinoa, mom and dad explained what they'd been up to over the past few months. Evidently mom had started taking a new Hot Yoga class. It was in this class that she met her new friend ""Willow"". They talked at the class everyday, about kids, work vegetarianism, books, really hitting it off. Eventually, Willow invited mom and dad over for a party. It was then that the Nudism came up.

""We were pretty taken back at first as well at first"" Dad said, between sips of beer.

""Oh yeah, in hindsight we were so uptight and puritanical about it. Seeing all that skin on display when we walked in the first time, it was quite a shock to our delicate sensibilities."" Mom added, shaking her head and laughing at her foolishness. 

""But they were all so friendly and accepting. Once we stopped judging with our eyes instead of our ears and we really began to listen to them. It all really made sense.""

Enough sense apparently that mom and dad eventually started joining in, and going to more functions, meeting new people. It wasn't long before it was an all the time thing when they were at home or over friends. They donated most of their clothes to a charity, keeping just the bare essentials each for when they had to go to town.  Since both of them pretty much workAnd it wasn't just the nudity.

""We started to learn a lot"" Dad said. ""About the food we've been eating, the media we've consumed, about love and friendship."" He said, gently resting his hand over Mom's and smiling. Mom giggled and smiled back at him coquettishly.  Something about that exchange made my stomach flutter again.

""Wait a second..."" I said pushing back my plate. ""Are you talking about...like, swinging?!""

""Oh no, no no!"" Dad said shaking his head firmly. 

""No, we would never do that. Not Swinging dear, free love."" Mom corrected and ran her arm over Dad's arm. Dad nodded. 

""Right, Swinging is just about sex. What we do is about love.""

I shook my head. ""So you mean you...and you...with other people?! How could you?!""

Mom and dad look at each other and shrugged. ""Once you get over the petty restraints of Victorian western morality son it's not too hard. I realized that I don't own your mother. I don't own her love or her sexuality.""

""But...you're married..."" I said aghast.

""And we still love each other, very much, nothing about that has changed dear."" Mom said patiently. ""It's just that out eyes were opened. Marrying a person doesn't change who you are in the world. I am still a woman. Your father is still a man. We have love we want to give out to the world.""

""That's right. I give my love to your mom. And I give love to other women. Just like your mom gives love to other men.""

""...And women."" Mom added. 

""Oh right, heh, and women.""

I just looked from one to the other in stunned silence. They looked like my parents, they sounded like them, but these people were not the same ones I have left behind three months before. At some point, my soccer mom and nerd dad turned into full blown, tree hugging, love sharing, fire dancing hippies. I was like aliens had inhabited my parents bodies and were doing odd, inaccurate impressions of them. 

""Do we have room for dessert?"" Mom asked looking from me to dad getting to her feet. 

I just shrugged, nodding my head disinterestedly, ""sure, I guess.""

""Mmm, yeah, sounds great my love."" Dad said, playfully kissing her hands as She went in. As she left my eyes flashed over her and I noticed the tattoo a peace sign on her left butt\-cheek of  which I'd etither never known about or was new.  I bit my lip, pressed my legs together and laid my head on the table, feeling I had to be going insane . ""C'mon Big Bill, help me bring the trash to the compost heap."" Dad said jovially, thumping me on the back.  It the sun was in the midst of going down and as we walked back from the compost, Mom was coming back out of the kitchen, her fair skin seeming to glow in the dark. She laid a plate on the table stacked high with fudgy squares of chocolate.

 ""Vegan brownies...with just a hint of magic."" She said, winking as she sat back down. I stopped in my tracks, watching as the two of them both picked up squares and started to dig in.

""You mean...pot brownies?"" I asked.

""Mmm hmm"" Dad said. ""We have frozen yogurt too if you prefer not to have any..."" He said, munching down on the chocolate.

I looked from one to the other, torn. The situation was weird. Really, really weird. But I was a marijuana enthusiast with the best of them. And the chance to try it with my parents was one that sounded, under different circumstances, like some actual fun. ""You...you guys don't mind?"" I ask reach out towards the plate. Mom shook her head and pushed it towards me. 

""'Course not, please, feel free honey.""

Sitting back down, I grabbed the a brownie, regarded it carefully for a moment. Then I took a bite. Over the course of the next hour I learnt several things. First and foremost, vegan brownies, do kinda suck at first, but get better as you go along. Secondly, white, middle age people with money can get insanely strong weed. Third, I learnt that one such brownie is more than likely enough for the uninitiated. Finally, I learnt that being stoned with your nudist, hippie parents, whilst making thing seemingly mellower, also makes things... weirder.

Once the mosquitoes started dot get thicker we wondered back inside, my parents, clearly leading the way. Whatever preconceived notions of their ability to maintain themselves were smashed. I was in a genuine haze while, they just seemed enhanced somehow. The lightness and chilled out joviality they'd displayed since I got home was amp'd up to 11 now. Amazingly, I was actually starting to forget to care about their nakedness. It wasn't as though I forgot that they were naked, it just didn't seem to matter quite as much. As we stepped back into the kitchen., I heard myself asking. ""So, this, this whole, you know, like, thing...with the free loving and the nudity...it makes you happy right?""

""Happier than we have ever been Billy!"" Mom called from the living room. 

I looked at dad and nodded, finishing off my third brownie. as I watched him starting to do the dishes. ""Son, it's truly miraculous, the freedom we feel.""

I  licked my fingers, lost in thought. One in particular, was the phrase, repeating over and over again 'when in rome...'. I started to laugh. And laugh and laugh and laugh. Dad look up at me, smiling but a little alarmed. ""Hey now, you ok there Bill?""

""You know what? You know what? fuck it! I'll give it a try!"" I exclaimed, and kept laughing as I started to pull my shirt up off my body.

294,"""Helloooo!"" I called as I walked in. It took a beat before my brain caught up with my eyes and in that time everything look exactly as it had when I left. Then I blink and I re\-entered the real world. I was immediately hit by the powerful sent of incense. Beneath the incense was another smell, both sweet and pungent that I, as a college student, immediately recognized. A sort of chirpy flute music floated in the air gently. Looking towards the living room, the flat screen TV was gone, and in it's place stood a long Japanese rock garden, with a white porcelain statue of Buddha behind it. I had time to feel a sense of confusion and mutter ""Huh?"" When I heard a voice coming form the top of the stairs.

""Ooooh! Hiya Billy! C'mere! I've missed you!"" Looking up I was met by the sight of my mother. Her arms were open, her long, coppery curls fell over her shoulders. She had on a long, beaded turquoise necklace that jangled on her chest as she descended the stairs, a silver anklet of bells, and not a stitch more. With her arms up I could see a patch of fiery hair in her pit, and a matching triangle of fuzz between her legs. My mind went blank. I was aware that my mouth was very dry and hanging open and my eyes must have been quite wide. My stomach rolled and fluttered in embarrassment, but I was also struck by a surprising ache, lower down. I blinked and quickly looked away. ""Mom?! What the\-?!"" But the question dies in my mouth as I head the sound of the sliding patio door opening and closing from the kitchen.

My Father came around the corner, a huge smile his face. His formally neatly combed brown hair was now a shaggy mop top, and his face was a scruffy, Brillo\-pad of stubble. The only clothes he has on were his wire rimmed spectacles. ""There's my big guy!"" He said jovially, walking towards me at a distressing rate. My eyes fixated on the flaccid, dangling member, flopping back and forth between his legs, in of nest of coarse, dark pubes. My stomach rolled again, harder than before and I felt my eyes strain to look into the back of my skull. I moved to turn around but before I could My mom's hands were on my shoulder, pulling me into a hug. ""Mmm! It's so good to see you!"" She said as she pressed her bare body into mine. I leaned back, throwing my hands to the side as she ran her hand up and down my back and kissed my head ""MMWAH! How was your flight honey?"" She asked taking a step back. Dad came towards me now but I moved too fast this time. I took two rapid steps back and throwing my hands out in front of me, palms out.

""Dad?!"" I yelled in shock. ""What the hell?!"" My parents shared a puzzled, almost hurt expression as I turned around and closed my eyes.

""What do you mean son?"" Dad asked behind me.

I let out a very long, whining breath. ""You are...with the br\-...and the pe...WHERE ARE YOUR CLOTHES?!"" I finally exploded. For moment I stood silently with my back to them, eyes closed, the only sound the chirp of the flute music. Then the silence was replaced by sound of them bursting out in gales of laughter. This was not what I expected. It was enough of a surprise that I slowly turned back towards them, keeping my hands squarely over my eyes of course. ""What? what's funny? What's going on?"" I asked.

""Honey, please, we thought there was something really wrong."" My mother said when she had finished laughing.

""What do you mean?"" I demanded, ""You're naked!""

""That's right son, we are."" My father said happily. ""That's nothing 'wrong.' I'm sorry we surprised you, I guess we've gotten so used to it, it didn't even worth mentioning.""

""Wh\-what do you mean? what didn't seem worth mentioning?""

""Your mother and I have become naturists Bill."" He said calmly.

I shrugged, shaking my head, ""Natuwhat?"" I asked, the word meaning nothing to me. I still was covering my eyes, just guessing that I was facing them.

""Most people call it nudist dear."" Mom said sweetly. ""But that makes it seem so...silly. We prefer Naturist, since it's not about being naked, it's about being freer and closer to nature.""

""Well it sure looks like it's about being naked!"" I exclaimed, making them both laugh again. ""When did it start? How did it happen? Do you guys go out in public like this? What am I supposed to do about it?"" I asked rapidly.

""Now calm down Big Bill."" Dad said evenly, and I felt a hand on my shoulder. ""We'll answer all those questions in due time. But first and foremost let's get you settled in.""

""And sweety, I know it's a surprise, but try to open your eyes."" Mom said. ""You'll have to eventually. You can't keep your eyes closed the entire time your here.""

""Watch me try!""

""Oh honey, please? C'mon, it's still just Mom and Dad...""

I sighed as I realized she was right, more on a practical level then anything else. It really wasn't as though I could avoid it the entire time I was here. I let my hand fall back to the bag beside me then slowly opened my eyes. They were standing right in front of me smiling patently and expectantly. I felt my cheeks getting hot, trying to to look beyond their faces, finding my eyes wanting to be drawn down. I swallowed hard, and forced a shy smile ""Sorry I...freaked out....It was just a..shock.""

They both nodded. ""We should have told you, like I said, it's just been such a normal thing for us..."" Dad said and shrugged.

I nodded back and looked towards the living room. ""What happened to the TV?""

They both frowned in dismay and shook their heads. ""Oh we got rid of it honey.""

""Just a waste of space. keeping us mollified and stupified, filling up the space around it with violence and hate...ick! That zen garden has been there a little over a month it's worth more than a lifetime of TV.""

""We haven't gotten rid of yours sweety don't worry"" Mom added quickly, seeing the upset look on my face. ""We haven't touched anything in your room. Why don't you take your bag up there, get changed and refreshed, and then we can talk about things over some dinner...how's a veggie burger sound?""

""Get changed...you mean like...?""

""Only if you're comfortable with it son"" Dad said not unkindly. ""No one expects you to do anything that makes you uncomfortable.""

I started to walk past them when mom took my hand and I looked at her again, getting a really good look for the first time. Her hair stood out brilliantly against her pale white skin, her nipples were perfectly pink nubs on her amble breasts. I was shocked to feel the ache return in my groin, stronger this time. as she pulled me in to her hug once more. ""Mmm I've missed you honey, It really is great to see you Billy! I love you!"" As she did my nose filled with the familiar scent of her organic, herbal shampoo, while at the same time feeling the press of her breasts on my chest. My stomach fluttered and I grunted a little as my brain overloaded with simultaneous arousal and nostalgia.

I gave her a tentative pat on the back. ""I love you too mom."" I said.

\(To be continued\)",2018-05-25 03:50:16
295,"Miraculously, my room was untouched like Mom had said. After I set my bag down and removed my shoes and socks I laid on the bed with my arm over my eyes for a few minutes, simply breathing in and out while\> I wanted to try and make this make sense. My parents were naked. My parents had given up TV. My parents were, unless my senses failed me, smoking weed.  Oh right and they were naked. All that enough, without that weird....whatever it was that past over me when I looked at mom. I made a conscience decision to ignore and forget whatever that was. I had enough to process and I was suddenly very tired and hungry.

As I laid there, thinking about some things and not thinking about others, I realized the flute music had stopped and now, faintly outside I could hear what sounded like drums being played and light, melodic chanting. I sighed and moved my hand slowly. What in the hell was this now? Not really wanting to I forced myslef up and out of the room. I went out to the top of the stairs. ""Hello?"" I called down. I took a few steps down, worried about what I'd see when I walked around the corner. ""Hellooo?"" I asked again, as I reached the bottom. No one answered, but the sounds got louder. Rounding the corner, I went past the dining room and living room, spotting new pottery and painting on the walls as I did until I reached the kitchen and looked out the clear sliding door to the patio and backyard. I stared  for a few seconds, taking in the scene silently before muttering ""Oh my goooood...."" to myself.

The picnic table on the patio was set for three. The fire pit was lit up, a grill placed over it, covered in roasting corn and burger patties. Dad was sitting on the grass beside the fire, cross legged, still naked, with a large tight drum between his legs. He was beating the drum rapidly in a loose rhythm, while he chanted a low string of what sounded like gibberish. ""Umbumbowa...Mella tikka... om...mella tikka....Umbumbowa..."" Mom meanwhile was also there. She was also naked of course, standing by the edge of the fire pit her hands up over her head, twisting and turning them, her hips swaying back and forth as her feet moved slowly in a circle. HEr eyes were closed and she was smiling to herself as she muttered her own nonsense. ""Mumbewah....umbewhba....mmbobya...""

Shaking my head in disbelief I opened the door and stepped out. Looking directly at them was still a challenge. I managed to point my head in their generally direction without focusing on their bodies. I cleared my thoat. ""Ahem, hey..""

They both stopped and looked over. ""Oh hey son, you're right on time!"" Dad said, standing up.

""Mmm your father started the fire and it just suddenly felt like a moment for dancing!"" Mom said walking over and wiping sweat off her forehead, her cheeks flushed from the heat. She took Dad's hand as they walked back to the patio.

""Sooo...you guys dance...naked...to drums...around fires...outside."" I said flatly, still only half looking at them.

Dad Chuckled, ""Yep...I guess we should start explaining some things, have a seat Bill."" Dad said and gestured towards the picnic table. I just signed and nodded resignedly as I sat down.

Then, over the course of a few veggie burgers on whole\-wheat buns, roasted corn and quinoa, mom and dad explained what they'd been up to over the past few months. Evidently mom had started taking a new Hot Yoga class. It was in this class that she met her new friend ""Willow"". They talked at the class everyday, about kids, work vegetarianism, books, really hitting it off. Eventually, Willow invited mom and dad over for a party. It was then that the Nudism came up.

""We were pretty taken back at first as well at first"" Dad said, between sips of beer.

""Oh yeah, in hindsight we were so uptight and puritanical about it. Seeing all that skin on display when we walked in the first time, it was quite a shock to our delicate sensibilities."" Mom added, shaking her head and laughing at her foolishness.

""But they were all so friendly and accepting. Once we stopped judging with our eyes instead of our ears and we really began to listen to them. It all really made sense.""

Enough sense apparently that mom and dad eventually started joining in, and going to more functions, meeting new people. It wasn't long before it was an all the time thing when they were at home or over friends. They donated most of their clothes to a charity, keeping just the bare essentials each for when they had to go to town.  Since both of them pretty much workAnd it wasn't just the nudity.  They started smoking pot for the first time in years. They switched to all organic, cruelty free foods. They cut out TV, and switched to all natural products around the house. They went to drum circles and jam sessions. and what my dad cryptically called ""love ins"".

""We started to learn a lot"" Dad said. ""About the food we've been eating, the media we've consumed, about love and friendship."" He said, gently resting his hand over Mom's and smiling. Mom giggled and smiled back at him coquettishly.  Something about that exchange made my stomach flutter again.

""Wait a second..."" I said pushing back my plate. ""Are you talking about...like, swinging?!""

""Oh no, no no!"" Dad said shaking his head firmly.

""No, we would never do that. Not Swinging dear, free love."" Mom corrected and ran her arm over Dad's arm. Dad nodded.

""Right, Swinging is just about sex. What we do is about love.""

I shook my head. ""So you mean you...and you...with other people?! How could you?!""

Mom and dad look at each other and shrugged. ""Once you get over the petty restraints of Victorian western morality son it's not too hard. I realized that I don't own your mother. I don't own her love or her sexuality.""

""But...you're married..."" I said aghast.

""And we still love each other, very much, nothing about that has changed dear."" Mom said patiently. ""It's just that out eyes were opened. Marrying a person doesn't change who you are in the world. I am still a woman. Your father is still a man. We have love we want to give out to the world.""

""That's right. I give my love to your mom. And I give love to other women. Just like your mom gives love to other men.""

""...And women."" Mom added.

""Oh right, heh, and women.""

I just looked from one to the other in stunned silence. They looked like my parents, they sounded like them, but these people were not the same ones I have left behind three months before. At some point, my soccer mom and nerd dad turned into full blown, tree hugging, love sharing, fire dancing hippies. I was like aliens had inhabited my parents bodies and were doing odd, inaccurate impressions of them.

""Do we have room for dessert?"" Mom asked looking from me to dad getting to her feet.

I just shrugged, nodding my head disinterestedly, ""sure, I guess.""

""Mmm, yeah, sounds great my love."" Dad said, playfully kissing her hands as She went in. As she left my eyes flashed over her and I noticed the tattoo a peace sign on her left butt\-cheek of  which I'd etither never known about or was new.  I bit my lip, pressed my legs together and laid my head on the table, feeling I had to be going insane . ""C'mon Big Bill, help me bring the trash to the compost heap."" Dad said jovially, thumping me on the back.  It the sun was in the midst of going down and as we walked back from the compost, Mom was coming back out of the kitchen, her fair skin seeming to glow in the dark. She laid a plate on the table stacked high with fudgy squares of chocolate.

""Vegan brownies...with just a hint of magic."" She said, winking as she sat back down. I stopped in my tracks, watching as the two of them both picked up squares and started to dig in.

""You mean...pot brownies?"" I asked.

""Mmm hmm"" Dad said. ""We have frozen yogurt too if you prefer not to have any..."" He said, munching down on the chocolate.

I looked from one to the other, torn. The situation was weird. Really, really weird. But I was a marijuana enthusiast with the best of them. And the chance to try it with my parents was one that sounded, under different circumstances, like some actual fun. ""You...you guys don't mind?"" I ask reach out towards the plate. Mom shook her head and pushed it towards me.

""'Course not, please, feel free honey.""

Sitting back down, I grabbed the a brownie, regarded it carefully for a moment. Then I took a bite. Over the course of the next hour I learnt several things. First and foremost, vegan brownies, do kinda suck at first, but get better as you go along. Secondly, white, middle age people with money can get insanely strong weed. Third, I learnt that one such brownie is more than likely enough for the uninitiated. Finally, I learnt that being stoned with your nudist, hippie parents, whilst making thing seemingly mellower, also makes things... weirder.

Once the mosquitoes started dot get thicker we wondered back inside, my parents, clearly leading the way. Whatever preconceived notions of their ability to maintain themselves were smashed. I was in a genuine haze while, they just seemed enhanced somehow. The lightness and chilled out joviality they'd displayed since I got home was amp'd up to 11 now. Amazingly, I was actually starting to forget to care about their nakedness. It wasn't as though I forgot that they were naked, it just didn't seem to matter quite as much.

I looked at dad and nodded, finishing off my third brownie. as I watched him starting to do the dishes. ""Son, it's truly miraculous, the freedom we feel.""

I  licked my fingers, lost in thought. One in particular, was the phrase, repeating over and over again 'when in rome...'. I started to laugh. And laugh and laugh and laugh. Dad look up at me, smiling but a little alarmed. ""Hey now, you ok there Bill?""

Weirdly enough, this doesn't seem to be as much of a problem in TV animation, ESPECIALLY in childrens' animation.  (Weird, huh?)  A talented VA can put in a variety of voices and convincingly talk to themselves.  Some can even *sing* in different voices.

Three examples, all from the same show:  Tabitha St. Germaine, Ashleigh Ball, and Andrea Libman, on *My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic*.

While they each voice main charactersSt. Germaine voices Rarity (a posh Mid-Atlantic accent prone to exaggerated high-pitched freakouts), Ball voices Rainbow Dash (a raspy, ""cool"" voice) and Applejack (a country-fried twang), and Libman voices Fluttershy (soft-spoken, reserved, and shy) and Pinkie Pie (loud, excitable, and outgoing)each will often lend their voice to background characters where need be.

What's more impressive is an episode where, long story short, Rarity ends up imitating Applejack's accent, and Applejack ends up imitating Rarity, but it's not just the VAs putting in the respective accents, noyou could still tell who was speaking even with the visuals turned off.

A better example is a famous scene from Looney Tunes, wherein Bugs and Daffy each talk like the other...*but they're voiced by Mel Blanc*.  And you can STILL tell who's talking without visuals!",2018-05-25 05:19:43

http://www.abc.net.au/religion/articles/2017/04/11/4651763.htm

""Fake SheikH""

>Tawhidi is not recognised as an Imam or Sheikh by either the Australian National Imams Council or its South Australian equivalent, nor is he affiliated with any Australian mosque or prayer centre. The only religious instruction he offers is a self-described ""university standard"" Islamic Studies class delivered from a rented classroom at the University of South Australia. Course content posted online includes rambling refutations of the Big Bang and the theory of human evolution. A video he has shared on social media depicting a sparrow repeatedly fluttering against another sparrow gives a taste of his views on the latter.

One of those professors is even a top of his field aerodynamicist. In fact, my Structural Dynamics professor is the only professor I had who has correctly taught the cause as aerodynamic flutter. That's his field of expertise, so it makes sense for him to have gotten that right.

Just a few things I feel may have been better:
Still smile and flutter as though your endeavor didn't decline?--- the alliteration here sounds a bit off to me.  
State of your essence---- I think the state here is not required to get the punch in. 'even when your essence is...' may work to improve the readability of the poem. 

Or will you self-mend and purify? ---- While self-mend is correct, I think mend your self carries a greater sense of purpose and conviction behind it.  'Because you're still alive but the clock is ticking,' --- Since the very next line deals with life, perhaps you could simply say 'Because your clock is still ticking', In general, the clock ticking is a powerful cliche. I love cliches but part of being a good poet is to seek the new and original.

No, I actually am on the other end where I didn't realize that wasn't what was going on.

 I did end up finding this though thanks to the name aerostatic flutter that helps describe why they aren't the same

>Resonance is when the periodic response of a system to a periodic force is much stronger than usual near one or more particular frequencies. Aeroelastic flutter is not specifically a resonance because the input is not a periodic force, rather the input is uniform relative velocity of air and some object.

314,"Forgive me as I try and unpack my thoughts on why this stuff happens as a hetero cis liberal trying to be open minded regular whatever dude. This is a follow me along askng general questions thing not in anyway an attempt to justify Morgan Freeman's actions. 

Obviously, behaving like that is not okay because the women feel uncomfortable. Being that forward and direct is threatening.

Whenever someone imposes their will on your freedom or agency as a human being it's unacceptable and assault. Unfortunately, that assault sexual or otherwise happens in some form nearly daily to everyone. I'm sure at a more onerous level for women.  It's something we all have to deal with because people we are all selfish assholes.  There needs to be some line between annoying and criminal or life ending. 

But this specific behavior, commenting on someone's body or trying to lift a skirt, more so thought behind it, is not particularly or inherently abnormal. It's first biological and second societal. Men are more sexually aggressive by nature. Our society clearly perpetuates this type of behavior from men. The order is a moot point. The problem really is an issue of power imbalance. Not so much the act itself, which is in a vacuum is at worst a mild irritation. How does this play into normal everyday life?

My internal dialogue when I see an attractive woman starts out how I assume men of power think then say; pure caveman. ""That's a luscious ass, or what a marvelous set of tits you have"" It rapidly ascends, within seconds, to fantasies of nondescript sexual acts mixed with flutters of being madly in love thinking of marriage and a house and kids, then back to fucking her in a way I know don't have the prowess to pull off given the opportunity.  This happens pretty much daily, and I'm happily married with an awesome kid I love very much.  This has been the same with varying levels of creativity since I was like 14. Unless, I'm a sicko and don't know, this is how most men are. Most men, unless given some extra edge either it's wealth and power or excessive confidence don't act or speak on this internal dialogue. 

However,  I was told consistently and constantly from girl friends and other guys my age that women wanted men who were confident and took what they wanted. In every sex study on what women desire and fantasize about sexually, being dominated, taken forcibly or ""used as a sexual object""( from my wife) are near the top of the list. 

As someone lacking in self confidence this was a cause of confusion and anxiety. A lot more men than women probably think, just want to please the woman, but just don't fucking get it.  Am I supposed to ask every step? Am I just supposed to kiss you, grab you, fuck you? Or am I supposed to be nice and chivalrous? Or both, or read your mind? 

Given the current climate this is very confusing particularly to young men. I'm glad I'm married and not in college now. 

My questions are to any women still reading. Do you have the same type of internal dialogue about attractive men? If the fantasies about domination etc are true for you how are men supposed to navigate that? What is the difference between being creepy and hitting on you?  
How much does that depend on your attraction to who's saying it? Can men say anything about your body? Do women like that on any level? What's the difference between sexual harassment and being generally misguided? Is sexual harassment obviously different than a awkward dork trying to hit on you? When or how does playful sexual banter become harassment? Again is this obvious or are lines crossed that are more subtle that lead to something worse? 

I think a lot of young men want to take a shot at someone they like but are afraid it will be misconstrued or hurtful out of paranoia. A lot of us aren't very good at this and need help. 

Most of these questions don't matter to me personally any more, I'm good,  but I think we end up with ""incels"" because normal people are afraid to ask then become corrupted by their made up answers to these questions.

    brushed her fingers, one by one. He ran a hand gently down her leg. He stroked her face, 
    tracing the curve of her ears, running a finger gently around her mouth. He put both 
    hands in her hair and combed it with his fingers. He turned her around, massaged her 
    shoulders, slid a knuckle down the path of her spine.
    It seemed as if hours passed before his hands finally went to her breasts. He stroked the 
    soft skin underneath until it tingled. He circled her nipples with his thumbs, pinched 
    them between thumb and forefinger, then began to pull at her, very lightly at first, then 
    more insistently, until her nipples stiffened and began to ache.
    He stopped then, and drew her down onto his lap. Dany was flushed and breathless, her 
    heart fluttering in her chest. He cupped her face in his huge hands and looked into his 
    eyes. No? he said, and she knew it was a question.

I am really getting into Flutter and Fuchsia.  I am not aware of any other big tech building a new OS built from the ground up including the kernel for security.

The way that Google implemented GNU/Linux on ChromeOS is a far more innovative approach than how MS did it.   Google has the GNU/Linux application separated using containers and then the entire thing sand boxed.

""Damn,"" he muttered as he dragged himself to the side of the pier, wondering what kind night he had had. He checked his reflection in the water.

A ring of clotted blood dotted the left side of his neck. They looked almost like teeth marks from a large piranha.

That's right. He'd been down at the pier alone at night after a long Saturday of fishing. His brother from out of town had left at sunset to go home and get ready for work the next week. A few beers were had when a patch of water began glowing a faint phosphorescent green - one that grew brighter and brighter until eventually, it outshone the electric lantern by his side. 

He'd been thinking that he had drunk too much when the shining water coalesced into a woman's head, peeking out from above the gentle waves. Her long, wavy hair glowed emerald. Her eyes were white like the moon.

He was sure he was drunk. So he poured the remaining beer right on her head.

All he remembered after that was the woman growing larger, drawing closer, and thinking she was as beautiful as she was furious.

His legs itched terribly. He looked down.

Underneath his skin grew scales.

Smothering a scream, he tore at them. His skin stretched, broke, and bled. The scales poked out, an iridescent green.

356,"In NY I had people involved in my medical care. While in a clinic there was a high pitched tone played which I gave no reaction to. My hearing these organ like tones, pulsating or holding one tone down, is increasing at different locations. So I can't go into the Dollar General without hearing them. I also heard them at a banquet facility up in Bear Mountain where someone contacted me, wanting to know if I recognized them. 
I don't know how to describe it all but from what I experienced yesterday, this has to be some  experiment with controlling someone. So imagine letting someone know they are being tracked by sound. I have also recently experienced odd fluttering sort of sensation with some of the sounds. I don't have an answer, I am certain someone out there is well aware of this. I imagine the point to is to create a situation where I make everyone at home crazy by stating I hear this. I won't do that. Why am I hearing it in my  bedroom at night? How would they make a target homeless and jobless? I don't think this is unprovable, they just got this far because we need to catch up with technology. It all sounds like science fiction because we don't know everything that is being developed. 
As far as neuro-monitoring, there are things I think can be done with limitations. Sort of like they can do a few things than make them seem more advanced through harassment. I think the aim of some of these people is to see if they can induce a sort of false reality through multiple tactics. I don't want to throw myself into deep water without being able to swim. I have things I could discuss but it has to be done clearly. Not where someone trolls about some bs satan thing.

This weepy veil of tears,
Grandmother offered counseling,
Ive kept for all these years.

She meant to keep her happiness
And brightness in the world,
And so she said to me that day:
Listen carefly girl,

When dreamy vessels float to you,
And cling to only sky,
And bring you colors in the air,
Dont let it pass you by.

Greet them all and dont forget
As they go flutter by,
Appreciate their loveliness,

Also, pay attention to the color of the butterflies like white, yellow or monarchs. Notice if they are dancing around you and fluttering all happy.

I still cry as soon as the song starts with the opening notes of the piano. Its unreasonable to feel this sad considering TVXQ was a duo by the time I got into KPop and OT5 was a thing of history.

374,"Malmed crouched beside Hroshidur and Alcinon upon the roof of the abandoned hab, staring down upon the milling herd of apes. His three eyes were unblinking, swiveling independently in the curl of his central horns, scrutinizing the make of every soul residing in the glorified hovel. His attention was not lost on each of the prey. They saw his eyes in the recesses of their minds. They understood intimately in a way primordial instinct registered, that the dread did not stem from their own extinguishment, but the *things* those baleful eyes promised. What it saw in their futures, in the glow of their unmaking, reshaping, and ultimately - torment. 

 In there the High Acolyte hissed, teeth grit. Surveying the Sons of Horus and the actions theyd taken in robbing he and his brothers of what this world had owed his brothers and sisters flooded his veins with frigid spite. 

*+We have a bead on them.+* Jaik pulsed. The High Acolytes brothers and sisters had scattered themselves through the windows, aiming their overcharged hellguns for the Astartes surrounding the enormous terminator. Such weapons would be of no use on the giant, not in the ways the Coil brothers could be. 

Those acolytes that had been reclaimed after being left to stand vigil on this world so long ago had reclaimed their store of garb and weaponry. Having stashed their holy weapons and raiments away to take the guise of gangers, returning on this day saw them dressed in old suits of crimson carapace, their helms the effigies of bestial nightmares. 

In clawed gauntlets they held their own rifles, older variants of the sleeker hellguns used by High Acolyte and his retinue, three of which had been over-modified as more potent long-las variants.  

Two of the eight Reclaimed hefted weighty *tread-fether* launchers from two parallel alleyways, the dusty tubes of the launchers scarred by runes, the metal warped by nefarious oddities inherent in the tainted metal. 

All were poised to open fire, the High Acolyte had only to give the word. 

_+We are abstaining from violence+_ he pulsed assertively to the rest who hid in the empty dwelling. Only the Reclaimed met his thought with some resistance. Stranded on a planet for decades, awaiting the coming of the marked one, only to see their time squandered by the strange heroics of rival Legion 

There would be blood for this if an intervention was not made. Malmed made it clear this was understood; he made it clear he was in agreement. He did so with the faintest brush of his hungry intellect against the meat of the High Acolytes mind. Doing so filled the mans empty eyes with bloody tears. 

***+Speak, so we may listen. Then, we act.+***

By your Word, brother the High Acolyte groaned. Robes fluttering in the wind, he walked past the watching Coil beasts, away from the pain of Malmeds presence, and calmly stepped off the roof of the building. Lorhal landed beside him just as lightly as he, intent to guard him as he walked directly towards the Legion warriors. 

*+A name, my brothers. I sense your recognition, does he have a name?+*

Hroshidurs psychic growl nearly upended him then and there.

***+Rellian. Pact Breaker.+***

Moments later there came a terrific clamor, the torturous scouring of metal on stone. Hroshidur and Alcinon dropped down beside Lorhal and the High Acolyte in booming thuds then a rain of clawed stone. The Coil Brothers shook their manes, warbling gutturally to each other, for all the world sounding like squabbling lions. 

So it was two mortal acolytes who approached Xarik and his forces, loping beside them two guardians dredged from Hell. Behind them through empty windows and doorways a multitude of hellish lenses glowed. It made for quite a scene. Many of the hopeless mortals began to scream in their panic. To him it was music.

375,"1)  I actually *enjoy* diapering.  This is worth the work of doing cloth to me all on it's own.

It's a huge part of every day ( I have 2 in diapers right now) and wrapping them in cloth and seeing all those diapers fluttering on the clothes line, make me so happy, in a way I can't really explain.  I told someone once it was like eating a steak with a plastic knife and fork vs. real silverware.  Sometimes plastic is what you have or need and it's better than nothing,  but once I wrapped my baby up in cotton and wool it was really hard to wrap them in plastic and gel-foam.  It just seems...wrong...somehow?


2)  Money and convenience.  I have never run out of diapers since I got my stash set up well.  If I'm out of my preferred fitteds, I can switch to flats or prefolds til laundry is done.  

I have a really expensive stash (wool and fitteds, with lots of extra bumgenius and lil helpers), and I will need (want) a few more fitteds if my oldest doesn't potty train soon, but I'm still looking at less than 1500 for 3 years of diapers x two kids (at least, I have also loaned out my newborn stash to two different babies and we may have more in our family, yet)  and 80% of that (some was used when we got it, or got used in heavier rotation) will be in great shape to resell for at least a third of that money back.  


3)  My kids rarely display any redness or irritation in cloth, and it is always easily treated by one or two rounds of lotion or cream and some air time!  In disposables, they start looking red or bumpy after just a few hours.


4)  Less leaks and blowouts.  I feel like a third of the disposables I have ever used end up leaking, which really reduces the convenience of one time use diapers. (Especially when traveling!) If I have to wash poop off of everything anyway, why even bother with a trashable diaper?

5)  The smell of disposables is unbearable to me.  For whatever reason just a little pee smells like  a porta potty!",2018-05-28 19:30:55
376,"Deaths greatest mistake was letting Alice ask the first question.  Or maybe it was waking her up so should could answer the question.  Either way, Death never should have answered it.

Death quietly set the hourglass on the floor beside Alices big-girl bed, watching a few grains of sand trickle out.  She slept peacefully, her coughing momentarily subsided.  Only the moonlight reflected on her face betrayed the dark circles under the dark lashes resting on her cheek.  All Death had to do was touch that cheek and the job would be done.  One touch was all it took.

This was by no means Deaths first child, nor was she the prettiest, or most special, or in any way extraordinary.  But it had been a long few days, and no one could blame Death for a momentary hesitation.  Come to think of it, maybe that was Deaths greatest mistake.  Regardless, rather than just releasing her soul as was the job, Death slipped, jostling the bed.

Alices eyes fluttered open.

Deaths eyes widened in surprise, anticipating that she would scream.  But she didnt.  Instead, she simply asked, Why did you wake me up?  It caught Death completely off guard, which she simply should not have been able to do.

Uh, Death mumbled, thinking of an answer.  He thought for a moment and decided for a version of the truth.  Because you have to go with me.

Why?

Because its time to go.

Why?

Throughout the eons Death had learned (the hard way) that frightening the soon-to-be-deceased is a bad idea.  So Death thought fast.  Youve been really sick, right?  Im taking you where you wont be sick anymore.

To the hopspistal?  I dont want to go back to the hopspistal.

Death smiled, and shook its head.  No.  No more hopspistals for you.  Im afraid they werent helping much, anyway.

So where are we going?

Death glanced at the hourglass, noting that her time was running out.  Only a few more minutes.  Its hard to explain.

Can Mommy come?

No.  This is a trip just for you, Alice.

At that, Alice hugged a worn brown bear a little tighter.  But well miss each other.  We always miss each other when I has to be gone.

I know.  And I am truly sorry.  For both of you.  But thats how it has to be.

Why?  

Death stared at Alice, marveling at just how innocent she was.  There was no anger, no pleading, no grief in her manner at all.  Just a childs curiosity, only wanting the answers to her questions.  And in that second, Death decided to grant those answers.  Alice, your mommy cant go with you because you see, youre just too sick to live anymore.  Im sorry, but youre supposed to die tonight.  Do you know what that means?

Alice nodded solemnly.  Mr. Poppers died last year.  Alice stole a glance at a picture of a fat gray tabby on her bedside table.  He used to sleep in the bed with Mommy.  Now he sleeps in the ground.

Thats right.  Youre going to sleep like Mr. Poppers.

I *was* asleep, Alice reminded him.  *You* woke me up.

Im sorry.  I didnt mean to.  Death meant that.  This would have been so much easier had she just remained asleep.

Why do I have to die?  Alice asked.  I dont want to.

I know you dont.  But youre just too sick, and your body just cant keep going.

Why?

Because theres only so much human bodies can endure before they give out.

Why?

Well, thats how theyre made.

Why?

Death peeked at the hourglass.  The sand had run to the bottom, signaling that time had literally out.  He had to wrap this up and move on to the next person.  Because people dont live forever.  This was the core principle Deaths job was built on, and It knew it to be true.

Why not?

This, however, had never truly been answered to anyones satisfaction.  There were theories, of coursethe Earth couldnt sustain everyone whos ever lived, the circle of life, humans just werent designed that way, even a theory about renewable energy assetsbut none of them were truly satisfying.  Death quickly weighed the options and decided to go with the truth.  I dont really know.  Thats just the way it is.

Alice studied Death carefully and asked what would be her final question.  Why me?

She seemed so plaintive and small that a wave of sympathy washed over Death, who actually knew the answer to this one.  Well Alice, Death began, and with a crooked finger stroked her face.  Her face, which was already turning blue and cold.  Death realized a moment too late what It had done, and the answer to Alices question turned into a howl of frustration.  It wasnt her time!  We werent finished!

Alices funeral was a somber affair, as childrens funerals tend to be.  Alices mother didnt say much, only thanked people for attending.

381,"No. I think even an animal as ""heavy"" as a mouse could survive. 

Much more than you asked for:

Terminal velocity is the speed at which an object stops accelerating, because of wind resistance.

In a complete vacuum, something you drop off a cliff would reach a speed of 32 feet per second in the first second, 64 feet per second in the second second, 96 fps in the third, and so on.

But, wind resistance slows things down. When it slows the object so it is no longer accelerating due to gravity, the object has reached its terminal velocity. (The object is still hurtling down, it just isn't going faster every second.)  Wind resistance depends on density, weight and shape. It is higher for a feather than for a cannon ball. The more streamlined something is, the less wind resistance and thus higher terminal velocity. Also, for a given shape, the heavier it is the less WR and higher TV. 

Snipers use .50 caliber rounds for long-range shots because that size has less wind resistance than smaller ones. If you were to put a BB in a specially-made cartridge with as much gun powder as a .50, it would not go nearly as far, due to wind resistance.

Terminal velocity for an average 180-pound person is about 200 MPH, which means most people who jump off of high things die. It's a lot lower for smaller creatures. You could drop an ant from the Empire State building and it wouldn't care.

While I'm at it, there's a myth that of you drop a penny from a great height, and it hits someone, it will kill him. Nope. Even with a scotch tape ""tail"" so it won't flutter, a penny dropped off a 12-story building doesn't chip the sidewalk. A friend of mine made that experiment in college.",2018-05-28 20:59:50

The darkness of the swamp was never a problem and the shamans knew how to manipulate the death that permeated their daily life. That was until the ""Green Sickness"" arrived in the form of a great black cypress spire and undead alligators, boars, wolves, bears, and pumas started attacking the tribe. Under siege the tribe sent him and the shaman's only daughter to investigate the spire to look for answers. 

They snuck their way in and discovered it covered inside with a rare, glowing fungi. Being a new life form they reached out to it and pleaded with it to stop the attacks. It was revealed that while the being was ancient it had only awoken recently and was only in the infancy stage. It was scared and alone, looking for guidance. The two offered to merge with it to teach it the ways of this world and a bargain was struck.

The dark tower went dormant, the undead creatures returned to the lower levels, and the spores fluttered down to infuse themselves with their new hosts. The two were not understood when they returned home and were exiled. They each went their separate ways and vowed to return home one day after establishing spore towers far away from civilization where they could grow and be left alone in peace.

And yet here he was, fists curled up and keeping himself from shaking with rage.

""Yes, you must."" Rodwell responded, picking up a couple of the books that the lad had hurled his way. The spine on 'Brandon the Burner' was all broken, which annoyed him even further as he placed it on the bedside table. ""If you were one of my children, or maybe one of your siblings, then -""

""I don't have to marry. Not anyone. *You* can't make me."" The lad said with a blissful air of ignorance and apparent power.

The constant undermining of Rodwell's place had been grating on him, and he knew it would only get worse as Rickon grew older. Sooner or later, he'd start asking the question of *when* the regents would lose their power. He just stood and looked at the brat, trying to think of ways to rationalise it all to him. ""Any of your other council would say the same. You need an heir, and to have an heir you need a wife. It's the way it's been for thousands of years.""

""It doesn't have to be that way for me!"" Rickon snapped.

It was just too much. There was a wolf within Rodwell also, one that rarely needed to rear its head. ""Brandon the Builder. Built Winterfell. Built Storm's End. Built the damned *Wall*, Rickon. Even he found the time to have a wife, and have many sons.""

""Yes - but - "" Rickon began, only for Rodwell to silence him with a hand gesture.

""His grandson the breaker, spent his life allying with wild folk to repel the Night's King. *He* found time to find a wife and have sons. Rickard the Laughing Wolf, conquered all of The Neck and brought the crannogmen into our kingdom. *He* had sons and a wife. Theon Stark, who defeated the Andals.""

""Did he have a wife?""

""Of course he did. If he did not, then some other Stark would have taken over and become king. We are from a long line of great kings, all who bear the name Stark. All have ruled from Winterfell, and all have had wives and sons. It is your *duty* as Warden of The North to ensure the bloodline of our family.""

At *last*, the lad opposite him seemed defeated. He looked down at the bedsheets rather than at his cousin, who seemed genuinely angry for once. Rickon picked up one of his books and placed it on the bedside along the others, all the while not meeting Rodwell's eyes.

""I am Lord. I just want to do what I want."" He admitted quietly.

""We all do, lad."" The taller and older Stark answered, clapping a hand on Lord Rickon's shoulder. ""But we have to do our duty. I wanted to explore the Seven Kingdoms, you know. But it fell on me to help you here, and we are all better for it.""

""Who will it be?"" The youthful voice came, as he gathered some of his supplies for the day.

Rodwell had a reason to smile. ""Anyone you want, mate. you said it yourself - you're Warden of The North. Just like Lord Ryswell's done, many people will make offers. You'll have so many to choose from you won't know what to do. You're a powerful person, and people will want you on side.""

That seemed to tide him over for now, at least. Rickon was at the age where a slight thing could set him off, and a slight thing could ease him. Temperamental, even for one with the wolf's blood. It was all very normal for a young lord in his position, Rodwell just wished he could let somebody else deal with it - but they all feared the famous 'wrath of Rickon'. ""Now don't forget your boots. We are going riding with the Cassels today, out through Winterstown.""

And just like that, the books slammed to the ground again. ""I don't want to!""",2018-05-28 21:57:21
388,"My daughter Isabella rolls her clear-sky eyes when I tell her to mind the gators. The pit cost me a proper fortune--hand-dug by a pair of burly dwarves who seemed less than faithful to the notion of fair business practices towards the end--yet you'd never catch Izzy admiring. No *Gee dad! Look at those pearly whites!* No, *holy smokes, those make me feel safe at home*. No.  She and her new silk dress are just *twirl, swish, zoom* all the way up to her tower each and every time I mention her meds. 

""You *don't* need to remind me dad!"" her squeaky voice echoes down untold flights of stairs. ""I'm not a mutt on a leash!""

""Are you crying?"" I ask, de-activating the tripwires with muscle-memory as I climb the stone tower after her. ""What did I--?""

*Slam.* *Clink.* *Crick*.

I've got to hand it to her. She's got the goblin-forged door locks down pat. 

I'd been worried about making such an investment. But she's put them to good use, locking them right in my face. 

After our arguments, I sigh and pour handbrewed moonshine into a glass by the fireplace.  I collapse in my old rocker and drink beneath a waning lantern. The distillery is located on the ground floor. It's the one thing I've left untouched after all these years. The barrels still have that mossy film that Paw swore gave the 'shine some aftertaste, and the bottles I use are all recycled mats from the olden days, when Izzy was just a squalling babe. As strange as it is to say, sometimes I wager *those were the days*.

Those days, it seemed, a pretty penny was something to *save*.

Those days, I could keep adventurers away as easily as lifting a bale of hay. 

Those days, Izzy used to smile when I hummed her to sleep. 

Usually, after two or three glasses, I hear Izzy singing to the moon. Her songs are all laced with teardrops. I peek out discretely from the lower story windows, and each time I see why I have had such misfortune. The girl looks just like her mother--the very same ashberry hair and little porcelain lips.

She even has the same voice. 

It's no wonder adventurers from the four corners of the world have come to whisk her away. 

It's no wonder why she's grown to hate me. If she were more like *me*, perhaps I could bear to see her go. Perhaps I would stop adding to this abominable*fortress* and let her live her damned life. 

But she's gotten more of her mother than either of us could bargain for. And I cannot bear another bout of heartbreak. 

Most mornings, I bring her a platter of bacon. I unwind the spike-traps, and hop over all the false steps, bowing low before her reinforced door with our usual peace treaty. ""It's nature's miracle,"" I say with an apologetic smile. 

Most mornings, too, she apologizes in return. She chews on the bacon and shows me the pill minder--the days all writ in golden letters. ""Thank you,"" I say. ""You know...your mother neglected...""

""I know dad. I'm sorry,"" she says, throwing her arms around me. 

The universe remains balanced. 

Yet, today, everything is off kilter. It's as if Atlas has let us roll off his back. 

I use the platter to pry Izzy's door open. My feet slip on all the blasted bacon grease. 

""Izzy!"" I shout. ""Are you alright in there?""

No answer, save silence. 

I resort to using the acid from ground level moat. Eventually, the locks give. I suppose those goblins didn't think of everything. 

When I swing the door open, I fear the worst. 

An empty pill-minder, and even emptier eyes. 

But Izzy is just...gone. Absent among billowing curtains. 

My heart flutters as I stumble to her windowsill. 

It's early yet. 

The moon is still out. Caught in that strange tidepool of the inbetween. Not quite morning, not quite night. Just a clenched fist of confusion. I turn my bleary eyes towards it all and let *loose*. 

Someone has stolen my daughter. 

It's my turn to wail.

399,"Was this the end?


Kiran couldn't get the thought out of his head. They were a man down after losing Raven earlier at the hands of a mage. He was in no state to fight, so he had been safely sent back to the castle. However, with the tempest so powerful already there was no choice but to keep pushing ahead.


Here at the epicenter of the tempest, things had fallen apart. While battling Loki's forces, Delthea and Chrom had become separated by unexpected reinforcements, sending them charging off down a steep ravine. The pair could handle themselves but Lyn was forced to defend both herself and Kiran, who could do little but stay out of the way as much as he could.


They were sheltered for the moment behind a damaged wall, but they were pinned down by the archers and mages surrounding Loki up ahead. Lyn's horse pawed the ground nervously. She laid a soothing hand on its mane, but her pale complexion betrayed her own anxiety. ""I don't know how long I can hold them off. If I had Sol Katti...""


Kiran just shook his head, barely registering what she had said. He tried--no, he needed to think. There had to be a way out of this. Lyn was depending on him... they all were. But she couldn't take them all on herself, and if they retreated here Delthea and Chrom would get flanked and overrun. Nor could they hold this position with reinforcements coming through portals guarded by Loki.


Frustration and desperation swirled around in his head, ripping his concentration to shreds. No matter how he looked at it, they were trapped. There was nowhere to go.


""Lyn... I can't see it... I can't""


""Ah! Watch out!"" He heard Lyn call out moments too late. Magic smashed into the other side of the wall and completely blasted it apart. Debris showered down, knocking him to the ground.


A sharp pain flared in his right shoulder as a large piece of rock struck him, but it was nothing next to the unpleasant feeling of vulnerability that washed over Kiran as he realised he was exposed. He tried to move, to scramble to safety, but something pulled at his limbs, tying him to the ground. Loki's work, he realised, catching sight of the woman's devious smile and softly glowing staff.


Back against the wall. An archer stepped forward and pulled his bow taut. Kiran could do nothing but watch as the arrow was loosed, careening straight towards his chest.


In weakness, he shut his eyes for what was to come. A kingdom not saved. Alfonse, Sharena, Anna... would they be okay without their summoner?


... Which would hurt more, the pain of regret or the arrow piercing his body?


It was definitely the regret, he decided. Being shot didn't seem to hurt at all. The air in front of him shifted as it was displaced, but he only realised someone was standing in front of him when he heard them speak.


""You will not die here. I swear it. Are you hurt?""


That voice... he'd recognise it anywhere. He knew the broad back encased in cracked jet-black armour he saw when he opened his eyes. The gleaming silver sword, regal in bearing yet battered with age in equal parts. 


Zelgius.


Kiran felt a warmth as the spark of hope reignited in his chest. It was only recently that they had started to become closer, but in that moment he could think of no one else he'd rather have with him. Loki's magic wavered, and he found the strength to pull himself back to his feet. ""I'm fine,"" he replied, ""but how did you...""


""There is no time. That woman must be slain to cull the tempest's power, correct?""


""Yes, but you can't take them all on! There's too many of them...""


""Do recall what I told you, Kiran? The path to victory lies ahead, even if you cannot yet see it."" Zelgius didn't turn around, surveying the amassed forces with a careful eye. He raised his sword vertically, almost as if in prayer. ""I will show you the way.""


Steadily, menacingly, he began to walk towards the opposing army, his cape fluttering behind him. Armour of black, yet a light that pierced the darkness ahead.


With Alondite in hand, Zelgius seemed a hundred times more intimidating than when they would speak off the battlefield. Even as he acted in protection of Kiran, he could feel the fearsome presence that inspired terror in all but the strongest of heart.


The enemy felt it tooit was visible in their body language as they engaged him in combat. The first shot was an arrow that barely glanced off his armour, thrown off by shaking aimin return, Zelgius charged into the fray and rent the archer in two. In the face of such power, weapons fumbled from trembling hands and incantations died in the throats of their caster.


Perhaps that was why spell or sword alike seemed unable to touch him; he tore through soldiers left and right, devastating anything that came within reach of his blade. Anything that made it past him was simply absorbed by his black armour, cracked as it already was.


""He's right. You got us here, now leave it to us!"" Lyn smiled at him reassuringly, drawing an arrow from her quiver and nocking it. With an encouraging pat, her horse galloped out onto the battlefield once more. She found a target in seconds and loosed the arrow, sniping a cavalier clean out of his saddle.


Zelgius' warpath only intensified with Lyn providing covering fire. His tempo increased, pushing further and further into the enemy lines now he could leave stragglers for Lyn to pick off.


He was carving a path towards Loki. She knew it too, going by her dark expression, and she unleashed her magic on him just as he had wrenched Alondite out of the chest of his newest victim. Dark magic flashed around him but he darted out of the way, moving far faster than anyone wearing a full suit of armour had any right to. 


As Kiran watched, time seemed to slow down for a moment. It took a second for everyone to realise what was happeninglong enough for Zelgius to close the distance between them. He seized the opportunity that presented itself, throwing all of his might into a ferocious swing of his blade. Loki raised her weapon to block the blow


and with a mighty snap, the tall staff splintered completely in two.


She staggered back, but before she could recover a swirling torrent of magic barrelled into her at full forcethe signature mark of Dark Aura. Red energy crackled as it coursed through Loki's body, throwing her to the ground.


She convulsed for a moment, until Alondite was thrust into her chest.


Immediately, she shattered into a thousand pieces. A coalescence of magic contained inside Loki's body was extinguished, radiating out in a soft pulse before dissipating for good.


""It was just an illusion,"" Lyn murmured, pausing with an arrow in hand. ""Is the tempest lessening?""


""I don't know..."" Kiran looked up, craning his neck to look up at the sky. The dark clouds still swirled ominously, crackling and glowing with chaotic energy. Only time would truly tell, but it seemed to have stopped strengthening for now.


He was dragged back to reality when he was almost trampled by Lyn's horse jerking to the side, barely avoiding an arrow that whizzed past its ear. Lyn herself almost tumbled out of her saddle, but she managed to regain her footing and return fire.


Kiran frownedhe had hoped defeating Loki would shut off the portals, but soldiers continued to stream through unabated. Too much for even Zelgius to take on if they stuck around for much longer. He called out, ""Everyone! We're backing off!""


Lyn made a noise of acknowledgment. Zelgius said nothing in response, but for a brief moment their eyes metenough to convey his understanding. He began to run, firing the Breidablik above his head. Devoid of ammunition, a flare of white light burst from the barrel high into the air instead: the signal to retreat.",2018-05-28 23:56:02
400,"Scissor isn't flutter kick. Scissor has one leg consistently going forward while the other goes back- like a scissor. Flutter kick has both legs going up and down. Using flutter kick to tread uses a lot of energy. 

A frog kick- breaststroke kick or whip kick- has knees bend feet go out and whip around basically in a circle. 

I typically use a scissor kick and use my arms in a sculling motion, sometimes not even kicking just using arms. Watch videos of treading kicks: whip kick, egg beater, and scissor kick. Try them all out, you'll have your own preference and might think one is easier than the others. 

Treading water is hard, it will take time to build up the time you are able to tread for. My best advice is do strong bigger kicks vs really fast smaller kicks (like a flutter kick) because you'll be able to conserve some energy and tread longer. ",2018-05-28 23:57:48

402,"The Tempest: a whirling hurricane of chaos and destruction, devouring everything in its path.  Nobody is sure where it comes from or why it even exists.  All that is known that it will appear suddenly, ravaging the lands, at its center a powerful Hero.  Defeating the Hero causes the Tempest to temporarily abate, where it will appear in another place, at another time.  
  
This time, the Tempest appeared to be located off the coast of Mspell.  It howled over the fiery plains, crashing against the already-bleak landscape.  The countryside was empty of all civilian life, the residents having either fled out of the path of the storm or died to the wall of magic.  
  
A lone figure stood atop a cliff, azure cape fluttering in the gale.  The masked swordsman who called himself Marth was another constant to the Tempests presenceeverywhere the storm went Marth was sure to follow.   It is unknown what exactly Marths relation to the Tempest was, but it was certain his fate was intertwined with the magical anomalys.  
  
My oh my, purred Loki, overlooking the swordsman from her unseen vantage point.  How cool and mysterious that masked man is!  Quite a dashing figure, dont you think?  
  
We both know who that is, Loki, Laegjarn said shortly.  Quit the act.  
  
Oh?  Youre not interested?  Loki gasped in mock surprise.  And I was *so sure* youd find at least *some* connection with your fellow masked woman!  
  
The general stiffened slightly.  I havent the faintest what youre talking about.  
  
Dont be foolish, Darlene, Loki said dismissively.  I mean, really?  Rose Mask?  You always did like Camus, true, but that is too much, dont you think?  
  
Again, I dont know what youre going off on.  Laegjarns eyes narrowed.  If youre just going to waste my time with trivial banter Im going to leave.  I have more pressing matters to attend to.  
  
Oh, dont mind me, the strategist said.  I find your little games quite amusing, truth be told.  Its certainly more fun than Sutrs boring conquest.  
  
Laegjarn said nothing, crossing her arms.  Loki sighed.  Come now, dear.  Dont be so mad!  Youll ruin your pretty face with wrinkles!  
  
Laegjarns response was cut by the sight of four Heroes appearing behind Marth in a flash of light.  She recognized them to be Innes, Ninian, the actual Marth, and Ishtar.  They spoke a few short words before Marththe masked one, that isswung her sword, creating a scar of light in the Tempests howling wall of wind.  She and the others disappeared into the storm, the gate closing behind them.   
  
Ah, so the time has come, Loki said, smiling slightly.  Laegjarn found the sight to be unnerving and unnatural.  My dear Laegjarn.  Im afraid our time here is at an end.  Be a dear and tell that Kiran boy I say hello, okay?  Or was Lee his name?  
  
I dont understand, Laegjarn replied once more, truthfully this time.  
  
You will soon enough, Loki said airily.  For now, so long!  I have some adorable brides to meet and the heart of chaos to return to!  Ta-ta!  With those final words, the tactician vanished in a flash of magic, leaving Laegjarn alone with the wind.  
  
The general grit her teeth.  This is bad, she muttered to herself.  Whistling, she ran and leapt off the precipice she had been standing on, falling through the air before landing on her beloved wyverns back.  She withdrew her mask from her saddle pouch and affixed it over her face, grimacing.   *I need to warn them,* she thought to herself.  *Lokis planning something, and its not good.*  
  
Far above the cliffs of Mspell, above the howling winds of the Tempest, Loki watched the princess fly away, indeed towards the direction of the Askran camp.  Youre so obvious, my dear, she tittered, putting her hand to her lips.  But thats what makes you such a fun piece on the board.  You and all those so-called Heroes.  She cast her gaze toward the Tempest, her smile widening.  Now, time for some fun.
  
---  
  
The Falchion flashed through the air, cutting a red line through the chest of the enemy spearman.  With a single gurgle, he fell to his knees, his life bleeding out onto the cold snow.  Marth checked around him once more, scanning the frosty forest for further foes.  Sensing nobody, he sheathed the Falcion.  Its all clear on my end.  Are you all okay? he called out to his companions.  
  
I am fine, Prince Marth, Ninian said, the ground trembling as the ice dragon took a few steps towards him.  In a flash of blue light, her draconic form disappeared, replaced by that of a young woman in a blue dress.  Prince Innes, Lady Ishtar, are you safe?  
  
All good on our end, Innes said, plucking an arrow out of a fallen body.  He and Ishtar put away their weapons, ready to advance to the next area.  The Masked Marth (whom everyone knew as Lucina but called her Marth out of consideration) sheathed her own Falchion, walking up to join the group.  
So wheres the way forward? Innes said.  Weve cleared the area of enemies.  
  
Indeed.  It should appear . . . Masked Marth cast her gaze about, noticing a runic portal that had sprung to life amongst the snow.  There.  Follow me.  
  
The group followed her, Marth bringing up the rear.  As they stepped into the glyphs center, they vanished in a flash of light, reappearing in a different snow-laden localewith new enemies waiting for them.   
  
The Tempest had the ability to assimilate parts of the lands it had once raged over.  Currently, Marth realized, they explored the wintry cliffs of Nifl, the biting wind howling through the trees.  According to Masked Marth, each are of the Tempest had a certain number of foes occupying the pocket space created by the gale.  Defeating those foes would then open the pathway to the next area, then the next, and then the next, until finally they would arrive at the Tempests heart.  All they needed to do then was take down the Anchorthat is, the Hero the Tempest latched onto to sustain itself for the time of its existence.  Upon their defeat, the Tempest would abate, leaving for a time until its eventual reawakening.  
  
How many? asked Marth, unsheathing his sword.  
  
About ten, Innes said, peering down the cliffside.  We can take them easily.  
  
Right then, Masked Marth said.  Lets move!  
  
With a cry, the warriors left off of the icy bluff, crashing into their enemies below.

It was rare to see Anna get this fired up over something not money, Kiran noticed.  
  

He had no sooner sent a regiment to go with Lucina*Masked Marth,* Kiran though with some amusementthan Sharena had burst into the room, announcing the presence of a new festival.  Anna claimed to only be interested in the monetary aspect, but even Kiran could tell that she was excited.  As per tradition with these festivals, they would have to fight there way through several Heroes.  Kiran couldnt tell you why any of this was necessary.  Did Mspell have some kind of interest in weddings?  He tried to imagine what that would look like, but all he got was Sutr in a wedding dress.  
  
Kiran, are you okay?  Youre pale.  Alfonse asked.  
  
I just imagined something horrible, he said, wiping sweat from his brow.  So whats the situation?  
  
Sharenas excited as usual.  Annas possibly moreso, funnily enough.  In any case, the team should be ready to go at any time.  
  
Kiran nodded.  Right.  Well, we should get started soon.  Better to be early than late, right?  
  
Or we could just not go to a bridal festival in the middle of a war, Alfonse offered.  
  
Yeah, but do you really want to get on Annas bad side?  Shes been looking forward to this for . . . well, since last year.  
  
 . . . Point.  
  
Alfonse and Kiran quickly arrived at the portal to the festival.  Already assembled were Eliwood, and Caeda, each of them wearing appropriate festival attire.  Ah, Lord Alfonse and Sir Kiran, Eliwood greeted with a nod of his head.  We are ready any time.  
  
Great, Alfonse said.  Were just waiting for . . . .  
  
Sorry to keep you waiting!  Sharena said, Anna trailing behind her.  They were both garbed in festival attire and equipped with thematically-appropriate weapons, as per Sharenas request.  All right, lets go!  
  
Just so you know, Im only doing this for the betting pool!  Anna said hotly.  
  
Sure, sure, Eliwood said, smiling slightly.  Caeda graced her with a knowing grin.  
  
No, really!  
  
Just get out of here, Alfonse said, massaging his temples.  Im going to do paperwork because SOMEONE has to.  With that, the squad vanished into the shimmering portal, and Alfonse retreated to his room.  Kiran shrugged and left for the war room, remembering he needed to check with Soren about next weeks movement strategies.

The kiss on her hand made her blush incessantly, and her eyes locked back on Aegon's. Suddenly all her worries fluttered to the back of her mind. She didn't particularly like this stranger, but it was simply the attention that ignited something new within her, and she wanted more of it.

> I was actually the one considering going vegan for Fluttershy, and I reckon she wouldn't be too sad about a person not being vegan. Someone brought up the point that she happily lives with carnivorous animals, but then I'd want to be treated as an equal, not an animal.
  
The difference between humans and carnivorous animals is that the animals follow their natural instincts to not starve, and humans are supposed to think about their actions and their consequences and whether they are moral. If she were real, Fluttershy may not be that upset about a single person's decision to eat meat. She wouldn't be too happy either, but it's so socially acceptable that you can't really fault a person for not being vegan because they've most likely had it hammered into their head their whole lives that killing animals for food is OK. Actually, most of her disgust would be directed towards the meat industry's process of creating and destroying billions of animal lives a year because their flesh tastes good, and our making it possible by funding it.",2018-05-29 02:09:51

OH, maybe I could have avoided lying about my vote after Erica left, actually.... yeah.... but then again maybe that would have shifted the dynamics enough in the house that I wouldn't have had a convincing case to either side about ""being alone"" and needing their votes to stay. OK, I'm back to no regrets. It's a healthier frame of mind! :\)

From what I understood, react compiles into a native UI, then has a built in js interpreter to execute your js code on those native widgets. Conversely flutter maintains an HTML ui but simply styles it (including physics and behaviours) to appear native?

So if your react app implemented a list view, the compiled app will have an OS native list view. And when your js code says add these rows to the view, react is interpreting that then in the background executing the OS native methods for adding to the list view. ",2018-05-29 03:55:46

So with a great flapping and rustling of feathers, the jackdaw came down swiftly and clutched at the coat of a large ram. But when he tried to fly away, he found he could not lift the animal, for his size and strength were not up to the task. And even as the jackdaw struggled, the ram hardly noticed he was there. Nearby, just across the field, the shepherd saw the fluttering bird and was quite amused. Running up, he captured the jackdaw and clipped its wings. That evening he gave the jackdaw to his children as a gift. ""What an odd little bird this is, father!"" they laughed and shouted. ""What do you call him?"" ""This is a jackdaw,"" the father said.

There was this guy, Mr. Cutie, that I was eyeing. He was super cute with his glasses, honey colored complexion, skin fit sweat pants and a tee. He was not very hunky but he was a step ahead of being a twunk. 

On that fine day I was wearing leggings to the gym. While doing my chest routine, Mr. Cutie asked me to help him out with shoulder exercise. I said for sure, with butterflies fluttering inside of me. He was doing the dumbell shoulder press while facing the mirror. Basically he wanted me to support near his elbows from the back. 

As soon as i touched his muscles, i felt a shiver. I felt that the blood was going in a wrong direction. He asked me to move my hands further in towards him. I cursed under my breath as I was able to see a semi hard dick outline on my leggings. He overall did around 20-30 reps in that set and by the time he was done, i was fully hard in public where everybody had a view of my D. 

Thankfully, the guy didn't realize as I ran to the washroom to calm myself down. After my dick was not a raging bitch, i tucked it under the underwear elastic and went outside to help him again. I got the boner again but this time it was controlled. ",2018-05-29 04:28:36

460,"Two comments here already show both sides of the spectrum people tend to fall on. Either:

**1) Don't roll for the NPCs at all.** Have them be as convincing liars, smooth seducers or charismatic salesmen as you need them to be. In this scenario, you sell it via RP skill, the Dice aren't required, unless the PCs decide to dig deeper beneath the cheery facade. 

In which case resolve as a normal, appropriate contested roll. 

**2) Use (likely secret) rolls to inform the conversation.** The NPC lied through their teeth about something, but rolled 8 successes, and they botched to detect it? Then present that information as fact. Tell the players that the NPC looked them square in the eyes, and told them with a moving level of sincerity. Tell them outright things like ""You can see it in his eyes, he's telling you the truth.""

When they ask whether they can roll to see if they're lying or something to that effect, tell them you already have, or give them a second shot as per the 'try again' rules without telling them (+1 Diff). 

In both cases, the aim is to make the social encounter as fluid and organic as possible. This does require a certain amount of precedent; if you roll only when they are being lied to, you're basically announcing it. So I suggest committing to one style or the other.

If you're unable to hide your rolls (Which I strongly recommend!) Throw in 'dummy'/fake rolls, just so it's normal to see you rolling dice each time, so players can't know if it was important or not.

Keep in mind this is for __normal__ conversations. Player Agency is not respected one whit in regards to Dominate and Presence. They get hit by Awe, lay it on thick that the Toreador descending that staircase in that gown made their jaws go slack with amazement and made their still hearts want to flutter.

But really today the big thing is mobile and improving user experience on mobile while lowering development cost.

Today you use two pretty independent teams with one for Android and the other iOS.

So there is that pain.  But then the other is to continue to move things forward and that is Fuchsia but you have the baggage of Android and Flutter provides a vehicle to kill two birds with one stone.

Sadly, it's hard to recreate the Deco's random wobble. You may be able to get close with by stacking multiple vibratos to make the LFO seem random\-\-at subtle settings this might be the ticket. The Drive Echo's wow and flutter by itself is interesting, but doesn't sound like the Deco to me.

 I started on my eyelashes about 2 years ago really vigorously and stopped about a month ago. I felt shunned when people would point it out or watch me do it in public. I feel so good when I can feel them fluttering over my finger or see them in a mirror. My eyes looked weird being bald and really wrinkly but I feel great now. It was so hard at first, and likely it'll be a few months more before they are completely back, but you can beat it. I beat it and I want more people to realize the seriousness of trichotillomania.

""Assange is a flaky fame whore, always fluttering from one sudden crazy grandiose lightning strike of an idea to the next, but he can't commit to any of his them long enough to complete them, and he's always trying to con someone else to do the work or steal credit for it"" check.

""Assange has Autistism, so you should feel sorry for the guy and tune out whatever nutty things he says"" check.

My god man this homosexual glory hole aficionado author cranked out 20,000 words about Assange AND HE COMPLETELY MISSED THE FUCKING POINT OF ASSANGE AND WIKIKEAKS.

This tripe is obvious Kill The Messenger tabloid pornography and I'm glad Assange axed his hitjob autobiography.

What you think you're getting: Alex Haley's Autobiography of Malcom X.

VS.

What you actually get: competitive fiction worthy of the Bulwer-Lyton Award for worst opening sentence (it was a dark and stormy night...).

Here's my litmus test for ANYTHING written about Assange:
do they talk about a single specific goddamn page of Top Secrets leaked by Wikileaks which particularly struck them as profoundly revelatory or jolting to their NeolibCon safe space bubble?

If not, into the trash they go.

Any human under a microscope becomes a tangled yarn of contradictions and follies and mistakes.

But I find it incredulous that this author who is seeking fame himself can scribble 100,000 words about Assange but not have one nice thing to say about the guy.

483,"*Warning: Unusually tasteless content. Its a silly answer to a silly prompt.*

""I've done it!"", exclaimed Becky Lowenstein, the finest scientist of the 21st century. ""I've discovered a new hole! Now we just have to test it and my third Nobel Prize is assured!""

What on Earth are you raving about? asked her colleague Brad.

A new fuckhole! Becky clarified. To use the scientific term. A previously undiscovered hole which is usually closed but, when pushed open, is about the right size to stick a penis into. I cant find any other possible use for it.

What nonsense, Brad scoffed. How could such a large hole have gone unnoticed throughout human history?

Well, it doesnt exist in most humans, said Becky. Its a rare condition that to our knowledge develops only in women who undergo particular types of surgery. At first we assumed it was a side effect, until we discovered that the hole often develops *before* any surgery. Moreover, its correlated with surgeries such as nosejobs, breast implants, and liposuction, which have nothing in common physically; the only thing they have in common is their cosmetic goal. Therefore the hole must be somehow caused by something that also causes the desire to get plastic surgery.

Where is this supposed hole? asked Brad.

Strangely, the hole is located in the roof of the mouth and leads to the brain. If my calculations are correct, it can be penetrated by thrusting a penis into the mouth at an upward angle and pushing hard. I dont know if its safe, but I have a brave patient who has volunteered to try it and Im very curious to do so, preferably before an ethics committee gets wind of it because theyd never agree to it. Thats why I came to you, Brad. I know how much you love fucking my face, so I thought you could help out my patient.

Sure, Im happy to help, said Brad. Lead the way.

Becky turned and walked back the way she had come.

Brad followed her, slipping his hand into his pocket so he could rub his hardening dick as he watched Beckys ass sway from side to side. Brad was a closet male-chauvinist and believed women should be sex objects rather than scientists. Becky was the only female scientist he actually liked, because she let him fuck her face all the time, though she didnt know he fantasized about her being a brainless bimbo as he fucked her. He still wasnt sure he believed the strange claims Becky was making, but if Becky had got it into her head to ask him to face-fuck her patient, he wasnt going to question that.

Brad, meet Bridgette, said Becky, indicating a woman wearing an EEG. Bridgette, meet Brad.

Bridgette had long blonde hair, puffy lips, and massive fake breasts. She looked Brad up and down, her eyes lingering on the tent in his pants, and fluttered her eyelashes approvingly. Hi Brad.

Hi Bridge, said Brad. Becky didnt mention youre such a hot babe.

Bridgette giggled delightedly. How did you guess my nickname? Youre so smart!

Now Bridgette, said Becky. This might be your last chance to back out. Are you still sure you want to do this?

I cant wait! Bridgette replied. And nor can Brad! She giggled again and nodded toward Brads crotch.

Brad didnt need any more encouragement. He pulled down his pants, revealing his hard cock, and moved toward Bridgette.

Just a minute! Becky rushed over to her computer to watch the EEG readings. Alright, now you can start.

Bridgette opened her mouth wide, drooling a bit. Brads dick was already erect enough for him to shove it in at an upward angle and thrust it hard into the roof of her mouth. After a few thrusts in slightly different directions, he found the right spot and it opened wide to allow him in. He thrust his dick deep into the mysterious new hole.

Bridgette suddenly started moaning in ecstasy.

Ooh yeah, that feels fucking incredible, groaned Brad.

Oh wow, said Becky, staring in amazement at her screen. Youre penetrating right into her brain and interacting with her neurons! Her whole pleasure center has lit up, youre right next to it and stimulating it through direct contact. No wonder shes enjoying it so much. Let me see what else is nearby.

Mmm, that sounds interesting, honey, said Brad, not listening as he thrust in and out of Bridgettes head with increasing vigour. Yeah, you love my dick, dont you, you horny fucking slut?

Mmmm! Bridgette agreed.

Wait, youre actually penetrating some of the most important parts of the brain, said Becky. Youre thrusting right through them, that has to be having some effect. And directly in front of your dick is  Oh no! Brad, is your dick still growing?!

What? Oh yeah, Im only half-hard, babe, said Brad, thrusting harder and faster into Bridgette, who was getting an oddly blank look in her eyes that turned on Brad even more.

Becky froze in horror, staring at her screen as she realized a large volume of brain cells were going dark as Brad pulverized and distorted the neural connections. And as Brads dick expanded and penetrated ever further, it was about to reach an even more important region.

Brad! screamed Becky. You to have to stop the experiment now! Youre fucking her brains out!

Huh? What? said Brad, still thrusting away enthusiastically.

Youre literally killing her brain cells!

To Beckys horror, rather than pulling out, Brads dick suddenly expanded to its full size and broke into the final region, as if Brad was turned on by the thought of killing Bridgettes brain cells.

Brad, Im serious! Pull out now! Becky yelled.

Brad finally came to his senses and, fighting his base impulses, tried to pull out. Bridgettes hands flew up to Brads butt and pushed his whole pelvis back into her face.

Ooh! said Brad. I dont think we can stop! She wont stop because of the pleasure!

He was right. Becky observed that Bridgettes pleasure center was still fully operational, safely adjacent to the path of penetration so that it was stimulated but not damaged. However, most of the regions associated with higher reasoning were suffering major damage.

Oh my God, said Becky. My career is over. Forget ethics committees, she might be jailed for life. Well, she figured, she might as well focus entirely on scientific curiosity now.

Becky watched the screen as Brads dick cleared away ever more of Bridgettes brain cells. He really was fucking her brains out. She wondered if this was where the expression came from. Maybe some ancient people had known about this and their knowledge had been lost?

Brad had likewise dropped any pretence of caring for the patient. Fuck yeah, take that fucking cock, you dumb bimbo! he breathed, fucking her brain like it was a toy. Yeah, you like how Im fucking your brains out?

Mmm! Bridgette agreed.

Bimbo muttered Becky. She thought back to the strangely specific demographic of women who had developed these brain holes: women who wanted plastic surgeries like fake breasts and fake lips. She remembered how Bridgette had giggled and told Brad: Youre so smart! Even when shed had a brain, she hadnt been very keen to use it. What if what if Bridgette had, in a way, *wanted* her brains fucked out?

Shit, Im gonna cum! Brad groaned.

Becky watched the screen as liquid shot out of Brads dick and settled into what remained of Bridgettes brain.

Bridgette finally let Brads softening dick slip out of her mouth. Need more cum she said faintly.

She has cum on the brain, said Becky. Im guessing all her remaining brain functions have been redirected to the singular goal of sexually pleasuring men.

Wow, said Brad, gazing down at the blank-faced bimbo drooling a mixture of fluids out of her dick-sucking lips.

Bridgette, do you understand me? asked Becky. Can you tell us what it was like having your brains fucked?

La la la, la la la la la, sang Bridgette. La la la, la la la la la.

Thats a Kylie Minogue song, Becky observed. She clearly retains some musical memory, so some of her brain functions still work, but I dont think shes capable of normal human functioning anymore. Shell probably have to go into a mental institution.

I could look after her, Brad volunteered.

Oh, thats very generous of you, Brad, said Becky. And she did seem to take a liking to you, so maybe its what shed have wanted.

But I still dont get why all this happened, said Brad slowly. Where did that weird hole thing come from?

My new hypothesis, Becky explained. Is that the brain hole is developed only by women who have a fetish, I guess, for being bimbofied. So basically, they are developing the means of living out their fantasy. We can easily test that by surveying the other women with brain holes and asking if they have such a fantasy. If we can prove that, then well have proved Bridgette wanted us to do this to her. So maybe my career isnt over.

In the ensuing months, Becky went on to prove her hypothesis, and set up a clinic for bimbofying women who consented to it. Brad became her surgeon, a fancy title for the man who fucked out the brains of each wannabe bimbo. And at night, he went home and fucked his very own bimbo Bridgette in all four holes.",2018-05-29 15:19:56
484,"Im about 90% anal only. I have pretty severe PE so we dont use my penis much. We have our own strap ons. I do her for about 20 minutes (without her cumming) then its my turn. We both need to be riding at a 9.8 on the horny scale and I cum within a few minutes of her entering me. I can cum for literally 5 minutes straight, take a minute break and cum again for another 5minutes. I find the hardest thing is to remember to breathe. I get faint and then the waves stop. Its like I can orgasm forever if I can just remember to breathe. Then once Im done I mount her again and she cums on her dildo a few more times and we call it a night. 

The best advice for how to have an anal orgasm is in order:

1) Stop ejaculating. I cant get anywhere close to an anal orgasm unless its been a full week since I had a penis orgasm. You should be feeling those little flutters in your gut after your piss. That means youre ripe. Patience. You can and should still have sex, just edge. No ejaculating. 

2) Find the right toy. You dont need width, you need the exact spot to be pushed at the back at the exact right pressure. You know it when its happening. Its like someone is punching a button and the wave makes you involuntarily groan. If your not feeling that, your not hitting your button and wasting your time with that toy. Yeah I know you paid 75 bucks but its not for you, throw it out and find another one. 

3) The comparison to a female vaginal orgasm is real! In comparing where my wifes headspace has to be and where mine has to be is identical. You NEED to find your feminine side. This is crucial. You can feel the spot all day long but you need to relax and be comfortable with your sexuality. Be ok with rubbing your thighs or your bum or your nipples. Be ok to cry. I sobbed the first ten times I came anally and still cry sometimes. I get how that sounds but you need to let your headspace get wherever it needs to go. This is 90% mental; 10% physical. If youre a high strung dude with issues that $&@@& staying in that &$$@& closet give up right now. You will never get there. 

4) Find your jam. Keep exploring. The prostate massagers (aneros etc) for me hit the spot perfect but Ive never been able to go over for some unexplained reason. I can only go over with my wife. She tells me what I need to hear (something to the effect of that Im a sissy faggot loser who cant satisfy her) and for some slightly fucked up reason that makes me feel accepted and loved and I tell her so. Thats the catalyst I need to get me there. Its not the words; yours might be something totally different, its that she accepts what I need and I feel accepted and loved. Thats what makes me orgasm over and over. 

5) And I put this last as its the least important but I know its what you want to hear its how to catch the wave.... the orgasm is TOTALLY different than penis. If you can forget your penis orgasm you would be able to have an anal one way easier. Your penis orgasm youre used to is to rise to the top of a mountain then fall off. Thats not this at all so get that out of your head. This is more like a muscle spasm. Like youre a canoe on calm seas then someone starts to slowly rock it. At first youre like hmmm that feels good but its nothing thats it... thats the feeling youre looking for. Focus on that. Im a full minute into orgasm with sweat rolling down my face before I realize Im actually having an orgasm. My internal voice is saying when is this going to happen??? I mean this feels good but when am I going to cum??? Then I notice Im holding my breath and Im like why am I holding my breathe? Im not even... oh!! I am! Holy shit I think this is it! This is the thought all through the orgasm. There is no falling off a cliff. If thats what youre waiting for its not coming. Just ride the wave. When the wave stops or youre just too tired to keep going it will stop. The funny thing is my wife usually has a comment like holy shit honey you looked like you had an insane orgasm! And I will be like I did? Because I didnt get that crash at the end. As for ejaculation its always a surprise. After my biggest anal orgasms I look down and Im dry. After some that I think are the smallest orgasms I look down and it looks like I emptied a full cup of cum at some point and didnt even notice. Key to ejaculation and anal orgasm is if you think youre orgasming and you look down at your penis and its soft and dry your brain will scramble and say what the fuck? Im not even horny? And the feeling of being disjointed from the ecstasy youre feeling and the evidence your eyes can see will be plenty enough to crash you back to earth and stop the wave. IGNORE YOUR PENIS! If youre jacking while doing anal youre not having an anal orgasm end of story so stop it or just be ok not knowing an anal orgasm. Just remember to unhook orgasm from ejaculation (your penis). If you cum or dont cum it has no bearing on your enjoyment. 

I can say with 100% certainty I prefer anal orgasms any day. I feel energized, almost electric after as opposed to down and lethargic. It doesnt matter how many times I orgasm anally I can keep going if I want and I can still get hard even if I ejaculate. 

At this point the only reason I have penis orgasms are for my wife. About once a month she says she just wants to feel me cum inside her for intimacy. And I always oblige because she is so good to me to explore all this. Many women would be too insecure to even try. 

Im a lucky guy.

485,"I'm actually very upset about this...my grand father was a strong willed italian man who didn't take shit from anyone. He was diagnosed with leukemia after he noticed he would be tired returning home from church. Walked himself to get communion up until the very end...he put on a smile and because of that..very few people in his community knew he was sick until he was in hospice. 

My family lives out of state so when we got the call this could be it, we piled into the car and drove 12 hours to go see him off. we thought we would be able to speak to him but he was too high on the morphine to even notice us. I could see it was hurting my father, his son, in a very deep way.

486,"OK, keep in mind, I was a child at the time, so I don't trust these experiences as much as adult ones, but there were A LOT of them, and very few of them made any sense.

We lived in a suburban neighborhood house, it couldn't have been more than 20\-30 years old, and it really wasn't the slightest bit creepy or it shouldn't have been.

The first one was the ghost my younger sister and I saw together. 

My parents bedroom was the whole upstairs \- the stairs just let out into their room. Downstairs were our bedrooms. It was a Saturday am and we're up early watching cartoons and my parents are still asleep.

We see someone coming down the steps and around the landing to the bottom half of the steps. \(Did we hear anything? I don't remember\).

It was a lady, about 70 years old, gray hair up in a nice bun, long dress or nightgown of some sort, and holding a book in one hand. She just walked down to the bottom, around the corner towards the front door, and disappeared.

Being kids, we weren't overly shocked by this, we thought she was just a person for some reason coming out of my parents bedroom, until she disappeared. She wasn't scary or anything, although we call her ""The Librarian"" now since the Ghostbusters lady reminded us a bit of her. We saw her in 1980, the movie came out in 1984 \- but also, our librarian wasn't mean.

We often heard someone walking down the downstairs hallway in the middle of the night. From the front of the house through to the back \- as if they were walking straight through the house \(but there were no entrances or exits on that hallway, just bedrooms\). Never saw anything \(never looked!\), but it always freaked me out, as we were two kids alone downstairs. 

We used to see what I can only describe as a ""mist"" moving about downstairs, usually to and from the front door area. It was a diffuse mistly, vaguely human\-sized oval mist. It never did anything except appear and move from one location to another, then dissipate.

In the front bedroom, which was mine but which I never slept in, I would see weird things that just didn't make any sense. I'm not even sure why they scared me, but they did.

We used to wait outside the house after school each day for a parent to get home that evening since we were too scared to be in there alone. We'd play in the driveway, etc. You could see into my bedroom window from out there. 

I'd see things moving in there like what appeared to be an orange pair of pants or fabric cut into pants shape \- bright orange \- fluttering from the ceiling. I'd see lots of geometrical moving things in there, both from outside looking in, and from inside the room or hallway itself, like a big yellow rectangle fluttering around in the corner or the orange pants shape. Honestly,  I can't tell you why I was so terrified of them, they didn't even have faces. 

\(And no, it wasn't a reflection. All the windows in the house were louvered and sort of pebbled with a rough surface, and they were ALWAYS open because the weather is always amazing there. So you'd be looking in through the open slats, not through the actual glass\)

So, there you go. Like I said, just weirdness.",2018-05-29 16:39:57

523,"Kotlin is the clear choice now, but [Kotlin/native](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/native-overview.html) didn't exist when the Flutter team was switching off of JavaScript. They wanted to compete with React\-native with instant deploys for development, which means an interpreted language, but they also can't use a JIT on iOS devices, so they needed a language that could also be ahead\-of\-time compiled. Since Google owns Dart, they could customize Dart to meet their requirements.

That being said, I'm not a fan of Dart the language, and while there are a few super outspoken developers for Dart, the majority of the developer community has stayed away from the language, and it hasn't really found much usage outside of Google. You can see this clearly in the languages ecosystem, as it has relatively few OSS libraries that are actively maintained by non\-Google parties.

I think when you actually sit down and try to use Dart it's clear why people aren't flocking to it. At first glance you think it's basically Java, and that by switching to it from something like Kotlin, you'll just be downgrading to Java again. The problem is, I find Dart to be worse than Java. While syntactically similar, it lacks certain features that make it a pain to use. I don't have an exhaustive list of what Dart lacks, but it doesn't take long when coding to start getting frustrated. There are no anonymous inner classes. Try getting a member variable given by the constructor to `final`. The language doesn't have any enums, much less anything like Kotlin's sealed classes, and you are also limited to a single thread (which is very limiting for mobile development). There are parts of the language that I like (async / await, and their integration with code-generation), **but once you find yourself going through the hassle of trying to generate Dart code to work around a lack of language features, you've entered a new kind of nonsense that most developers aren't willing to put up with.**

## Is Flutter even worth it?
Here's the deal: 2018 is the year of mobile cross-platform. At the beginning of 2019, we will have 3 production-ready cross-platform options that can be used to share code between Android, iOS, and Web. **react-native, Flutter, and Kotlin/native**. What does Flutter offer us over react-native? The answer is really not that much. It doesn't solve any problems that react-native has, and also has the same limitations that react-native has (I'm primarily talking about single threaded execution, and in order to communicate with native code, you have to serialize and deserialize everything). The difference is that react-native has a mature js ecosystem that comes along with it, and Flutter doesn't.

Kotlin/native offers a different advantage pro/con set. You can get native performance 100% of the time at the cost of writing your own native view for each platform (but don't you have to do that with react-native and Flutter most of the time anyways?). You can share all code between the platforms except for the View implementation. If Flutter were written in Kotlin/native, it wouldn't have to be this separate entity, but rather could be viewed as a complement to Kotlin/native for sharing View logic between the platforms. This is a much more interesting value proposition to me. 

As it currently stands, I see Flutter and react-native competing for the same developers, and I just don't think that Flutter can hold it's own against react-native right now. I think a lot of that has to do with their decision to use Dart.",2018-05-29 20:27:16

People temporarily are enjoying it because it's new \(it's fun to learn new things!\), and there is an interesting value proposition, but react\-native or Kotlin multi\-platform projects can be just as fun, if not more fun, because you'll soon find that you don't have to reinvent the wheel to do basic things.",2018-05-29 20:31:37

530,"The mind was a wonderful thing. How it worked, twisted and coiled round and round its own center in order to justify whatever stimulus seemed to risk penetrating whatever shell or shield or morality it had erected around itself. It did whatever it could to continue existing, to stave off madness or guilt or trauma. There was no game of thrones, as one maester had put it, only as Darick had slowly realized- a game of minds. And this was played by any man or woman, from servant and milkmaid to King and Empress. He played one right now, and Cassandra with him, even if she wasn't aware of it. She probably was, he considered, though it wasn't necessarily true. 


""A shame that the home of the Estermonts was not kind to members of the fairer sex."" he said, not really sure whether to make it an explicit jest or jab. ""Though I wonder what compelled you to stay, in that case. Unless you mean to insinuate that your name alone provided you sufficiently proper treatment, or the vineyard sufficient comfort."" 


He did notice how her hand wandered over the top of her abdomen- something to do with pregnancy, perhaps. Still, Cassandra did not look like a woman who had undergone childbirth, at least not from what he could see. To measure it properly he would need to check for stretchmarks around the abdomen, or perhaps check the size and enlargement of the breasts, feel their firmness...


Blinking, he found himself staring at her again, though it must have been only a moment, and he glanced away almost immediately upon catching himself. Hands slightly shaking, he lifted his pipe to his mouth and took another long puff. 


There it was. That coquettish, flirtatious flutter of the heavy eyelashes. He'd seen it years before, though never on him. She hadn't needed that for him back then. Nonetheless, he suddenly could feel the blood pumping through his body, and he crossed his legs. 


""Jon Estermont?"" he asked, surprised at the question. He wondered if there was some history there between them. Perhaps they were enemies- Cassandra had been Orys' paramour, and Jon seemed to very much opposed to his brother's ways- a fact that Darick hoped to discuss further at some point. Or perhaps they had been lovers at some point- they had had the proximity, had they not? ""Had a mental breakdown of sorts, I believe. Left with Oswell to whatever celebrations they had planned in the Reach. Would you happen to have any particular interest in him? I can always inform you further about his health."" 


It was interesting, how she must view him, or at least she pretended to view him. He'd noticed the *Lord Castellan* used. That had been exciting, actually now that he reflected upon it. Gave him a strange feeling. And now she commented on his past, how he'd change. What could she be implying, he wondered. Darick certainly didn't feel much different, though obviously he must have been, and quite a bit. But it had been so long. 


And yet the memory was so fresh. 


""You know, Cassandra, I don't think I can say the same about you."" softly smiling, he leaned forward. There was a sense of *deja-vu* in this. ""In fact, I'd like to imagine that you are the same exact sort of woman I met at Summerhall. In every meaning of the word."" ",2018-05-29 21:55:02

He heard Xarik deny them, then heard nothing else. Saw nothing else. 

All faded save for the arrhythmic fluttering of his own heart, the well of blood in his eyes, ears, and mouth.  Hed drown in his helm on his own life. 

**+Rage is folly.+**

The press of jaws around his mind subsided, insubstantial fangs slid from his mind. 

**+Rage is folly.+**

The bottomless hunger hollowing out his guts into a bottomless well tightened until his appetites were his own again. 

**+Rage is folly.+**

All was but an ever present scraping at the edges of his mind, like teeth trying to scrape away his mind, jarring the hastily erected wards of his mind. Malmed had watched. Malmed had stayed the fury of the paired Coil Brothers without lecture or sermon. A snarl of hoarse whisperings and choked breaths spattered the insides of his consciousness. Hroshidur was beckoning him, moving with Alcinon to move away from the massed Legionnaires. 

Rellian, the pugnacious dog, had seen none of it. The High Acolyte wondered on whether the warrior knew the same pain as he. He could see the large warrior again, and with his tongue no longer swelling up to choke his throat he spoke his parting words. 

I am very sorry to hear that, Lord Rellian. 

Then he too turned, walking after the daemarines, whod broken into an easy gallop on all fours and vaulted up the sheer face of their original perch. Lorhal was ever, moved behind him. 

*+What now?+*  she pulsed, clearly irate. 

*+We leave+* he broadcasted to she and the hidden acolytes. 

One by one the lights of their lenses vanished in the dark of the abandoned dwelling, the monstrous warrior-beasts gone from view. Only the High Acolyte and his taller companion were visible to Xarik, their flaps of their robes snatched by the return of freak wind. It had returned with a vengeance, sucking everything lighter than an average man towards a cloudy epicenter. 

Motes of dust and loose rubble were dredged up off the ground, flung skyward to obscure the retreating forms of the Void Maws. From the vantage of Xariks warriors they could just make out the rising tips of an obsidian tri-spire, the sinister points piercing the heavens to absorb a rapidly condensing stream of unworldly lightning. 

Lances of it long enough to streak from horizon to horizon snapped between the disparate cloud layers, drunk in by the growing spire tips. It no longer sounded like thunder when the lightning struck, leaving the imprints of hideous faces within the clouds. Across windows. In the sudden static-wash of shorted helm-displays. 

It sounded like laughter, tectonic and booming down from a reigning hell.

In your experience, did any medication help with the vertigo?

539,"> Im about 90% anal only. I have pretty severe PE so we dont use my penis much. We have our own strap ons. I do her for about 20 minutes (without her cumming) then its my turn. We both need to be riding at a 9.8 on the horny scale and I cum within a few minutes of her entering me. I can cum for literally 5 minutes straight, take a minute break and cum again for another 5minutes. I find the hardest thing is to remember to breathe. I get faint and then the waves stop. Its like I can orgasm forever if I can just remember to breathe. Then once Im done I mount her again and she cums on her dildo a few more times and we call it a night.


Well I havent graduated to a strapon as yet. I dont have PE and enjoy sex regularly.
> 
> The best advice for how to have an anal orgasm is in order:
> 
> 1) Stop ejaculating. I cant get anywhere close to an anal orgasm unless its been a full week since I had a penis orgasm. You should be feeling those little flutters in your gut after your piss. That means youre ripe. Patience. You can and should still have sex, just edge. No ejaculating.

Ok...this is hard...in the last 20 years I dont think I have gone more than 3 days without ejaculating. I will give this a shot but how do you  deal with all that pent up angst.
> 
> 2) Find the right toy. You dont need width, you need the exact spot to be pushed at the back at the exact right pressure. You know it when its happening. Its like someone is punching a button and the wave makes you involuntarily groan. If your not feeling that, your not hitting your button and wasting your time with that toy. Yeah I know you paid 75 bucks but its not for you, throw it out and find another one.


I get this from basically any of the 3 toys I have tried...Helix Syn (just right), Progasm Ice (which feels like too much pressure for me right now) and Lelo Hugo 
(just got it...played with it once and it was pretty good)
> 
> 3) The comparison to a female vaginal orgasm is real! In comparing where my wifes headspace has to be and where mine has to be is identical. You NEED to find your feminine side. This is crucial. You can feel the spot all day long but you need to relax and be comfortable with your sexuality. Be ok with rubbing your thighs or your bum or your nipples. Be ok to cry. I sobbed the first ten times I came anally and still cry sometimes. I get how that sounds but you need to let your headspace get wherever it needs to go. This is 90% mental; 10% physical. If youre a high strung dude with issues that $&@@& staying in that &$$@& closet give up right now. You will never get there.

I'm high strung but I am well pass not getting in touch with that side.I really like my anal toys. I have been progressing over the last 2 months with them really well. My nipples dont do anything for me unfortunately.

> 
> 4) Find your jam. Keep exploring. The prostate massagers (aneros etc) for me hit the spot perfect but Ive never been able to go over for some unexplained reason. I can only go over with my wife. She tells me what I need to hear (something to the effect of that Im a sissy faggot loser who cant satisfy her) and for some slightly fucked up reason that makes me feel accepted and loved and I tell her so. Thats the catalyst I need to get me there. Its not the words; yours might be something totally different, its that she accepts what I need and I feel accepted and loved. Thats what makes me orgasm over and over.

Interesting...I dont know what that is as yet. What did you do to find this?

> 
> 5) And I put this last as its the least important but I know its what you want to hear its how to catch the wave.... the orgasm is TOTALLY different than penis. If you can forget your penis orgasm you would be able to have an anal one way easier. Your penis orgasm youre used to is to rise to the top of a mountain then fall off. Thats not this at all so get that out of your head. This is more like a muscle spasm. Like youre a canoe on calm seas then someone starts to slowly rock it. At first youre like hmmm that feels good but its nothing thats it... thats the feeling youre looking for. Focus on that. Im a full minute into orgasm with sweat rolling down my face before I realize Im actually having an orgasm. My internal voice is saying when is this going to happen??? I mean this feels good but when am I going to cum??? Then I notice Im holding my breath and Im like why am I holding my breathe? Im not even... oh!! I am! Holy shit I think this is it! This is the thought all through the orgasm. There is no falling off a cliff. If thats what youre waiting for its not coming. Just ride the wave. When the wave stops or youre just too tired to keep going it will stop. The funny thing is my wife usually has a comment like holy shit honey you looked like you had an insane orgasm! And I will be like I did? Because I didnt get that crash at the end. As for ejaculation its always a surprise. After my biggest anal orgasms I look down and Im dry. After some that I think are the smallest orgasms I look down and it looks like I emptied a full cup of cum at some point and didnt even notice. Key to ejaculation and anal orgasm is if you think youre orgasming and you look down at your penis and its soft and dry your brain will scramble and say what the fuck? Im not even horny? And the feeling of being disjointed from the ecstasy youre feeling and the evidence your eyes can see will be plenty enough to crash you back to earth and stop the wave. IGNORE YOUR PENIS! If youre jacking while doing anal youre not having an anal orgasm end of story so stop it or just be ok not knowing an anal orgasm. Just remember to unhook orgasm from ejaculation (your penis). If you cum or dont cum it has no bearing on your enjoyment.

So I do get the feeling. I get where the aneros kind of gets a mind of its own...it starts very subtle and then it just increases. The problem I have is when I notice it is happening it's almost as if I brace myself for something big...so it lasts for like 20-30 seconds and then it subsides. My guess is I'm not nearly far enough from my last ejaculation. Any other pointers here?
> 
> I can say with 100% certainty I prefer anal orgasms any day. I feel energized, almost electric after as opposed to down and lethargic. It doesnt matter how many times I orgasm anally I can keep going if I want and I can still get hard even if I ejaculate.
> 
> At this point the only reason I have penis orgasms are for my wife. About once a month she says she just wants to feel me cum inside her for intimacy. And I always oblige because she is so good to me to explore all this. Many women would be too insecure to even try.
> 
> Im a lucky guy.
> 
> If you have questions, fire away.

Just a taste of the quotes below.

 Fear to Tread said:

>*And the same report from several others now The tinny mutter of overlapping communications signals was audible from the brassy pod. She held it away, trying to compose herself as best a woman could when she had such news to impart. Primarch, the captain of the Chalice and several picket ships around the edges of the flotilla are reporting the occurrence of an unusual astronomical phenomenon.*  
*Sanguinius turned back to the great portal and peered out, past the fires of ruined Phorus. Azkaellon came closer, and as he did he heard the Angel release a gasp.*  
*Sanguinius pointed, raising his gauntlet to the void. There. Do you see it?*  
*The Guard Commander grimaced as he looked; then he too felt his breath catch in his throat.* ***The stars***  
***Beyond the baleful red glow of Signus Alpha and the shimmers of its sister suns, the scattering of stars and nebulae that lay within sight of the Red Tear were changing. Azkaellon had the sudden impression of a colossal curtain falling across a stage the size of a galaxy. A great veil, impenetrable and Stygian, blotting out everything.***  
***Struck silent, he stood at the Angels side and watched the stars go out.***  
*\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_*  
*The Sanguinary Guard produced a data\-slate and read aloud from it.* ***This is from the fleet log. Picket ships among the sternguard wings report that an opaque mass resembling a black cloud has formed, six\-point\-three light days beyond the designated outer marker of the Signus Cluster. Long\-range optical observations in all directions appear to support the conclusion that this mass has completely shrouded the system.***  
*Is it some form of displacement? said Galan. There are stories of worlds falling wholesale into the immaterium after catastrophic warp space events. Could that happen to an entire star system, and to us along with it?*  
***Nearby, Metriculus stroked his chin, dismissing the question. The energy to achieve such a result would likely be greater than the sum total output of the galaxy itself. It is irrational to conceive it.***  
*Are these rational times? Redknifes reply was almost a whisper.*  
*The primarch shook his head slowly. We remain in normal space, Captain Galan. Our Navigators confirm this to us, although they report that they have lost all contact with warp beacons beyond the line of the veil.*  
*Chronometrics have been affected, Zuriel reported, and so too have our communications. Vox\-signals directed into the cloud mass are reflected back. The astropaths... He hesitated, shooting the Angel a look before continuing. An astropath aboard the Ignis attempted to make a sending through the barrier. He claimed he was assailed by screaming, maddened echoes of his own telepathic voice.*

 Masque of Slaanesh causes the planets of a solar system to move by dancing, causing their orbits to shift and accompany the moving of her arms and legs and body, and making them align in a Slaaneshi symbol. And then she causes the system's sun to go supernova by warping her Daemon Palace\-thing into a dagger and having it pierce the star's heart. 

They encounter a **Solar\-System sized space fortress** blocking their way. The fortress has its own gravitational pull that attracts them even though they are millions of miles away, and they quickly realize that the Fortress is impossible:

***Spoiler***\*:\*  
*The Invincible Reason plunged towards the wall of an impossible fortress. The Lion stared at the vision, and for several seconds his mind was unable to reconcile the structure with its size. It would have inspired awe had he seen it from the cockpit of a Thunderhawk. From the bridge of a ship, it beggared belief. He looked upon twisted, spiked battlements and towers of brass and iron. They rose from a wall that stretched to port and starboard as far as the Lion could see. The wall bristled with what, from this distance, looked like thorns and claws. The glow of ugly fires shone from innumerable apertures, a galaxy of pinprick flames. Light the colour of blood and hate moved over the fortifications, a nebula of horror.*  
*The fortress filled the oculus, the wall dropping beyond the frame. There was nothing to see except the battlements, nothing to give the structure scale, but at last the Lion grasped its full monstrosity. The fortress spanned a system. The wall was tens of millions of miles high. It was billions of miles long. And though the proximity was lethal, it was still millions of miles away.*  
*The fleets were caught in its gravitational well. They sailed across the void before it, pulled towards a collision, minute specks of dust blown at a mountainside.*  
*Hard to starboard, Captain Stenius ordered. In his command throne one level below the Lions position, he leaned forwards, pulling at the mechadendrites that linked him to the Invincible Reason, as if he could lend the ship greater mobility by the actions of his body.*  
*The Lion opened a fleet\-wide vox\-channel, and heard the same command echoing and re\-echoing. It was too late to attempt to reverse away from the fortress. But the ships might yet avoid disaster by taking the momentum into a turn, moving parallel to the barrier using a slingshot manoeuvre to break the walls grip. The Lion shifted his attention back and forth between the monster growing larger in the oculus, and the trajectory screens for the combined fleets. The lines were shifting, slowly. The fortress was coming closer, quickly. The prow of the Reason shuddered before the Lions gaze, mile upon mile of gothic majesty wrenched by forces that reduced it to insignificance.*  
*Hails from the Red Tear and the Samothrace, said the vox\-officer.*  
*Private channel, the Lion said. His brothers wished to speak to him. As he had expected they would.*  
*Where have you brought us? Guilliman demanded.*  
*I dont know, Roboute.*  
*Neither do I. We cant identify the system, whatever it once was.*  
*If this is a system, it has been moved, Sanguinius said. But the location is not as important as its nature. This is not the work of Horus. It cannot be the work of material hands, be they human or xenos.*

The Fortress has War\-Horns the size of Gas Giants, which emit waves of sound that cross the millions of miles between it and the Primarchs' fleet nearly instantly. The laws of physics have little meaning inside the Ruinstorm:

***Spoiler***\*:\*  
*The Lion turned back to the oculus. The angle of the Invincible Reasons approach had become oblique, though the fortress was so vast, its expanse stretched for an eternity into the void, glowing and pulsing with its unnatural fire. Conical shapes jutted out from the battlements at irregular intervals. They were the size of gas giants. They could not be what they appeared to be.*  
*Sanguinius confirmed the madness.Theyre war\-horns, he said. His tone was flat, and leaden with prophecy.*  
*The horns blared a challenge. Across the airless void, they made their terrible, warp\-created sound. It travelled the millions of miles that separated the fleet from the fortress. Perhaps the cry had come as soon as the fleets had been detected and it was only now reaching the ships. Perhaps the horns had only sounded on the instant. The laws of reality had been suspended in this star system, and the Lion knew that what mattered was not how the horns cried, but that they did. The sound smashed into the Invincible Reason, shaking the hull. It boomed through the bridge. It was deep, as deep as the heartbeat of mountains. And it was a wail, a rising, shrieking, raging wail that harrowed the soul. The Lion winced. He made himself breathe through the blast. He leaned into it. On the bridge below, officers screamed, blood running from their ears and eyes. Servitors collapsed, spines ground to powder. The electrical systems of the ship surged and stuttered, blowing out pict screens, setting control stations ablaze. The thrum of the battleships engines became a hammering roar, yet the cry of the horns sounded above everything.*

In desperation, the Primarchs command the entire fleet to shoot at the Fortress, hoping they can burst a path through it. They vaporize enough metal to create a crater as wide of the whole fleet and four thousand miles deep. It does nothing:

***Spoiler***\*:\*  
*Do any of us think we can destroy it? the Lion asked.*  
*We are all agreed that we must try, said Guilliman.*  
*The greatest single naval barrage in human history occurred less than an hour later. Hulls vibrating from the strain of engines pushing back against the pull of the fortress, the formation closed to firing range with the construct. The wall filled the oculus of the Invincible Reason completely. The Lion could see nothing but the iron, the brass, the flames and the thorns resolving themselves into guns taller than Olympus Mons.*  
*The weapons systems of the Imperium powered up. When they were ready, when the synchronisation of fire was arranged, when the speed of torpedoes was calculated against the immediacy of lances, so that every hit would strike the wall at the same moment, then the Lion, in concert with his brothers, said, Fire.*  
*Fire.*  
*The fire came to burn the void. More than a hundred ships opened up with every weapon. Macro\-cannon batteries, ranks of lances, nova cannons, cyclonic torpedoes and more unleashed the anger of humanity against the obscenity before them. The raging of the Ruinstorm faded before the searing light of purest, purging destruction. It was an act of war on a scale that had never been witnessed before. If there had been remembrancers aboard any of the vessels, they would have felt compelled to record an event so monumental in song and in verse.*  
*The barrage struck the fortress, and then it did not matter that there were no remembrancers. The action would not be remembered. There would be no songs. The immense became the insignificant. The explosions that erupted on the face of the battlements lit up the view in the Invincible Reasons oculus. But the Lion made the mental adjustment, and understood how tiny the site of the impact was in relation to the wall as a whole. It might as well have been invisible, a momentary glint on the brass. We arent trying to destroy the barrier, he reminded himself. We need to pass through it. That is all.*  
*The flare of the blasts faded. Geysers of molten metal extended into the void. Burning gas dissipated. A crater as wide as the fleet appeared. It glowed from the heat of its creation.*  
*Our auspex readings put the depth of the breach at approximately four thousand miles, Guilliman said.*  
*It might as well be nothing at all, the Lion muttered, disgusted. The crater was a meaningless blemish on the barrier. The wall could be millions of miles thick. There was no return fire. The fleets did not even register as a threat for the things inside the fortifications.*

They later go through the Fortress' gate in search of its foundations, and they find a tiny planet inside the system\-sized Fortress which is serving as a nexus of Empyrean energies:

***Spoiler***\*:\*  
*There was a gate. It came into view as the fleets travelled towards the galactic east. As far as the Lion could tell, it ran the entire height of the wall. By this time, the peaks of the battlements were long out of sight. The gate extended above and below the Invincible Reasons position to the limits of perception, a universe of daemonic might. The fleets increased the angle of descent, heading for the promised base.*  
*For much of the journey, the gate seemed endless, but it had a design, and so the Lion knew it must end. It took a long time for him to make out the engraving in the middle of the portal. This close, it resembled a mountain chain, a topography as big as a thousand worlds pressed together. The mountains had lines, though. They were constructed, they were art, and so they had meaning. The Lion watched the portions of the design as it passed by the oculus. He held the fragmented visions in his head, and assembled the pieces into a whole. It was an eight\-pointed star. It was a brand upon the universe. It was a wound in reality, and it was a declaration of rule. As soon as the Lion understood its contours, it seemed to look back at him, an eye more monstrous and knowing than any of the red glows in the wall. It gazed at the dust motes of the fleet, and it looked upon the Lion from inside his mind.*  
*His lip curled in defiance. He focused on the progress of the Reasons journey. He promised the symbol destruction as he stared forwards. We will hurl you from the galaxy. By whatever means necessary.*  
*The gate and the star slid by. The pace was agonising, though the fleet moved at full speed. The heat bloom detected by the Blood Angels became more intense and more defined in the long\-range auspex scans. At last, its source became visible.*  
*Sanguinius, the Lion voxed, we have located your foundations.*  
*The eastern hinge of the gate was anchored to a world. As it came into sight, the planet was tiny, barely an excrescence at the bottom of the wall. But the intersection of gate and planet flared with enormous energy, far more than the disparity in size would suggest. The bloom originated in the planet, and travelled, spreading out a long way up the height and breadth of the gate before it faded.*  
*So pitiful a foundation for so immense a construct, said the Lion.*

As they approach the planet, they discover more about it. It is identified as the planet of Pyrrhan, and in it stands a mountain\-sized Manufactorum Forge from which the Warp\-energies are flowing:

***Spoiler***\*:\*  
*Sanguinius walked across the Red Tears bridge, taking in the portrait of the planet emerging from the combined rapid scans of the fleet as they developed on the arrays of auspex screens. It was a small, rocky world, not much larger than a planetoid, less than three thousand miles in diameter. Steep mountain chains dominated much of the south, diminishing as they approached the equator. Tens of thousands of years of intensive mining in the once\-inhabited northern hemisphere had worn the peaks down. The composite images of the north showed the traces of human civilisation and industry, now twisted almost past the point of recognition. Manufactoria taller than the mountains they had replaced belched fire and smoke into the worlds eternal night. A spiral pillar, five hundred miles wide, linked the north magnetic pole of Pyrrhan to the bottom of the gate. It emerged from the greatest manufactorum, a jagged monster that rose from the surrounding terrain like two gigantic, clawed hands clasped in prayer. There was no clear division between manufactorum and pillar. They flowed into one another, and the pillar flowed into the gate. The pillar shone with the light of molten matter.*  
*Sanguinius took what he saw with him to the hololith chamber. Matter, he said to the images of his brothers. Matter is being created at this juncture. We can observe it happening. The pillar grows from the manufactorum. The gates being is forged here.*  
*It cannot be the planets own matter, the Lion said. It is a speck compared to the gate. It would have been consumed a million times over by now.*  
*There is nothing about what we are seeing that is rational, said Guilliman. His jaw was set with frustration. He said rational with something like bereavement. This fortress is already impossible a million times over.*  
*Yet Pyrrhan is somehow necessary to it, Sanguinius pointed out. The impossible has attached itself to something real.*  
*Guillimans eyes widened in the hope of reason. An anchor, he said. The fortress needs to anchor itself in the materium. Maybe Pyrrhans industry, in the new configuration, is a gateway, funnelling in the warps substance, making it into stable matter.*  
*That conforms to what we are seeing, said Sanguinius. The intensity of the energy suggests an important nexus of some sort. Brothers, I would thrust a sword into that heart and sever the connection.*  
*Guilliman nodded. Destroy the forge. Shut down the flow of matter. Perhaps that might destabilise the gate.*

And so the Primarchs decide to invade the planet with their Legions to destroy the Forge, in hopes of destroying the Fortress. Naturally, both the Fortress' defenses and legions of Daemons try to stop them. After a long battle, they arrive on the Manufactorum. There, they feel a tremendous psychic power inside, welcoming them:

***Spoiler***\*:\*  
*The IX Legion moved at a brutal run between the doors, racing to get through before they shut with crushing finality. There was a mile of open floor between the doors and the tunnel mouths. The surface was metal, though it looked like knotted flesh. With the Sanguinary Guard as point again, Sanguinius crossed the threshold in the manufactorum and directed the phalanxes to the left and right.*  
*We take the widest halls, he ordered. One company in each path. Captains, choose your terrain to fight upon.*  
*What are we looking for? Raldoron asked.*  
*Well know when we find it, Sanguinius answered. Believe that this is still a manufactorum. We can destroy its ability to function without having to destroy the structure itself. Go now, for Baal, for Terra and the Emperor!*  
*He was running forwards as he spoke. His army was spreading out behind him, escaping the doors. He chose the central hall for the Sanguinary Guard and First Company. Halfway across the floor of the towering vestibule, Sanguinius looked back. The doors were almost closed. The last of the Blood Angels were inside. He could just see a narrow slit, flickering with the flames of the battle outside the manufactorum. Brothers, he voxed Guilliman and the Lion, we are inside.*  
*Well fought, said the Lion. We will scrape the land clear of the abominations for your extraction.*  
*Does the interior suggest how you can shut the forge down? Guilliman asked. I would think*  
*Vox contact with the exterior of the manufactorum cut off. The doors closed with a tectonic boom.*  
*As Sanguinius led the march to the central tunnel, to where daemons gibbered and snarled and chanted, a psychic shudder rippled through the immense forge. It passed over Sanguinius. It was the touch of malevolent sentience. It felt like a welcome.*

They walk through the Manufactorum's interior. The Forge is a living entity, with warp\-energy flowing through arterial conduits.

***Spoiler***\*:\*  
*The manufactorum breathed. It was metal and stone, a monstrosity constructed on a framework of brass and iron girders the size of cities that gave shape to the bones of the planet. It was a work built in the materium, of the materium, and yet it breathed. The taint of the warp oozed from every crack in the metal, every pore of stone. The floor beneath Sanguinius boots heaved up and down with the slow inhale and exhale of lungs. It slithered too. Footing was treacherous. The metal felt as if it were covered by a thick, viscous slick of ichor. It was not. It was dry. Serpentine tremors moved through it, shifting and pulling, the surface changing from rough to smooth in the space of an instant.*  
*The manufactorum bled. Where bolt shells or daemon claws struck the walls, rotting blood ran. The wounds puckered and sucked like hungry mouths.*  
*And the manufactorum sang. The conduits were the pipes of an organ. Whatever moved through them summoned notes of cancerous music. The deeper the Blood Angels ventured into the forge, the more complex the song became. The mouths of open conduits had teeth, and tongues lapped at their edges. They shaped themselves to the demands of the tune. The tongues vibrated. The octaves of the sick melody plunged so far beneath hearing, the vibrations would have shattered a mortals skeleton. They rose so high, Sanguinius tasted blood. The music was a polyphonic symphony of dark industry and darker intent. It was a hymn to ruin, and a threnody for hope. In the complex nodes that developed, he thought he heard the formation of a whisper. It was at the edge of perception, unwilling to declare itself yet. There were no syllables. It was the hesitation that came before a familiar word was pronounced.*  
*Sanguinius was not alone in hearing the whisper. Raldoron spoke to him when First Company and the Sanguinary Guard broke through another horde of the corpulent, plague\-bearing abominations. Something is speaking here.*  
*And it wants us to listen, Sanguinius said. Shut your ears to it. There will only be poison in the words.*

Sanguinius and his Legion reach the center of the Forge, and inside it they find the source of the psychic power that was welcoming them: A single Daemon, the one responsible for the Fortress' creation. As Sanguinius approaches to face him, he is hit with a blinding light of Warp\-energy:

***Spoiler***\*:\*  
*At last the corridor narrowed and made a sharp turn to the right. It ended in another nexus chamber. In the chamber was a single abomination; it stood before the junction of conduits. It was kin to the one Sanguinius and the herald had fought outside the manufactorum. It was taller, its horns longer, but the muscle\-pink of its hide was the same. It carried a staff instead of a sword, and this it held at the vertical. Its other two hands held a book. Sanguinius did not know if it was the same tome or not. He didnt care. The daemon appeared to want him to care. It held the book open. It held it forwards, arms extended, an invitation Sanguinius would decline.*  
*A nimbus of warp energy surrounded the daemon. It dissipated as the Blood Angels came into view. As the energy vanished, the sounds of the daemon army fell into silence. The illusion of the multitude evaporated.*  
*So this is our ambush, said Azkaellon. A single foe. He sounded very suspicious.*  
*Kano? Sanguinius asked. He advanced slowly into the chamber. Several hundred yards separated him from the daemon. He saw no other abominations lying in wait.*  
*I sense only the one we see, the Librarian voxed.*  
*Sanguinius hesitated. The daemon was motionless. It did not attack. It held the book, and that was all. It had lured him here. It must know what he planned to do. It could not think it would be enough to stop the entire company.*  
*His choices were few. He had come to destroy the nexus. That imperative had not changed.*  
*Sanguinius halted less than fifty feet into the chamber. He would not be part of the design being woven. Fire on the nerve cluster from this position, Sanguinius commanded. Ignore the daemon.*  
*The sorcerous light returned, and a sudden nova burst from the book. It shot up and behind the daemon, striking the nexus.*  
*Back! Sanguinius ordered.*  
*The conduits disintegrated. Coruscating, murderous light burst from them. It formed a contained ball of energy, blinding in intensity, its convulsions scraping at the mind like claws. It fused tighter, drawing in on itself. It imploded, and now, where the junction had been, was a single point of warp light.*  
*Oh, Sanguinius thought, and then the light came for him.*

Sanguinius and the Daemon have an incredible battle, where the Daemon attacks him on a physical, mental, and spiritual. Through sheer strength and will, Sanguinius is victorious. I will post the entirety of the fight here, because it is just too much awesome not too:

***Spoiler***\*:\*  
*There was a moment of absolute void and then there was a maelstrom of creation, an uncontrolled explosion of being without form. He dropped down its eye, into dark. He fell through blackness veined with red and green and blue and violet, the colours of ruin entwined and cutting into his mind like wire.*

*He did not land, but he stopped falling. He floated in the black. The darkness became mist, gathered definition, and became the bridge of the Vengeful Spirit. He was there again, as present as he had been when he had slipped between realities on the Red Tear. And again, Horus struck him down.*

*The pain again. The pain of final dissolution. He felt himself die, and he felt the grief at treachery and the grief of failure, the grief that his death was meaningless. There was no doubt now. He died, and Horus won, and that was all.*  
*He fell into the dark, and light pierced it again; it became shadows and then substance again, and once more Horus towered over him. Once more, Horus slew him.*  
*The pain, the grief, the futility It was all there again.*  
*And then again.*  
*And again.*  
*And again.*  
*He lived his final moment over and over. The pain never diminished. Each iteration of his doom was as excruciating as the last. He tried to turn his head as the Vengeful Spirit materialised. He was confronted with the same perspective. He groaned, and with a wrenching effort of will, he turned his back on Horus. He spun himself away from the vision, though he heard the sound of his boots against the deck.'*  
*The effort was futile. He turned and turned and turned, and he died and he died and he died. There was no escape, no meaning, no hope. Each time Horus killed him, he saw a trace of the future that would come. Every death brought its consequences. None were repeated. All were terrible. Horus was endlessly triumphant. All that changed was his immediate route to power.*  
*Sanguinius spun faster, the movement no longer of his volition, and he saw endless iterations of his fate at once, as if he were in a mirror corridor, with the same image reflected to infinity. But this was more than an image. It was real. He died a thousand times at once, and the pain was a thousand times amplified.*  
*A new blackness rose. This one was his. It came from within. It was anger that dwarfed the pain. Its jaws were immense, jagged with fangs, breathing flame and hatred. It consumed him, and yet the jaws were his too. With them, he would repay the treacherous galaxy with blood. He roared in an agony of wrath as the images of his death endlessly repeated. Darkness within lashed at the darkness without. Deep in his mind, buried in the agony, a sliver of his identity protested. It did not want this thing he had become. It rejected the black monster that claimed him as its father. His last piece of rationality reached out in desperation for any trace of hope. It flashed through the deaths upon deaths upon deaths, becoming weaker and dimmer as it looked for any meaning, any sign of doom leading to consequences other than eternal night for the Imperium.*  
*At last, the hope appeared. In the infinite variations of the battle against Horus, there was one that challenged predestined death. One vision was different. Only one. In it, Sanguinius dodged the death blow. Horus put so much power into it that he overbalanced when he missed. There was a fraction of a second of hesitation as he sought to correct his momentum. Sanguinius seized the chance, and drove the Blade Encarmine up. It found the weakened point in Horus gorget. It pierced his armour.*  
*It pierced his throat.*  
*It pierced his skull.*  
*This was the outcome Sanguinius had never even dreamed of, because the entire foundations of his destiny were built upon its denial. 'In this one vision, the terrible blackness withered, collapsed and broke apart into whirling ash. Here, and only here, there was hope. Here, and only here, the Imperium did not fall. Here, and only here, the Emperors dream lived on.*  
*Like the coils of a monstrous serpent, the continuum of dooms gathered around Sanguinius. They came to strangle the single hope. They came to destroy the thing that turned them from certainties into mere possibilities. The visions formed a knot around Sanguinius and the image of light. It tightened. The wrenching anger rose once more, fastening its grip on his being. When the knot closed, the light would be gone, and there would only be the fury.*  
*Sanguinius felt the imperative of decision. He made his choice. He refused the blackness and chose hope. He lunged towards the light. He raised his sword and plunged into the vision. He became the Sanguinius who slew Horus. The sword killed Horus, and it cut through his evil dream. It sliced through the knot. The visions fractured, mirrors broken into shards. They fell away into the void.*  
*Now Sanguinius was falling again, but he was not done with the sword. After driving the Blade Encarmine through Horus skull and through the knot of fate, he brought it down. There was so much strength in the blow, it cut through unreality itself.*  
*The blade sank into the flesh of the dream void. It tore the warp fabric open with fire. Light appeared beneath Sanguinius as he fell. He was leaving the realm of visions, but had not yet returned to reality. He was in a nether zone, neither dream nor real, but linked to both states. The light was another knot, another nexus. It looked like the intersection of the manufactorum conduits, only the conduits themselves were absent. It was the flow of warp energy and material mined from the interior of Pyrrhan, the unreal colliding with the solid to form the gate. Searing, impossible creation whirled through the convulsions of the nexus. It was the forge of the new reality of the galaxy. Sanguinius descended, wings outspread, to cleave the knot in two.*  
*He passed through the nexus. In his wake, creation ended. The energy screamed. The uncontrollable explosion spread though the void. A dome of conflagration unfurled above Sanguinius.*  
*Still he fell, still powered by the single sword blow. Another knot of energy appeared, and he cut it, and then the next, and the next, and the next. He had chosen to live, and so had torn destiny open, and with that rupture was slicing apart all the coils with which Chaos sought to entangle him. He was dealing a death blow to a creature he barely understood, whose size he could not grasp, and yet had defeated.*  
*Down, down, down, the great sword blow of hope cutting through all the knots of ruin, a streak of red unleashing the flames of purification, until he cut his way back to reality. The void peeled back. The light of deliverance engulfed him. It blinded him with the blood\-red fire. He blinked, and the flare vanished. He stood in the chamber from which he had first fallen. The daemon was at his feet. Its body was cut in two. As was its book and its staff. Weapons and corpse curled at the edges, dissolving from the materium. Violent light filled the chamber. A sea of liquid fire roiled across the ceiling. Currents of flame strove against each other. Maelstroms formed, melting everything above. Metal and stone dropped in blinding streams to the floor of the chamber. Everything was shaking, cracking, breaking apart.*

What he destroyed in the Warp is destroyed in the Material universe, and as a result of the Daemon and its power being slain, the whole Manufactorum begins to collapse:

***Spoiler***\*:\*  
*Lord Sanguinius? Azkaellon was at his side, half reaching as if unsure whether or not the Angel was an illusion.*  
*Sanguinius looked around, trying to get his bearings. He felt the solidity of the floor beneath his boots. The surface quaked, but did not flow away into dream. He looked at his sons. The Blood Angels were more or less as he had last seen them. More of the company had entered the chamber, but that was the only change in their disposition he could see. They were solid, unwavering in their reality. What happened? he asked.*  
*You vanished, said Azkaellon, alarmed.*  
*On the Red Tear, he had fought visions, but they had been visions. He had not fallen into an elsewhere. The fusion of dreams and reality made him dizzy. How long was I gone?*  
*A few seconds. You and the daemon.*  
*It had felt like hours. A lifetime. As long as death.*  
*His vox\-bead vibrated, erupting with the reports and interrogatives of his captains and Chapter Masters. He listened to them now, putting together what had happened during his absence. He realised after a few moments that he was the author of the new situation in the forge. What he had cut apart in that netherzone was now destroyed in reality. Tangles of conduits all over the manufactorum had exploded, far more than had been targeted. The complex trembled. Its song was broken beyond repair. The manufactorum screamed now. It howled a chorus of final pain and terror. Machines and power were tearing each other apart.*  
*In the hail of reports coming over the vox, a fragment broke through. It was a single word. Brother. The rest was lost in static. But the voice was Guillimans. The Blood Angels were no longer isolated from the other two Legions.*  
*The tremors were growing more violent by the second. The forges scream rose higher, losing coherence, becoming a thunder of catastrophe.*  
*We have triumphed! Sanguinius voxed to the Legion. The enemys works fall before us.*  
*At his nod, Azkaellon ordered, All forces, withdraw immediately.*  
*Spear held high, he led the turn away from the chamber. The tunnel beyond roared. Liquid flame consumed its ceiling too. The conduits split, bleeding energy. Uncanny lightning forked across the width of the corridor. It burned glowing crevasses into the walls and floor.*  
*The Blood Angels raced to keep their victory. The mountainous forge was about to fall in on itself.*  
*We do not die here, Sanguinius thought. My end is not yet.*  
*And then he wondered, Are you sure?*  
*He wasnt. And the uncertainty elated him.*

The Legions evacuate in time, and as they enter their ships, the **entire solar\-system sized Fortress collapses**:

***Spoiler***\*:\*  
*The end of the manufactorum arrived as the combined fleets came over the horizon, putting them once more in the line of fire of the keeps guns. The surface of Pyrrhan flared white. Coronas of warp energy whipped up the pillar, growing vaster with every slashing coil. Pyrrhan imploded, vanishing in an instant, the tiny growth at the end of the pillar sucked into the climbing disintegration. Blasts the size of miniature suns rocked the pillar, and then the dissolution reached the gate itself.*  
*The gun emplacements on the gate fired briefly. They did not destroy their targets before destruction came for them. On the bridge of the Red Tear, Sanguinius watched the holocaust. Warp\-infused flames hundreds of thousands of miles high consumed the gate. The structure lost coherence. It disintegrated. Shrapnel as big as planets spun away from the main body. Solid matter millions of miles thick became vortices, hurling streams of incandescent rubble into the void. The trailing edge of one stream hit the Dark Angels cruiser Claustro, turning the vessel to burning gas. The greatest vortex appeared in the middle of the gate. The eight\-pointed star spiralled into fragments. The breach spread wider with ferocious speed. The colossal structure consumed itself like burning parchment, the edges peeling away from the centre, ash that could smash a battleship to dust billowing to the galactic east and west. The sides of the ruined gate glowed, molten. Between them now was a passage millions of miles wide. The void, stained by the Ruinstorm, was visible on the other side.*  
*Engines powering up to maximum speed, the fleet began the long crossing between walls of infinite fire.*

***Spoiler***\*:\*  
*I was on the edge of dozing off when the earth shook. A commotion erupted around the table. I noticed everybody gazing at the map. It crawled and changed even as I watched. In the centre was still the huge angel\-topped hive of Irongrad. Around it were still the snaking cables of the great pipelines. There was something else, something new, something that reminded me of what I had seen on my way through Irongrad. The earth was splitting all around the hive. Lines of fire appeared.*  
*What is going on? Sejanus asked. Macharius looked at Drake.*  
*The ritual is nearing its climax. The tectonic plates of the world itself are shifting. The power of the Angel of Fire is manifesting.*  
*The wastelands were split by great fiery chasms. Lava bubbled forth, forming rivers and lakes. It looked as if a new lava sea was being born in front of us.*

Also the presence of the Daemon is so powerful it can be felt even by those with no psychic power:

***Spoiler***\*:\*  
*We knew we could take the hive. We had already done so once. That was not in doubt. What was in doubt was our ability to bridge the great moats of lava sliding into place around the city in time to stop the ritual. None of us wanted to contemplate what would happen if we were still on\-planet when the Angel of Fire manifested. One look at Drakes sickly features was enough to convince me that it was not likely to be a pleasant experience.*  
*There was a growing horror in the chamber. In part I suspect it was a product of the manifestation of the Angel. Even people with as much sensitivity to psychic events as a desert rock could sense that there was something wrong. There was a pressure in the air such as you get before a great storm. A cloud of gloom and despair had settled over our entire army. Macharius stared hard at the holo\-map. All of his attention was focused on it. He glared at it as if he believed his hope of rebirth in the Emperors Light depended on it. I suppose in a way it did. Concentrating, Macharius did not fidget. He merely stood there, statue\-still, looking completely at rest. His gaze was fixed unwaveringly on the map, on the great hive that it was his desire to reclaim. A cold light burned in his eyes. It was as if he was staring at some hated personal enemy.*

The shadow of the Daemon's power is reshaping the entire planet's surface:

***Spoiler***\*:\*  
*It seemed that we were insignificant to whatever power was manifesting itself in Irongrad. It was not creating a flaming barrier to keep us out, except perhaps by accident. It was manifesting a tribute to its own glory and might, reshaping the desert and the earth and the elements of rock and fire into a pattern that was significant only to it.*  
*Its very close to the sign of Tzeentch, said Drake. The Changer of Ways. Its obvious now that you point it out.*  
*His voice was so soft it was hard to pick out the words. I think he was speaking only to himself. Nonetheless a chill passed through the room. An eerie silence fell. The inquisitor had named one of those names that it is very ill to speak, one of the greatest of all the enemies of humanity. Anton gave out a soft yelp. I understood why. Was it possible that this great daemon\-god was going to manifest on the surface of Karsk? If it did, what would happen then? Even the shadow of its power was already beginning to reshape the land. Once it was fully present, what would it not be capable of?*

More info on the world being warped:

***Spoiler***\*:\*  
*We swept forwards and I could see the lava flows clearly. Jets of liquid stone spurted upwards, incandescent and ruby red. The earth was cracking. Occasionally, the Baneblade shifted oddly in response to the moving ground. It felt like it might spin out of control if I was not careful. I watched all of the volt gauges and meters carefully. I kept my hands ready on the controls. I did not want to be taken off\-guard by anything. We followed the paths predetermined by Machariuss discovery. It reminded me of our first approach to Irongrad. It was just as tricky and we did not have time to take things slowly and carefully.*  
*The formation rolled on, feeling its way forwards through the shifting terrain where the sign of the daemon\-god was being written on the living flesh of the world. It was slow progress and it became all the slower when the heretics realised what was happening. Not all of them were wrapped up in their ritual summoning. The great batteries on the armoured skin of the city opened fire. Swarms of flyers engaged our air\-cover in battle. Within the city itself I had no doubt troops were being marshalled.*  
*As we got closer to the city, following the channels of the infernal symbol surrounding the hive, the earth tremors became more intense and the air seemed to shimmer and pulse. Whirlpools of multi\-coloured light swirled in the air. At first I thought it was some sort of heat haze. Rocks split and tanks were swallowed like men going down in jungle quicksand. That was not the worst of it.*  
*Out of those swirling whirlpools creatures were starting to emerge. They were roughly humanoid in shape, but their outlines seemed to shimmer and shift as much as the whirlpools that spawned them. They were an odd shade of pink and they belched flame from numerous orifices that seemed to appear in their skin, like blowholes bubbling out of a mudpool. There was something awful just in their very appearance. At times they seemed as if they were not quite solid, not quite there, as insubstantial as a heat\-haze or a fever dream. At other times they looked somehow more solid than a tank. They shimmered and were gone only to reappear a few strides away from where they had been. They opened mouths as wide as their entire bodies, revealing fangs the size of bayonets and roared challenges as they threw themselves at our fighting vehicles.*

The laws of reality are breaking down under the Daemon's power:

***Spoiler***\*:\*  
*I heard Drake grunt behind me. I avoided turning to look at him, but I could not ignore his muttering voice. The power is spiking. What new horror is this?*  
*Looking out through the drive periscope I saw at once what he meant. The statues were coming to life. It sounds absurd when I say it now, but that is exactly what was happening. All of those fire\-winged metal angels were starting to stretch and flex, like men waking from long sleep. I knew then that something truly unnatural was really happening in Irongrad. When statues come to life, stretch out clawed fingers and take to the air on wings of plasma fire, you know that natural law has been suspended. They soared above the burning buildings and seemed to draw strength from the blaze.*  
*Judging from the screams echoing through the streets around me, I was not alone in my realisation. It looked like the citizens of Irongrad were starting to wake up to the truth of what the materialisation of their deity might bring. It was a miracle of sorts but it was a dark and unholy one. Statues should not come to life. They should remain decently posed and immobile. They should not twist and gesture. Most of all they should not sing. From all of the angels came a full\-throated hymn of triumph, at once joyous and evil, strangely thrilling and terribly ominous. The sound did not seem loud within the hull of the Baneblade but the fact that it could be heard at all was troubling. We were supposed to be warded from the siren song of Chaos.*  
*The living statues swooped over us, stretching out their hands and sending bolts of flame arcing down. They splattered off the side of the Baneblade. A strange aroma of brimstone and something else, not unpleasant but haunting and odd was detectable even within the tank. I assumed this must be an actual smell, working through the filters, not something supernatural.*  
*We must hurry, said Drake. The daemon\-god is almost through. Its power is starting to manifest and reality is starting to warp under the force of its power.*

Inquisitor Drake's report on the Daemon:

***Spoiler***\*:\*  
*It is far, far worse even than I had thought it was going to be. The forces of the Architect of Fate have manifested themselves on the surface of this world. The thin skin of mortal reality has broken and that which lurks beneath has become visible. I am making these notes in what may prove to be the final moments of my life in the hope that they may be found and benefit the Imperial force that comes after us.*  
*\(...\)*  
*The skies swirl with daemons but that is nothing to what only a psyker can perceive. The sky above the hive is splitting. A great fissure in reality is opening. Something dark and terrible and majestic is moving through. I pray that we are in time.*

Implication that the Angel of Fire is more powerful than a Warlord Titan:

***Spoiler***\*:\*  
*We piled out of the hatches and swarmed down the sides of the Baneblade. Even that enormous, ancient presence seemed dwarfed by the cathedral.*  
*The air smelled of brimstone and incense and a scent I remembered well from the factorum\-foundries of my youth: molten metal. A strange light glowed around everything. Our surroundings looked too bright, but sometimes shadows that should not have been there rippled across walls, as if cast by something huge moving against a light which had no source in our world. It was eerie, unnatural and disturbing. Sometimes the shadow of the Horrors was visible as if they were just about to manifest.*  
*Over everything was an oppressive sense of the imminence of something supernatural. I felt like I was in the presence of something greater than human, much greater. I was reminded of the moment when I had confronted the Titan in the rubble of the factorum but this was a thousand times worse. The ancient warmachine had been a being compared to which I was an insect. To the thing manifesting itself now, I was a microbe.*

Description of the Angel of Fire entering Realspace for good:

***Spoiler***\*:\*  
*Ahead of us were massed ranks of priests chanting and singing their awful hymn. In front of them stood their High Priest, the focus of the whole devilish ritual. It was not he who commanded our sight though. It was the Angel. It had already manifested under the vast vaulted roof. The hanging banners already smoked and burned in contact with its burning wings. Around it everything seemed to shimmer.*  
*It towered above us, seemingly a hundred times the height of a man. It looked bigger, as if something infinite were compressing itself into the tiny space available in our world. It came from somewhere else where its size had no limit or meaning. In my mind I imagined it larger than a planet, able to hold a whole world in its beautiful clawed hand. Its skin was the colour of bronze. Its robe was shimmering white. Its face was beautiful. Its eyes were filled with fire. Its wings billowed from its back in a cloud of gaseous plasma. It seemed immense but not yet solid. All of the flames in the temple twisted towards it, dancing worshippers genuflecting to their god.*  
*It looked down on us and it smiled.*  
*I felt as if it was looking directly at me. I am sure every man there did. It is a discomforting thing to come under the gaze of a great daemon. It was looking into my soul, seeing my darkest secrets, measuring every particle of sin. It knew me in a moment better than I knew myself. It knew all the dark and hateful things I wanted to keep hidden even from myself. It recognised me as one of its own. It made a beckoning gesture with its hand. There was an awful invitation in the movement. It called upon me to step forwards, to join it, to be purged by its cleansing flame and renewed.*  
*There was a promise of immortality in that gesture and the fulfilment of all my dreams. I could walk forwards and join the ranks of its followers and become one with the immortals. I could welcome the presence of this tremendous cosmic being into my life and become part of its legion of worshippers and leave this place and conquer worlds in its name.*  
*Visions of an eternity of splendour danced before me. I would be ruler of a world, many worlds. My enemies would fear me. Women would adore me. I would be greater than any king. I watched transfixed. I think it was curiosity that saved my soul, strange as that may sound.*  
*For some reason I looked at Macharius, perhaps even then seeking to follow his lead. He stood transfixed. His eyes were locked on the daemonic Angel. There seemed to be some sort of direct communication going on between them. I wondered what he was seeing, what temptations were being placed before him. I was being presented to myself as a conqueror of worlds. He was already all of that and more.*  
*What could it offer him?*

Macharius Vs Incomplete Angel of Fire. While not fully manifested, the Greater Daemon should still scale to the effects its mere summoning was causing. Easily a Planetary threat.

***Spoiler***\*:\*  
*The swirling essence of the daemon descended upon the corpse of the High Priest. The body slowly rose, one eye dangling from an optic nerve torn from its exposed skull. The other was filled with fire. Great flaming wings emerged from his back, a sword of fire appeared in his hands. His ruined corpse had become the vessel of the Angel. Some of the sense of terrible presence was gone.*  
*It has not fully manifested, Drake shouted. It cannot draw on its full power. We can still overcome it.*  
*I was not sure I believed him.*  
*The corpse advanced towards us. The flesh of the right cheek had been ripped away to expose grinning teeth. It looked evil and terrible and filled with awful wrath. Macharius raced to meet it, chainsword screaming in his hand. The daemon parried the blow with its weapon. It seemed impossible something so insubstantial could parry a weapon as solid as a chainsword but it did. It struck back, blade flickering forwards impossibly fast, a line of fire searing Machariuss cheek.*  
*Drake and his psykers started to chant then. A glow surrounded Macharius, of the sort you see depicted in religious paintings of the Emperor and his primarchs. It was the first time I had ever seen it in reality. I swear a halo of light had appeared around Machariuss head. He looked like a saint made flesh, which was in its way reassuring; to survive this we were going to need the assistance of a saint and more even than that.*  
*Macharius fought with the Angel of Fire. I thought I heard something over the roar of battle and the chant of plainsong. I realised it was Drake. He was shouting: Kill the priests!*  
*We waded in among the heretics, stabbing and bludgeoning and shooting. I have never considered it honourable to murder unarmed men but in this case I was prepared to make an exception. The priests screamed and died. The air where the Angel had been swirled; looking up I saw what appeared to be a hole in the fabric of our reality, a gateway to somewhere else, to whatever distant, Chaotic realm the Angel had come from.*  
*All I seemed to see were swirling colours, flames dancing in all manner of strange patterns and bearing a resemblance to whatever real\-world objects my mind projected on to them. They took on shape, like those castles you sometimes see when staring into a fire. I saw molten landscapes over which rose citadels sculpted from flame and around which fluttered hosts of fire\-winged angels. They were assembling themselves into disciplined regiments and preparing to jump the gap to our world.*  
*I tore my gaze away from that portal into an alternative reality and I saw that Macharius was still engaged in hand\-to\-hand combat with the avatar of the Angel of Fire. As ever, he moved with blazing quickness. His motion was a blur, too fast to be followed easily with the human eye. It did not appear as if the daemon had any trouble doing so.*  
*The Angel parried Machariuss blade with its sword of fire. If anything, its attacks were even faster than the generals. I was surprised that anything could live when faced by the full fury of its onslaught.* *:Every time that fiery blade licked out it seemed to impact upon the generals armour. And yet, Macharius did not burn. It took me some time to realise why. He was being protected by the power of our own psykers.*  
*As ever, Macharius had a very sound grasp of the situation. Of course, in all likelihood, he knew no more about how to deal with it than I did. On the other hand, he knew that there was someone present who did.*  
*Close that infernal portal before it is too late. Drake heard and obeyed.*  
*Lines of light began to emerge from all of the Imperial psykers and converge upon the stalwart figure of the inquisitor. He did something with all that power, channelling it into a mesh of potent energy that swirled outwards from his hands and surrounded the glowing gate. He began to pull the net tight. The opening started to close but not without resistance.*  
*Men screamed and I wondered what was happening because there was a note in the screams that I had never heard before. The psykers around Drake started to fall, their mouths open, their faces pale, blood gushing from mouths and nostrils and eye\-sockets. It was not the same sound as the heretics made as they were slaughtered, it was something else, the sound of men who were losing their very souls, having them drawn from their bodies and offered up as a sacrifice to something greater.*  
*Beams of light emerged from Drakes hand and surged around the gateway, forming a lattice around it. His whole body was lit by the energies he wielded. His eyes blazed with the Emperors Light. Every one of the people who still communed with Drake stood frozen. Their eyes were wide, their mouths stretched in ghastly rictuses as if screams were being torn from their very souls. One by one, they toppled and died as if their life force was being wrenched from them and used to power whatever exorcism Drake performed.*  
*The daemon began to oppose the inquisitors efforts and tried to get past Macharius in order to cut him down with its fiery blade. Macharius kept himself interposed. He stood between it and Drake. Seeing the Lord High Commander at risk, more and more of our soldiers pressed forwards. The Angel chopped down but it could not find a way through that wall of flesh that opposed it. What human courage and human muscle could achieve our soldiers did. They wanted to protect Macharius even at the cost of their own lives. They threw themselves forwards, again and again forming a rampart of blood and gristle. I saw Anton and Ivan struggle to get forwards. They were almost within striking distance of the Angel when I lost sight of them in the press.*  
*I sensed the change in the atmosphere around us. Where once there was a wind of power blowing outwards into our world, now it felt as if the current was flowing in a different direction. All of the fire and energy seemed to be being sucked out of the air around us and returned to the place from which it had come, and as it did so I could see that the Angel of Fire was being drawn back into its own fiery realm. It fought every step of the way but, at last, it passed through the portal and that eerie gateway swirled shut.*  
*And then suddenly, it was silent. The Angel of Fire was gone.*",2018-05-30 01:08:39

I also have the redd, but i use it in conjunction with a parametric\-eq in\-order to properly shape the low end more like an actual redd \(without any of the band\-pass effect the beatles used\). So unless you use the exact same settings i have, or you really want that ""drive"" setting on the 73\(which is controlled by the input gain\), probably stick with the tg12345. if you are thinking about vintage compressors, the native instruments vintage compressors 3 pack is probably the best deal\(the vc2a and vc76 are fairly excellent\).

560,"I'm glad you're here to tell us about it!

>If anyone knows what caused it, please do tell.

My utterly uneducated guess is that it's your body telling you that your heart is having trouble beating. In my limited experiences with heart conditions \(atrial flutter for a few months, and the acute pericarditis\) there is a VERY distinct feeling associated with heart beat/rate  issues. Did your condition involve your heart? Did your heart rate plummet because of some other reason like blood loss?

I had the ""impending doom"" feeling too.

I was right, and got to the ER with probably only a short while to spare.

Prior to all this going down I'd felt increasingly like shit all evening long, but as the night progressed I got the *IMPENDING DOOM* feeling from my body. Then pain started to radiate down the inside of my arm. Aha, I thought. I'm having a fucking heart attack. Got to the ER and by that point the fucking impending doom signal was blaring in my mind.

We're talking something totally separate from terror. Because I was also terrified, and the impending doom thing was completely separate and distinct. I was wrong about the heart attack, by the way. It was acute pericarditis, which can present with essentially the same symptoms and can kill you just as dead.

>and there was definitely a very distinct feeling. I felt worse and  worse, until there was a sudden feeling of utter calmness and an  absolute certainty that I was going to die

I was pretty much the opposite of calm.

But I absolutely knew I was about to die without an immediate medical intervention. Luckily I was able to get to the ER, blurt out the symptoms to the ER nurse in a lucid way, and I guess they also noticed my lips were turning blue, and they rushed me into the ER and saved me.",2018-05-30 03:01:55

Just a taste of the quotes below.

Fear to Tread said:

>*And the same report from several others now The tinny mutter of overlapping communications signals was audible from the brassy pod. She held it away, trying to compose herself as best a woman could when she had such news to impart. Primarch, the captain of the Chalice and several picket ships around the edges of the flotilla are reporting the occurrence of an unusual astronomical phenomenon.*  
*Sanguinius turned back to the great portal and peered out, past the fires of ruined Phorus. Azkaellon came closer, and as he did he heard the Angel release a gasp.*  
*Sanguinius pointed, raising his gauntlet to the void. There. Do you see it?*  
*The Guard Commander grimaced as he looked; then he too felt his breath catch in his throat.* ***The stars***  
***Beyond the baleful red glow of Signus Alpha and the shimmers of its sister suns, the scattering of stars and nebulae that lay within sight of the Red Tear were changing. Azkaellon had the sudden impression of a colossal curtain falling across a stage the size of a galaxy. A great veil, impenetrable and Stygian, blotting out everything.***  
***Struck silent, he stood at the Angels side and watched the stars go out.***  
*\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_*  
*The Sanguinary Guard produced a data\-slate and read aloud from it.* ***This is from the fleet log. Picket ships among the sternguard wings report that an opaque mass resembling a black cloud has formed, six\-point\-three light days beyond the designated outer marker of the Signus Cluster. Long\-range optical observations in all directions appear to support the conclusion that this mass has completely shrouded the system.***  
*Is it some form of displacement? said Galan. There are stories of worlds falling wholesale into the immaterium after catastrophic warp space events. Could that happen to an entire star system, and to us along with it?*  
***Nearby, Metriculus stroked his chin, dismissing the question. The energy to achieve such a result would likely be greater than the sum total output of the galaxy itself. It is irrational to conceive it.***  
*Are these rational times? Redknifes reply was almost a whisper.*  
*The primarch shook his head slowly. We remain in normal space, Captain Galan. Our Navigators confirm this to us, although they report that they have lost all contact with warp beacons beyond the line of the veil.*  
*Chronometrics have been affected, Zuriel reported, and so too have our communications. Vox\-signals directed into the cloud mass are reflected back. The astropaths... He hesitated, shooting the Angel a look before continuing. An astropath aboard the Ignis attempted to make a sending through the barrier. He claimed he was assailed by screaming, maddened echoes of his own telepathic voice.*

Masque of Slaanesh causes the planets of a solar system to move by dancing, causing their orbits to shift and accompany the moving of her arms and legs and body, and making them align in a Slaaneshi symbol. And then she causes the system's sun to go supernova by warping her Daemon Palace\-thing into a dagger and having it pierce the star's heart.

They encounter a **Solar\-System sized space fortress** blocking their way. The fortress has its own gravitational pull that attracts them even though they are millions of miles away, and they quickly realize that the Fortress is impossible:

***Spoiler***\*:\*  
*The Invincible Reason plunged towards the wall of an impossible fortress. The Lion stared at the vision, and for several seconds his mind was unable to reconcile the structure with its size. It would have inspired awe had he seen it from the cockpit of a Thunderhawk. From the bridge of a ship, it beggared belief. He looked upon twisted, spiked battlements and towers of brass and iron. They rose from a wall that stretched to port and starboard as far as the Lion could see. The wall bristled with what, from this distance, looked like thorns and claws. The glow of ugly fires shone from innumerable apertures, a galaxy of pinprick flames. Light the colour of blood and hate moved over the fortifications, a nebula of horror.*  
*The fortress filled the oculus, the wall dropping beyond the frame. There was nothing to see except the battlements, nothing to give the structure scale, but at last the Lion grasped its full monstrosity. The fortress spanned a system. The wall was tens of millions of miles high. It was billions of miles long. And though the proximity was lethal, it was still millions of miles away.*  
*The fleets were caught in its gravitational well. They sailed across the void before it, pulled towards a collision, minute specks of dust blown at a mountainside.*  
*Hard to starboard, Captain Stenius ordered. In his command throne one level below the Lions position, he leaned forwards, pulling at the mechadendrites that linked him to the Invincible Reason, as if he could lend the ship greater mobility by the actions of his body.*  
*The Lion opened a fleet\-wide vox\-channel, and heard the same command echoing and re\-echoing. It was too late to attempt to reverse away from the fortress. But the ships might yet avoid disaster by taking the momentum into a turn, moving parallel to the barrier using a slingshot manoeuvre to break the walls grip. The Lion shifted his attention back and forth between the monster growing larger in the oculus, and the trajectory screens for the combined fleets. The lines were shifting, slowly. The fortress was coming closer, quickly. The prow of the Reason shuddered before the Lions gaze, mile upon mile of gothic majesty wrenched by forces that reduced it to insignificance.*  
*Hails from the Red Tear and the Samothrace, said the vox\-officer.*  
*Private channel, the Lion said. His brothers wished to speak to him. As he had expected they would.*  
*Where have you brought us? Guilliman demanded.*  
*I dont know, Roboute.*  
*Neither do I. We cant identify the system, whatever it once was.*  
*If this is a system, it has been moved, Sanguinius said. But the location is not as important as its nature. This is not the work of Horus. It cannot be the work of material hands, be they human or xenos.*

The Fortress has War\-Horns the size of Gas Giants, which emit waves of sound that cross the millions of miles between it and the Primarchs' fleet nearly instantly. The laws of physics have little meaning inside the Ruinstorm:

***Spoiler***\*:\*  
*The Lion turned back to the oculus. The angle of the Invincible Reasons approach had become oblique, though the fortress was so vast, its expanse stretched for an eternity into the void, glowing and pulsing with its unnatural fire. Conical shapes jutted out from the battlements at irregular intervals. They were the size of gas giants. They could not be what they appeared to be.*  
*Sanguinius confirmed the madness.Theyre war\-horns, he said. His tone was flat, and leaden with prophecy.*  
*The horns blared a challenge. Across the airless void, they made their terrible, warp\-created sound. It travelled the millions of miles that separated the fleet from the fortress. Perhaps the cry had come as soon as the fleets had been detected and it was only now reaching the ships. Perhaps the horns had only sounded on the instant. The laws of reality had been suspended in this star system, and the Lion knew that what mattered was not how the horns cried, but that they did. The sound smashed into the Invincible Reason, shaking the hull. It boomed through the bridge. It was deep, as deep as the heartbeat of mountains. And it was a wail, a rising, shrieking, raging wail that harrowed the soul. The Lion winced. He made himself breathe through the blast. He leaned into it. On the bridge below, officers screamed, blood running from their ears and eyes. Servitors collapsed, spines ground to powder. The electrical systems of the ship surged and stuttered, blowing out pict screens, setting control stations ablaze. The thrum of the battleships engines became a hammering roar, yet the cry of the horns sounded above everything.*

In desperation, the Primarchs command the entire fleet to shoot at the Fortress, hoping they can burst a path through it. They vaporize enough metal to create a crater as wide of the whole fleet and four thousand miles deep. It does nothing:

***Spoiler***\*:\*  
*Do any of us think we can destroy it? the Lion asked.*  
*We are all agreed that we must try, said Guilliman.*  
*The greatest single naval barrage in human history occurred less than an hour later. Hulls vibrating from the strain of engines pushing back against the pull of the fortress, the formation closed to firing range with the construct. The wall filled the oculus of the Invincible Reason completely. The Lion could see nothing but the iron, the brass, the flames and the thorns resolving themselves into guns taller than Olympus Mons.*  
*The weapons systems of the Imperium powered up. When they were ready, when the synchronisation of fire was arranged, when the speed of torpedoes was calculated against the immediacy of lances, so that every hit would strike the wall at the same moment, then the Lion, in concert with his brothers, said, Fire.*  
*Fire.*  
*The fire came to burn the void. More than a hundred ships opened up with every weapon. Macro\-cannon batteries, ranks of lances, nova cannons, cyclonic torpedoes and more unleashed the anger of humanity against the obscenity before them. The raging of the Ruinstorm faded before the searing light of purest, purging destruction. It was an act of war on a scale that had never been witnessed before. If there had been remembrancers aboard any of the vessels, they would have felt compelled to record an event so monumental in song and in verse.*  
*The barrage struck the fortress, and then it did not matter that there were no remembrancers. The action would not be remembered. There would be no songs. The immense became the insignificant. The explosions that erupted on the face of the battlements lit up the view in the Invincible Reasons oculus. But the Lion made the mental adjustment, and understood how tiny the site of the impact was in relation to the wall as a whole. It might as well have been invisible, a momentary glint on the brass. We arent trying to destroy the barrier, he reminded himself. We need to pass through it. That is all.*  
*The flare of the blasts faded. Geysers of molten metal extended into the void. Burning gas dissipated. A crater as wide as the fleet appeared. It glowed from the heat of its creation.*  
*Our auspex readings put the depth of the breach at approximately four thousand miles, Guilliman said.*  
*It might as well be nothing at all, the Lion muttered, disgusted. The crater was a meaningless blemish on the barrier. The wall could be millions of miles thick. There was no return fire. The fleets did not even register as a threat for the things inside the fortifications.*

They later go through the Fortress' gate in search of its foundations, and they find a tiny planet inside the system\-sized Fortress which is serving as a nexus of Empyrean energies:

***Spoiler***\*:\*  
*There was a gate. It came into view as the fleets travelled towards the galactic east. As far as the Lion could tell, it ran the entire height of the wall. By this time, the peaks of the battlements were long out of sight. The gate extended above and below the Invincible Reasons position to the limits of perception, a universe of daemonic might. The fleets increased the angle of descent, heading for the promised base.*  
*For much of the journey, the gate seemed endless, but it had a design, and so the Lion knew it must end. It took a long time for him to make out the engraving in the middle of the portal. This close, it resembled a mountain chain, a topography as big as a thousand worlds pressed together. The mountains had lines, though. They were constructed, they were art, and so they had meaning. The Lion watched the portions of the design as it passed by the oculus. He held the fragmented visions in his head, and assembled the pieces into a whole. It was an eight\-pointed star. It was a brand upon the universe. It was a wound in reality, and it was a declaration of rule. As soon as the Lion understood its contours, it seemed to look back at him, an eye more monstrous and knowing than any of the red glows in the wall. It gazed at the dust motes of the fleet, and it looked upon the Lion from inside his mind.*  
*His lip curled in defiance. He focused on the progress of the Reasons journey. He promised the symbol destruction as he stared forwards. We will hurl you from the galaxy. By whatever means necessary.*  
*The gate and the star slid by. The pace was agonising, though the fleet moved at full speed. The heat bloom detected by the Blood Angels became more intense and more defined in the long\-range auspex scans. At last, its source became visible.*  
*Sanguinius, the Lion voxed, we have located your foundations.*  
*The eastern hinge of the gate was anchored to a world. As it came into sight, the planet was tiny, barely an excrescence at the bottom of the wall. But the intersection of gate and planet flared with enormous energy, far more than the disparity in size would suggest. The bloom originated in the planet, and travelled, spreading out a long way up the height and breadth of the gate before it faded.*  
*So pitiful a foundation for so immense a construct, said the Lion.*

As they approach the planet, they discover more about it. It is identified as the planet of Pyrrhan, and in it stands a mountain\-sized Manufactorum Forge from which the Warp\-energies are flowing:

***Spoiler***\*:\*  
*Sanguinius walked across the Red Tears bridge, taking in the portrait of the planet emerging from the combined rapid scans of the fleet as they developed on the arrays of auspex screens. It was a small, rocky world, not much larger than a planetoid, less than three thousand miles in diameter. Steep mountain chains dominated much of the south, diminishing as they approached the equator. Tens of thousands of years of intensive mining in the once\-inhabited northern hemisphere had worn the peaks down. The composite images of the north showed the traces of human civilisation and industry, now twisted almost past the point of recognition. Manufactoria taller than the mountains they had replaced belched fire and smoke into the worlds eternal night. A spiral pillar, five hundred miles wide, linked the north magnetic pole of Pyrrhan to the bottom of the gate. It emerged from the greatest manufactorum, a jagged monster that rose from the surrounding terrain like two gigantic, clawed hands clasped in prayer. There was no clear division between manufactorum and pillar. They flowed into one another, and the pillar flowed into the gate. The pillar shone with the light of molten matter.*  
*Sanguinius took what he saw with him to the hololith chamber. Matter, he said to the images of his brothers. Matter is being created at this juncture. We can observe it happening. The pillar grows from the manufactorum. The gates being is forged here.*  
*It cannot be the planets own matter, the Lion said. It is a speck compared to the gate. It would have been consumed a million times over by now.*  
*There is nothing about what we are seeing that is rational, said Guilliman. His jaw was set with frustration. He said rational with something like bereavement. This fortress is already impossible a million times over.*  
*Yet Pyrrhan is somehow necessary to it, Sanguinius pointed out. The impossible has attached itself to something real.*  
*Guillimans eyes widened in the hope of reason. An anchor, he said. The fortress needs to anchor itself in the materium. Maybe Pyrrhans industry, in the new configuration, is a gateway, funnelling in the warps substance, making it into stable matter.*  
*That conforms to what we are seeing, said Sanguinius. The intensity of the energy suggests an important nexus of some sort. Brothers, I would thrust a sword into that heart and sever the connection.*  
*Guilliman nodded. Destroy the forge. Shut down the flow of matter. Perhaps that might destabilise the gate.*

And so the Primarchs decide to invade the planet with their Legions to destroy the Forge, in hopes of destroying the Fortress. Naturally, both the Fortress' defenses and legions of Daemons try to stop them. After a long battle, they arrive on the Manufactorum. There, they feel a tremendous psychic power inside, welcoming them:

***Spoiler***\*:\*  
*The IX Legion moved at a brutal run between the doors, racing to get through before they shut with crushing finality. There was a mile of open floor between the doors and the tunnel mouths. The surface was metal, though it looked like knotted flesh. With the Sanguinary Guard as point again, Sanguinius crossed the threshold in the manufactorum and directed the phalanxes to the left and right.*  
*We take the widest halls, he ordered. One company in each path. Captains, choose your terrain to fight upon.*  
*What are we looking for? Raldoron asked.*  
*Well know when we find it, Sanguinius answered. Believe that this is still a manufactorum. We can destroy its ability to function without having to destroy the structure itself. Go now, for Baal, for Terra and the Emperor!*  
*He was running forwards as he spoke. His army was spreading out behind him, escaping the doors. He chose the central hall for the Sanguinary Guard and First Company. Halfway across the floor of the towering vestibule, Sanguinius looked back. The doors were almost closed. The last of the Blood Angels were inside. He could just see a narrow slit, flickering with the flames of the battle outside the manufactorum. Brothers, he voxed Guilliman and the Lion, we are inside.*  
*Well fought, said the Lion. We will scrape the land clear of the abominations for your extraction.*  
*Does the interior suggest how you can shut the forge down? Guilliman asked. I would think*  
*Vox contact with the exterior of the manufactorum cut off. The doors closed with a tectonic boom.*  
*As Sanguinius led the march to the central tunnel, to where daemons gibbered and snarled and chanted, a psychic shudder rippled through the immense forge. It passed over Sanguinius. It was the touch of malevolent sentience. It felt like a welcome.*

They walk through the Manufactorum's interior. The Forge is a living entity, with warp\-energy flowing through arterial conduits.

***Spoiler***\*:\*  
*The manufactorum breathed. It was metal and stone, a monstrosity constructed on a framework of brass and iron girders the size of cities that gave shape to the bones of the planet. It was a work built in the materium, of the materium, and yet it breathed. The taint of the warp oozed from every crack in the metal, every pore of stone. The floor beneath Sanguinius boots heaved up and down with the slow inhale and exhale of lungs. It slithered too. Footing was treacherous. The metal felt as if it were covered by a thick, viscous slick of ichor. It was not. It was dry. Serpentine tremors moved through it, shifting and pulling, the surface changing from rough to smooth in the space of an instant.*  
*The manufactorum bled. Where bolt shells or daemon claws struck the walls, rotting blood ran. The wounds puckered and sucked like hungry mouths.*  
*And the manufactorum sang. The conduits were the pipes of an organ. Whatever moved through them summoned notes of cancerous music. The deeper the Blood Angels ventured into the forge, the more complex the song became. The mouths of open conduits had teeth, and tongues lapped at their edges. They shaped themselves to the demands of the tune. The tongues vibrated. The octaves of the sick melody plunged so far beneath hearing, the vibrations would have shattered a mortals skeleton. They rose so high, Sanguinius tasted blood. The music was a polyphonic symphony of dark industry and darker intent. It was a hymn to ruin, and a threnody for hope. In the complex nodes that developed, he thought he heard the formation of a whisper. It was at the edge of perception, unwilling to declare itself yet. There were no syllables. It was the hesitation that came before a familiar word was pronounced.*  
*Sanguinius was not alone in hearing the whisper. Raldoron spoke to him when First Company and the Sanguinary Guard broke through another horde of the corpulent, plague\-bearing abominations. Something is speaking here.*  
*And it wants us to listen, Sanguinius said. Shut your ears to it. There will only be poison in the words.*

Sanguinius and his Legion reach the center of the Forge, and inside it they find the source of the psychic power that was welcoming them: A single Daemon, the one responsible for the Fortress' creation. As Sanguinius approaches to face him, he is hit with a blinding light of Warp\-energy:

***Spoiler***\*:\*  
*At last the corridor narrowed and made a sharp turn to the right. It ended in another nexus chamber. In the chamber was a single abomination; it stood before the junction of conduits. It was kin to the one Sanguinius and the herald had fought outside the manufactorum. It was taller, its horns longer, but the muscle\-pink of its hide was the same. It carried a staff instead of a sword, and this it held at the vertical. Its other two hands held a book. Sanguinius did not know if it was the same tome or not. He didnt care. The daemon appeared to want him to care. It held the book open. It held it forwards, arms extended, an invitation Sanguinius would decline.*  
*A nimbus of warp energy surrounded the daemon. It dissipated as the Blood Angels came into view. As the energy vanished, the sounds of the daemon army fell into silence. The illusion of the multitude evaporated.*  
*So this is our ambush, said Azkaellon. A single foe. He sounded very suspicious.*  
*Kano? Sanguinius asked. He advanced slowly into the chamber. Several hundred yards separated him from the daemon. He saw no other abominations lying in wait.*  
*I sense only the one we see, the Librarian voxed.*  
*Sanguinius hesitated. The daemon was motionless. It did not attack. It held the book, and that was all. It had lured him here. It must know what he planned to do. It could not think it would be enough to stop the entire company.*  
*His choices were few. He had come to destroy the nexus. That imperative had not changed.*  
*Sanguinius halted less than fifty feet into the chamber. He would not be part of the design being woven. Fire on the nerve cluster from this position, Sanguinius commanded. Ignore the daemon.*  
*The sorcerous light returned, and a sudden nova burst from the book. It shot up and behind the daemon, striking the nexus.*  
*Back! Sanguinius ordered.*  
*The conduits disintegrated. Coruscating, murderous light burst from them. It formed a contained ball of energy, blinding in intensity, its convulsions scraping at the mind like claws. It fused tighter, drawing in on itself. It imploded, and now, where the junction had been, was a single point of warp light.*  
*Oh, Sanguinius thought, and then the light came for him.*

Sanguinius and the Daemon have an incredible battle, where the Daemon attacks him on a physical, mental, and spiritual. Through sheer strength and will, Sanguinius is victorious. I will post the entirety of the fight here, because it is just too much awesome not too:

***Spoiler***\*:\*  
*There was a moment of absolute void and then there was a maelstrom of creation, an uncontrolled explosion of being without form. He dropped down its eye, into dark. He fell through blackness veined with red and green and blue and violet, the colours of ruin entwined and cutting into his mind like wire.*

*He did not land, but he stopped falling. He floated in the black. The darkness became mist, gathered definition, and became the bridge of the Vengeful Spirit. He was there again, as present as he had been when he had slipped between realities on the Red Tear. And again, Horus struck him down.*

*The pain again. The pain of final dissolution. He felt himself die, and he felt the grief at treachery and the grief of failure, the grief that his death was meaningless. There was no doubt now. He died, and Horus won, and that was all.*  
*He fell into the dark, and light pierced it again; it became shadows and then substance again, and once more Horus towered over him. Once more, Horus slew him.*  
*The pain, the grief, the futility It was all there again.*  
*And then again.*  
*And again.*  
*And again.*  
*He lived his final moment over and over. The pain never diminished. Each iteration of his doom was as excruciating as the last. He tried to turn his head as the Vengeful Spirit materialised. He was confronted with the same perspective. He groaned, and with a wrenching effort of will, he turned his back on Horus. He spun himself away from the vision, though he heard the sound of his boots against the deck.'*  
*The effort was futile. He turned and turned and turned, and he died and he died and he died. There was no escape, no meaning, no hope. Each time Horus killed him, he saw a trace of the future that would come. Every death brought its consequences. None were repeated. All were terrible. Horus was endlessly triumphant. All that changed was his immediate route to power.*  
*Sanguinius spun faster, the movement no longer of his volition, and he saw endless iterations of his fate at once, as if he were in a mirror corridor, with the same image reflected to infinity. But this was more than an image. It was real. He died a thousand times at once, and the pain was a thousand times amplified.*  
*A new blackness rose. This one was his. It came from within. It was anger that dwarfed the pain. Its jaws were immense, jagged with fangs, breathing flame and hatred. It consumed him, and yet the jaws were his too. With them, he would repay the treacherous galaxy with blood. He roared in an agony of wrath as the images of his death endlessly repeated. Darkness within lashed at the darkness without. Deep in his mind, buried in the agony, a sliver of his identity protested. It did not want this thing he had become. It rejected the black monster that claimed him as its father. His last piece of rationality reached out in desperation for any trace of hope. It flashed through the deaths upon deaths upon deaths, becoming weaker and dimmer as it looked for any meaning, any sign of doom leading to consequences other than eternal night for the Imperium.*  
*At last, the hope appeared. In the infinite variations of the battle against Horus, there was one that challenged predestined death. One vision was different. Only one. In it, Sanguinius dodged the death blow. Horus put so much power into it that he overbalanced when he missed. There was a fraction of a second of hesitation as he sought to correct his momentum. Sanguinius seized the chance, and drove the Blade Encarmine up. It found the weakened point in Horus gorget. It pierced his armour.*  
*It pierced his throat.*  
*It pierced his skull.*  
*This was the outcome Sanguinius had never even dreamed of, because the entire foundations of his destiny were built upon its denial. 'In this one vision, the terrible blackness withered, collapsed and broke apart into whirling ash. Here, and only here, there was hope. Here, and only here, the Imperium did not fall. Here, and only here, the Emperors dream lived on.*  
*Like the coils of a monstrous serpent, the continuum of dooms gathered around Sanguinius. They came to strangle the single hope. They came to destroy the thing that turned them from certainties into mere possibilities. The visions formed a knot around Sanguinius and the image of light. It tightened. The wrenching anger rose once more, fastening its grip on his being. When the knot closed, the light would be gone, and there would only be the fury.*  
*Sanguinius felt the imperative of decision. He made his choice. He refused the blackness and chose hope. He lunged towards the light. He raised his sword and plunged into the vision. He became the Sanguinius who slew Horus. The sword killed Horus, and it cut through his evil dream. It sliced through the knot. The visions fractured, mirrors broken into shards. They fell away into the void.*  
*Now Sanguinius was falling again, but he was not done with the sword. After driving the Blade Encarmine through Horus skull and through the knot of fate, he brought it down. There was so much strength in the blow, it cut through unreality itself.*  
*The blade sank into the flesh of the dream void. It tore the warp fabric open with fire. Light appeared beneath Sanguinius as he fell. He was leaving the realm of visions, but had not yet returned to reality. He was in a nether zone, neither dream nor real, but linked to both states. The light was another knot, another nexus. It looked like the intersection of the manufactorum conduits, only the conduits themselves were absent. It was the flow of warp energy and material mined from the interior of Pyrrhan, the unreal colliding with the solid to form the gate. Searing, impossible creation whirled through the convulsions of the nexus. It was the forge of the new reality of the galaxy. Sanguinius descended, wings outspread, to cleave the knot in two.*  
*He passed through the nexus. In his wake, creation ended. The energy screamed. The uncontrollable explosion spread though the void. A dome of conflagration unfurled above Sanguinius.*  
*Still he fell, still powered by the single sword blow. Another knot of energy appeared, and he cut it, and then the next, and the next, and the next. He had chosen to live, and so had torn destiny open, and with that rupture was slicing apart all the coils with which Chaos sought to entangle him. He was dealing a death blow to a creature he barely understood, whose size he could not grasp, and yet had defeated.*  
*Down, down, down, the great sword blow of hope cutting through all the knots of ruin, a streak of red unleashing the flames of purification, until he cut his way back to reality. The void peeled back. The light of deliverance engulfed him. It blinded him with the blood\-red fire. He blinked, and the flare vanished. He stood in the chamber from which he had first fallen. The daemon was at his feet. Its body was cut in two. As was its book and its staff. Weapons and corpse curled at the edges, dissolving from the materium. Violent light filled the chamber. A sea of liquid fire roiled across the ceiling. Currents of flame strove against each other. Maelstroms formed, melting everything above. Metal and stone dropped in blinding streams to the floor of the chamber. Everything was shaking, cracking, breaking apart.*

What he destroyed in the Warp is destroyed in the Material universe, and as a result of the Daemon and its power being slain, the whole Manufactorum begins to collapse:

***Spoiler***\*:\*  
*Lord Sanguinius? Azkaellon was at his side, half reaching as if unsure whether or not the Angel was an illusion.*  
*Sanguinius looked around, trying to get his bearings. He felt the solidity of the floor beneath his boots. The surface quaked, but did not flow away into dream. He looked at his sons. The Blood Angels were more or less as he had last seen them. More of the company had entered the chamber, but that was the only change in their disposition he could see. They were solid, unwavering in their reality. What happened? he asked.*  
*You vanished, said Azkaellon, alarmed.*  
*On the Red Tear, he had fought visions, but they had been visions. He had not fallen into an elsewhere. The fusion of dreams and reality made him dizzy. How long was I gone?*  
*A few seconds. You and the daemon.*  
*It had felt like hours. A lifetime. As long as death.*  
*His vox\-bead vibrated, erupting with the reports and interrogatives of his captains and Chapter Masters. He listened to them now, putting together what had happened during his absence. He realised after a few moments that he was the author of the new situation in the forge. What he had cut apart in that netherzone was now destroyed in reality. Tangles of conduits all over the manufactorum had exploded, far more than had been targeted. The complex trembled. Its song was broken beyond repair. The manufactorum screamed now. It howled a chorus of final pain and terror. Machines and power were tearing each other apart.*  
*In the hail of reports coming over the vox, a fragment broke through. It was a single word. Brother. The rest was lost in static. But the voice was Guillimans. The Blood Angels were no longer isolated from the other two Legions.*  
*The tremors were growing more violent by the second. The forges scream rose higher, losing coherence, becoming a thunder of catastrophe.*  
*We have triumphed! Sanguinius voxed to the Legion. The enemys works fall before us.*  
*At his nod, Azkaellon ordered, All forces, withdraw immediately.*  
*Spear held high, he led the turn away from the chamber. The tunnel beyond roared. Liquid flame consumed its ceiling too. The conduits split, bleeding energy. Uncanny lightning forked across the width of the corridor. It burned glowing crevasses into the walls and floor.*  
*The Blood Angels raced to keep their victory. The mountainous forge was about to fall in on itself.*  
*We do not die here, Sanguinius thought. My end is not yet.*  
*And then he wondered, Are you sure?*  
*He wasnt. And the uncertainty elated him.*

The Legions evacuate in time, and as they enter their ships, the **entire solar\-system sized Fortress collapses**:

***Spoiler***\*:\*  
*The end of the manufactorum arrived as the combined fleets came over the horizon, putting them once more in the line of fire of the keeps guns. The surface of Pyrrhan flared white. Coronas of warp energy whipped up the pillar, growing vaster with every slashing coil. Pyrrhan imploded, vanishing in an instant, the tiny growth at the end of the pillar sucked into the climbing disintegration. Blasts the size of miniature suns rocked the pillar, and then the dissolution reached the gate itself.*  
*The gun emplacements on the gate fired briefly. They did not destroy their targets before destruction came for them. On the bridge of the Red Tear, Sanguinius watched the holocaust. Warp\-infused flames hundreds of thousands of miles high consumed the gate. The structure lost coherence. It disintegrated. Shrapnel as big as planets spun away from the main body. Solid matter millions of miles thick became vortices, hurling streams of incandescent rubble into the void. The trailing edge of one stream hit the Dark Angels cruiser Claustro, turning the vessel to burning gas. The greatest vortex appeared in the middle of the gate. The eight\-pointed star spiralled into fragments. The breach spread wider with ferocious speed. The colossal structure consumed itself like burning parchment, the edges peeling away from the centre, ash that could smash a battleship to dust billowing to the galactic east and west. The sides of the ruined gate glowed, molten. Between them now was a passage millions of miles wide. The void, stained by the Ruinstorm, was visible on the other side.*  
*Engines powering up to maximum speed, the fleet began the long crossing between walls of infinite fire.*

***Spoiler***\*:\*  
*I was on the edge of dozing off when the earth shook. A commotion erupted around the table. I noticed everybody gazing at the map. It crawled and changed even as I watched. In the centre was still the huge angel\-topped hive of Irongrad. Around it were still the snaking cables of the great pipelines. There was something else, something new, something that reminded me of what I had seen on my way through Irongrad. The earth was splitting all around the hive. Lines of fire appeared.*  
*What is going on? Sejanus asked. Macharius looked at Drake.*  
*The ritual is nearing its climax. The tectonic plates of the world itself are shifting. The power of the Angel of Fire is manifesting.*  
*The wastelands were split by great fiery chasms. Lava bubbled forth, forming rivers and lakes. It looked as if a new lava sea was being born in front of us.*

Also the presence of the Daemon is so powerful it can be felt even by those with no psychic power:

***Spoiler***\*:\*  
*We knew we could take the hive. We had already done so once. That was not in doubt. What was in doubt was our ability to bridge the great moats of lava sliding into place around the city in time to stop the ritual. None of us wanted to contemplate what would happen if we were still on\-planet when the Angel of Fire manifested. One look at Drakes sickly features was enough to convince me that it was not likely to be a pleasant experience.*  
*There was a growing horror in the chamber. In part I suspect it was a product of the manifestation of the Angel. Even people with as much sensitivity to psychic events as a desert rock could sense that there was something wrong. There was a pressure in the air such as you get before a great storm. A cloud of gloom and despair had settled over our entire army. Macharius stared hard at the holo\-map. All of his attention was focused on it. He glared at it as if he believed his hope of rebirth in the Emperors Light depended on it. I suppose in a way it did. Concentrating, Macharius did not fidget. He merely stood there, statue\-still, looking completely at rest. His gaze was fixed unwaveringly on the map, on the great hive that it was his desire to reclaim. A cold light burned in his eyes. It was as if he was staring at some hated personal enemy.*

The shadow of the Daemon's power is reshaping the entire planet's surface:

***Spoiler***\*:\*  
*It seemed that we were insignificant to whatever power was manifesting itself in Irongrad. It was not creating a flaming barrier to keep us out, except perhaps by accident. It was manifesting a tribute to its own glory and might, reshaping the desert and the earth and the elements of rock and fire into a pattern that was significant only to it.*  
*Its very close to the sign of Tzeentch, said Drake. The Changer of Ways. Its obvious now that you point it out.*  
*His voice was so soft it was hard to pick out the words. I think he was speaking only to himself. Nonetheless a chill passed through the room. An eerie silence fell. The inquisitor had named one of those names that it is very ill to speak, one of the greatest of all the enemies of humanity. Anton gave out a soft yelp. I understood why. Was it possible that this great daemon\-god was going to manifest on the surface of Karsk? If it did, what would happen then? Even the shadow of its power was already beginning to reshape the land. Once it was fully present, what would it not be capable of?*

More info on the world being warped:

***Spoiler***\*:\*  
*We swept forwards and I could see the lava flows clearly. Jets of liquid stone spurted upwards, incandescent and ruby red. The earth was cracking. Occasionally, the Baneblade shifted oddly in response to the moving ground. It felt like it might spin out of control if I was not careful. I watched all of the volt gauges and meters carefully. I kept my hands ready on the controls. I did not want to be taken off\-guard by anything. We followed the paths predetermined by Machariuss discovery. It reminded me of our first approach to Irongrad. It was just as tricky and we did not have time to take things slowly and carefully.*  
*The formation rolled on, feeling its way forwards through the shifting terrain where the sign of the daemon\-god was being written on the living flesh of the world. It was slow progress and it became all the slower when the heretics realised what was happening. Not all of them were wrapped up in their ritual summoning. The great batteries on the armoured skin of the city opened fire. Swarms of flyers engaged our air\-cover in battle. Within the city itself I had no doubt troops were being marshalled.*  
*As we got closer to the city, following the channels of the infernal symbol surrounding the hive, the earth tremors became more intense and the air seemed to shimmer and pulse. Whirlpools of multi\-coloured light swirled in the air. At first I thought it was some sort of heat haze. Rocks split and tanks were swallowed like men going down in jungle quicksand. That was not the worst of it.*  
*Out of those swirling whirlpools creatures were starting to emerge. They were roughly humanoid in shape, but their outlines seemed to shimmer and shift as much as the whirlpools that spawned them. They were an odd shade of pink and they belched flame from numerous orifices that seemed to appear in their skin, like blowholes bubbling out of a mudpool. There was something awful just in their very appearance. At times they seemed as if they were not quite solid, not quite there, as insubstantial as a heat\-haze or a fever dream. At other times they looked somehow more solid than a tank. They shimmered and were gone only to reappear a few strides away from where they had been. They opened mouths as wide as their entire bodies, revealing fangs the size of bayonets and roared challenges as they threw themselves at our fighting vehicles.*

The laws of reality are breaking down under the Daemon's power:

***Spoiler***\*:\*  
*I heard Drake grunt behind me. I avoided turning to look at him, but I could not ignore his muttering voice. The power is spiking. What new horror is this?*  
*Looking out through the drive periscope I saw at once what he meant. The statues were coming to life. It sounds absurd when I say it now, but that is exactly what was happening. All of those fire\-winged metal angels were starting to stretch and flex, like men waking from long sleep. I knew then that something truly unnatural was really happening in Irongrad. When statues come to life, stretch out clawed fingers and take to the air on wings of plasma fire, you know that natural law has been suspended. They soared above the burning buildings and seemed to draw strength from the blaze.*  
*Judging from the screams echoing through the streets around me, I was not alone in my realisation. It looked like the citizens of Irongrad were starting to wake up to the truth of what the materialisation of their deity might bring. It was a miracle of sorts but it was a dark and unholy one. Statues should not come to life. They should remain decently posed and immobile. They should not twist and gesture. Most of all they should not sing. From all of the angels came a full\-throated hymn of triumph, at once joyous and evil, strangely thrilling and terribly ominous. The sound did not seem loud within the hull of the Baneblade but the fact that it could be heard at all was troubling. We were supposed to be warded from the siren song of Chaos.*  
*The living statues swooped over us, stretching out their hands and sending bolts of flame arcing down. They splattered off the side of the Baneblade. A strange aroma of brimstone and something else, not unpleasant but haunting and odd was detectable even within the tank. I assumed this must be an actual smell, working through the filters, not something supernatural.*  
*We must hurry, said Drake. The daemon\-god is almost through. Its power is starting to manifest and reality is starting to warp under the force of its power.*

Inquisitor Drake's report on the Daemon:

***Spoiler***\*:\*  
*It is far, far worse even than I had thought it was going to be. The forces of the Architect of Fate have manifested themselves on the surface of this world. The thin skin of mortal reality has broken and that which lurks beneath has become visible. I am making these notes in what may prove to be the final moments of my life in the hope that they may be found and benefit the Imperial force that comes after us.*  
*\(...\)*  
*The skies swirl with daemons but that is nothing to what only a psyker can perceive. The sky above the hive is splitting. A great fissure in reality is opening. Something dark and terrible and majestic is moving through. I pray that we are in time.*

Implication that the Angel of Fire is more powerful than a Warlord Titan:

***Spoiler***\*:\*  
*We piled out of the hatches and swarmed down the sides of the Baneblade. Even that enormous, ancient presence seemed dwarfed by the cathedral.*  
*The air smelled of brimstone and incense and a scent I remembered well from the factorum\-foundries of my youth: molten metal. A strange light glowed around everything. Our surroundings looked too bright, but sometimes shadows that should not have been there rippled across walls, as if cast by something huge moving against a light which had no source in our world. It was eerie, unnatural and disturbing. Sometimes the shadow of the Horrors was visible as if they were just about to manifest.*  
*Over everything was an oppressive sense of the imminence of something supernatural. I felt like I was in the presence of something greater than human, much greater. I was reminded of the moment when I had confronted the Titan in the rubble of the factorum but this was a thousand times worse. The ancient warmachine had been a being compared to which I was an insect. To the thing manifesting itself now, I was a microbe.*

Description of the Angel of Fire entering Realspace for good:

***Spoiler***\*:\*  
*Ahead of us were massed ranks of priests chanting and singing their awful hymn. In front of them stood their High Priest, the focus of the whole devilish ritual. It was not he who commanded our sight though. It was the Angel. It had already manifested under the vast vaulted roof. The hanging banners already smoked and burned in contact with its burning wings. Around it everything seemed to shimmer.*  
*It towered above us, seemingly a hundred times the height of a man. It looked bigger, as if something infinite were compressing itself into the tiny space available in our world. It came from somewhere else where its size had no limit or meaning. In my mind I imagined it larger than a planet, able to hold a whole world in its beautiful clawed hand. Its skin was the colour of bronze. Its robe was shimmering white. Its face was beautiful. Its eyes were filled with fire. Its wings billowed from its back in a cloud of gaseous plasma. It seemed immense but not yet solid. All of the flames in the temple twisted towards it, dancing worshippers genuflecting to their god.*  
*It looked down on us and it smiled.*  
*I felt as if it was looking directly at me. I am sure every man there did. It is a discomforting thing to come under the gaze of a great daemon. It was looking into my soul, seeing my darkest secrets, measuring every particle of sin. It knew me in a moment better than I knew myself. It knew all the dark and hateful things I wanted to keep hidden even from myself. It recognised me as one of its own. It made a beckoning gesture with its hand. There was an awful invitation in the movement. It called upon me to step forwards, to join it, to be purged by its cleansing flame and renewed.*  
*There was a promise of immortality in that gesture and the fulfilment of all my dreams. I could walk forwards and join the ranks of its followers and become one with the immortals. I could welcome the presence of this tremendous cosmic being into my life and become part of its legion of worshippers and leave this place and conquer worlds in its name.*  
*Visions of an eternity of splendour danced before me. I would be ruler of a world, many worlds. My enemies would fear me. Women would adore me. I would be greater than any king. I watched transfixed. I think it was curiosity that saved my soul, strange as that may sound.*  
*For some reason I looked at Macharius, perhaps even then seeking to follow his lead. He stood transfixed. His eyes were locked on the daemonic Angel. There seemed to be some sort of direct communication going on between them. I wondered what he was seeing, what temptations were being placed before him. I was being presented to myself as a conqueror of worlds. He was already all of that and more.*  
*What could it offer him?*

Macharius Vs Incomplete Angel of Fire. While not fully manifested, the Greater Daemon should still scale to the effects its mere summoning was causing. Easily a Planetary threat.

***Spoiler***\*:\*  
*The swirling essence of the daemon descended upon the corpse of the High Priest. The body slowly rose, one eye dangling from an optic nerve torn from its exposed skull. The other was filled with fire. Great flaming wings emerged from his back, a sword of fire appeared in his hands. His ruined corpse had become the vessel of the Angel. Some of the sense of terrible presence was gone.*  
*It has not fully manifested, Drake shouted. It cannot draw on its full power. We can still overcome it.*  
*I was not sure I believed him.*  
*The corpse advanced towards us. The flesh of the right cheek had been ripped away to expose grinning teeth. It looked evil and terrible and filled with awful wrath. Macharius raced to meet it, chainsword screaming in his hand. The daemon parried the blow with its weapon. It seemed impossible something so insubstantial could parry a weapon as solid as a chainsword but it did. It struck back, blade flickering forwards impossibly fast, a line of fire searing Machariuss cheek.*  
*Drake and his psykers started to chant then. A glow surrounded Macharius, of the sort you see depicted in religious paintings of the Emperor and his primarchs. It was the first time I had ever seen it in reality. I swear a halo of light had appeared around Machariuss head. He looked like a saint made flesh, which was in its way reassuring; to survive this we were going to need the assistance of a saint and more even than that.*  
*Macharius fought with the Angel of Fire. I thought I heard something over the roar of battle and the chant of plainsong. I realised it was Drake. He was shouting: Kill the priests!*  
*We waded in among the heretics, stabbing and bludgeoning and shooting. I have never considered it honourable to murder unarmed men but in this case I was prepared to make an exception. The priests screamed and died. The air where the Angel had been swirled; looking up I saw what appeared to be a hole in the fabric of our reality, a gateway to somewhere else, to whatever distant, Chaotic realm the Angel had come from.*  
*All I seemed to see were swirling colours, flames dancing in all manner of strange patterns and bearing a resemblance to whatever real\-world objects my mind projected on to them. They took on shape, like those castles you sometimes see when staring into a fire. I saw molten landscapes over which rose citadels sculpted from flame and around which fluttered hosts of fire\-winged angels. They were assembling themselves into disciplined regiments and preparing to jump the gap to our world.*  
*I tore my gaze away from that portal into an alternative reality and I saw that Macharius was still engaged in hand\-to\-hand combat with the avatar of the Angel of Fire. As ever, he moved with blazing quickness. His motion was a blur, too fast to be followed easily with the human eye. It did not appear as if the daemon had any trouble doing so.*  
*The Angel parried Machariuss blade with its sword of fire. If anything, its attacks were even faster than the generals. I was surprised that anything could live when faced by the full fury of its onslaught.* *:Every time that fiery blade licked out it seemed to impact upon the generals armour. And yet, Macharius did not burn. It took me some time to realise why. He was being protected by the power of our own psykers.*  
*As ever, Macharius had a very sound grasp of the situation. Of course, in all likelihood, he knew no more about how to deal with it than I did. On the other hand, he knew that there was someone present who did.*  
*Close that infernal portal before it is too late. Drake heard and obeyed.*  
*Lines of light began to emerge from all of the Imperial psykers and converge upon the stalwart figure of the inquisitor. He did something with all that power, channelling it into a mesh of potent energy that swirled outwards from his hands and surrounded the glowing gate. He began to pull the net tight. The opening started to close but not without resistance.*  
*Men screamed and I wondered what was happening because there was a note in the screams that I had never heard before. The psykers around Drake started to fall, their mouths open, their faces pale, blood gushing from mouths and nostrils and eye\-sockets. It was not the same sound as the heretics made as they were slaughtered, it was something else, the sound of men who were losing their very souls, having them drawn from their bodies and offered up as a sacrifice to something greater.*  
*Beams of light emerged from Drakes hand and surged around the gateway, forming a lattice around it. His whole body was lit by the energies he wielded. His eyes blazed with the Emperors Light. Every one of the people who still communed with Drake stood frozen. Their eyes were wide, their mouths stretched in ghastly rictuses as if screams were being torn from their very souls. One by one, they toppled and died as if their life force was being wrenched from them and used to power whatever exorcism Drake performed.*  
*The daemon began to oppose the inquisitors efforts and tried to get past Macharius in order to cut him down with its fiery blade. Macharius kept himself interposed. He stood between it and Drake. Seeing the Lord High Commander at risk, more and more of our soldiers pressed forwards. The Angel chopped down but it could not find a way through that wall of flesh that opposed it. What human courage and human muscle could achieve our soldiers did. They wanted to protect Macharius even at the cost of their own lives. They threw themselves forwards, again and again forming a rampart of blood and gristle. I saw Anton and Ivan struggle to get forwards. They were almost within striking distance of the Angel when I lost sight of them in the press.*

All of the fire and energy seemed to be being sucked out of the air around us and returned to the place from which it had come, and as it did so I could see that the Angel of Fire was being drawn back into its own fiery realm. It fought every step of the way but, at last, it passed through the portal and that eerie gateway swirled shut.*

Why even take the time to write the comment in the first place? You spent a few minutes of your life telling me how you dislike this video (and me personally) over something so... boring & mundane. I've been on reddit long enough to have seen just about everything so I'm leaning more towards a lack of opinion on the actual video and more towards someone who has a problem with me personally. Probably a sockpuppet of a mod who I once worked with (perhaps still work with), but didn't care for me? If that's the case, you clearly didn't learn much in your tenure with me. 

Just a pro-tip: This level of trolling is barely enough to cause an eyelash to flutter. You're playing with the big boys now so you need to up your game several levels. If you're incapable, you probably should head back to 4chan or trolling soccermom book-club facebook groups. ",2018-05-30 05:03:48
581,"I didn't see your entire message earlier for some reason. So, while you are technically right, they have enums, there is a reason why a google dart library describes one of it's features as [generating enums](https://github.com/google/built_value.dart). The reason is Darts enum implementation is nothing more than a type alias over an integer. Maybe I'm slightly exaggerating, but I see no advantage over their current implementation, and instead just creating some integer values that have unique values. i.e. in Java I'd:

```
public class Fruit {
    public static int apple = 0;
    public static int banana = 1;
    public static int grape = 2;
}
```

That appears to be the equivalent of Dart's enums. The enum implementation in it's current form is all but useless, and I found it to be useless, which is probably why I remembered it as it not being there.

> Isolates are a truly parallel solution for dart
Performance problems have plagued isolates for years, and they are extremely complicated to work with. Maybe they've improved this (and by all means they should). Isolates are by all means terrible. 

The only way to communicate between Isolates is to serialize the data and send it to the isolate, which then deserializes the data and handles it. It's almost like you are making a inter-process server call. Every time you want to do something in a separate thread, do you feel that makes sense?

About a year ago, someone wanted to use flutter to deserialize a few MB of data. It was taking ~10 seconds to deserialize everything, and was blocking the drawing thread. So it was recommended to him that he needed to use an isolate. The problem was if he deserializes it in an isolate, how does he now send it back to the main thread? He has the the serialize it again, to send it, leaving the main thread deserializing everything all over again. He had to create a paging solution, where he slowly transferred the data over in small chunks so that the main thread wasn't blocked for too long. That's just mind numbing.

I really liked the idea of Flutter. I was super onboard for a while. It's just a shame it was implemented in Dart. I'm just not a fan. I spent several weeks trying to get into it, trying to make excuses for the languages shortcomings. Fanboying ends up helping no one though, and lead to me wasting a lot of time and being frustrated.

I'm a Junior in High School and this has been going on since the start of my Sophomore year. At first it was like I'd imagine living in hell. I couldn't walk alone to take the bus because my heart would start speeding so much that I'd be 100% convinced that I was about to die, right there just like that. That one happened during a rainy morning. It was still dark and I knew something felt weird. I am almost done walking until I feel my heart fluttering. I knew I had to go back because it was too much for me to handle. As I walk back, it gets worse and worse to the point I have to stop in the middle of nowhere to DIE! I was sooo convinced it was over for me but it obviously wasn't. I slowly got back home all wet and since that day, it all started.

How did I deal with it? I started keeping a journal and trying to identify what the hell was causing that. I went to lots of doctors to see if there was something physically wrong, but all clear. What ended up making it manageable was to talk to someone about it. You try to convince yourself that you're not going to die during a panic attack or even before one but your mind already made the decision to worry about it. You need something strong enough to 100% convince you that you're not about to die. It could be therapy, a testimony from someone with anxiety, a motivational video, etc...

Also, not sleeping well, eating unhealthy, being alone and on your on for too long can all cause this to happen and make it worse over time. And the ONLY thing you should avoid is actually avoiding anything that gives you anxiety. The moment you avoid something, you're telling that part of your brain that worries, regardless if you said to yourself that you're not in danger, that you are actually in danger and that's why you're avoiding that. When you see what you avoided again, your brain will give you a sweet panic attack or a great deal of anxiety. ",2018-06-02 06:14:05

From that point, the child\-goddess began to follow Veilania almost incessantly, rarely disappearing for more than a week. She was not always directly with her, but stayed close even as she pursued her own fleeting interests, playing with children or flying or experimenting with her own strength against Angels and Demons and mortals imbued with their power. Being divine, her strength was remarkable though fluctuated\- the girl could recover from the rare wounds she suffered in seconds, but often fled tearfully as soon as cut.   

Despite her words, Kepi showed little interest in learning Binding Magic, distracting herself and others at any point a lesson was attempted and often forgetting crucial details between them. The one facet that held her attention was letters\- she absorbed their system of reading and writing enthusiastically and delighted in writing stories and memories and absurdities down.   

She also tried to practise with her true divine powers, and created two new species to impress Veilania. The first was Fluttervoid, a species of black butterfly which emitted light absorbing dusty scales around itself to hide, only revealing its red patterned wings when completely still. The second, occupying far more of her attention, were small predatory mammals with long tails and the ability to perceive unbound spirits with their silvery eyes. Kepi called them Kats and named as many of them as she could.

She tolerated Kepi's lack of focus in learning Binding, she was a child at heart after all, and did what she could to help her learn the Binder's Script.

Veil was *delighted* with the Fluttervoids and Kats. 

When Kepi showed her the Fluttervoids, Veil sat *perfectly still* among a collection of them so that they would land on her. She rather wanted to train a few of them to ride along on her cloak, to provide proper ambiance during an entrance (as Veilania was rather fond of dramatic entrances).

Veilania found the Kats to be charming, and *useful*. Their talent for seeing Unbound Spirits meant that they were *very* useful companions to her followers. A properly trained Kat could find unbound Angels or Demons before they messed with someone, and bring a Binder to deal with it before it became a problem.

""Right, ladies! T'day we're gunna lern aboot Brarhead Hoonds! Tern to page 69 of yer textbooks!""  

There was a flutter of paper  as students opened their books.  A Japanese girl to Hermione's right raised her hand.  

""P-Professor? Do you mean, Braehead Hounds?"" 

""Aye, chinky,"" Haggard replied, ""Thas what I said - Brarhead Hoonds.""

There was a pause  as Haggard opened the gate. Two excited Braehead Hounds leapt and barked.

""Ahh need two 2volunteers!"" Haggard boomed.  

He scratched his beard and looked at the class before suddenly pointing at Hermione. 

""Whoremione! You'll do! And I need one more... Oy! Slanty eyes! You're up as well! Get in the pen!"" 

Hermione and the Japanese  girl stood up and stepped into the Braehead Hounds'  pen.

""Now, girls. These are magical creechurs. Yeh have to be be very careful because these are horny dogs! I'm gunna teach yeh how to handle them safely!""

Haggard then closed the gate and locked it shut.  

*Ring ring*    

""Aww shit, that's mah phone.  I'll be back faster than Congress  can impeach Trump.""    

Haggard wandered off, leaving the girls locked inside the wooden fence with the Hounds while the class watched.  Suddenly the Braehead Hounds  began to walk towards the girls!

""G-good d-doggy..."" the Japanese  girl whimpered, stepping back and raising open palms.   

Suddenly, one of the Hounds  leapt at her, knocking her onto her back. She landed on the ground, her schoolgirl skirt lifting up to reveal her panties. Hermione watched as the Japanese  girl's arms sank into the muddy earth.  She struggled to stand back up - but her arms were completely stuck! 

The Braehead Hound  wasted no time ploughing its snout  between her yellow thighs. It's sharp teeth quickly found her cotton panties and chewed them off, exposing her virgin pussy to the entire class!

""N-Noooo!"" she screamed.

Hermione panicked as the second Hound turned to face her. In a frantic flurry she made a dash  for the wooden fence. There was a small crack between the planks - maybe enough for Hermione to squeeze through. She could hear the Hound chasing her!

""Ah! Dammit!"" Hermione cried.

She had tried to dive through the gap, but she had only managed to get her upper half through the hole. She was stuck waist down in the pen. No matter how she struggled and wriggled, the little witch couldn't break free.

She frantically searched for her wand,  grabbing it from her cloak's pocket. As she lifted the magical stick to cast a spell it was snatched from her hand! 

""Sorry, does this belong to you, Whoremione?"" Muffloy jeered.

The Slither-in student had stolen her only defence against the Hound.

""Give that back!"" Hermione yelled.

""No, I think the class would rather watch what happens next, you filthy mudblood."" 

The Japanese  girl's arms were still stuck in the thick muddy soil. The Braehead Hound  had buried its head between her thighs now. Its long, wet  tongue  was repeatedly caressing her virgin slit, lapping up her teenage juices.

The Hound slurped and slobbered    at her cunt, its hot tongue  driving her  with unwanted pleasure. Her little clitoris  was burning with each graze of the beast's  talented muscle.  

""Oh!!! Ohhhhh! I'm cuuummmmmiing!"" she screamed, her body convulsing. 

She shook and thrashed near-uncontrollably. The unwanted orgasm rocked her body to its core. But the Hound  wasn't finished yet - it continued licking  even after she had finished.

""W-Wait! Ahhh! T-too sensitive!!!! Ooooohhhh! Ahhhhhhhh!!!""

Hermione was not having much luck  either. The second Hound had placed its paws upon her back in an attempt to mount her. It's hard, eight 8inch shaft was already pressing up against her tight vulva  through her panties. It thrust forward as hard as it could, but the elastic panties refused to yield. 

""Oh! Ah! Bad dog! Ah!"" Hermione gasped.

She struggled to break free and keep her composure in front of her class. If she could only last until Haggard came back...

*rrrrriiiipppp*

""AHHHHHHH!""

Hermione's panties suddenly snapped and eight inches of doggy dick plunged into her soaking wet pussy.   

She felt it fill up her body, stretching her cunt with its thick cock. Almost immediately it began to thrust in and out at an inhumanly quick pace. 

""Ah! Ah! Ah!"" 

Her moans came fast. Too fast. She could barely catch her breath.  She curled her toes  as the pleasure spread like a plague  throughout her body. With each thrust her big breasts   swung back and forth.

She clenched her hands  and banged her fists  against the fence. Her efforts were fruitless though - she was well and truly stuck.

The Japanese  student had cum four 4times now. Her little mind was going blank as the hound's  unceasing tongue  never stopped licking.

""Aaaahhh! Oh yes!! Yesss!!! I'm a little doggy slut!!! Lick  my pussy  !"" she hollered, another orgasm washing through her body.

Hermione felt something thick begin to swell within her pussy.  

""Oh look,"" Muffloy laughed, ""it's knotting Whoremione!""

The swelling pushed up and stretched her pussy, placing an immense pressure upon her quivering g-spot. This was enough to drive  her over the edge.

""Oh! Oh fuck! I'm cummming! Nooooooohhhhhhh!!!""

Hermione's body betrayed her as she came. Seconds later she heard the Hound howl.

""Arroooooo!""

""No! Don't cum inside me!""

Hermione knew that many of the magical creatures in Haggard's class could impregnate girls. Right now was a very dangerous time of the month for her!

She felt a hot, goopy fluid rush into the depths of her pussy  and flood into her fertile womb. The sensation was enough to send a second orgasm through her teenage body. Already, the Hound's sperm were swimming towards her teenage eggs , seeking to fertilise them. As the Braehead Hound  continued to cum, the cum began to leak  out of her pussy  and trickle down her thighs.

""Hahaha!"" the class roared in laughter at the two girls' plight. 

""Looks like Whoremione is going to be a pregnant slut now!"" Muffloy jeered, egging the crowd on.

""N-noooooo! Get me out of the fence! I- ahhh- I need to get the cum out! Ooooh!""

After five minutes of pumping her pussy  full of cum,  the Hound finally released her, leaving her lower half drenched in thick white semen.  The Japanese  girl wasn't faring any better. The Hound  had finally left her alone - but she was still quivering on the ground in the aftershock of twelve 12consecutive orgasms.

Haggard returned four hours later - long enough for the Hounds to fuck the Japanese  girl, and for Hermione's tight little ass  to get flooded with doggy cum too.



""Oh bugger,"" mumbled Haggard, ""I've already hit mah allowed limit of eight impregnated students this month. The school nurse is gunna kill  me...""",2018-06-02 13:07:13
609,"Haggard  was a fat giant of a man. He towered over his students at nine 9feet tall. Hermione watched in awe as he guided his students  into the magical creature pen just outside his wooden hut.  

""Right, ladies! T'day we're gunna lern aboot Brarhead Hoonds! Tern to page 69 of yer textbooks!""  

There was a flutter of paper  as students opened their books.  A Japanese girl to Hermione's right raised her hand.  

""P-Professor? Do you mean, Braehead Hounds?"" 

""Aye, chinky,"" Haggard replied, ""Thas what I said - Brarhead Hoonds.""

There was a pause  as Haggard opened the gate. Two excited Braehead Hounds leapt and barked.

""Ahh need two 2volunteers!"" Haggard boomed.  

He scratched his beard and looked at the class before suddenly pointing at Hermione. 

""Whoremione! You'll do! And I need one more... Oy! Slanty eyes! You're up as well! Get in the pen!"" 

Hermione and the Japanese  girl stood up and stepped into the Braehead Hounds'  pen.

""Now, girls. These are magical creechurs. Yeh have to be be very careful because these are horny dogs! I'm gunna teach yeh how to handle them safely!""

Haggard then closed the gate and locked it shut.  

*Ring ring*    

""Aww shit, that's mah phone.  I'll be back faster than Congress  can impeach Trump.""    

Haggard wandered off, leaving the girls locked inside the wooden fence with the Hounds while the class watched.  Suddenly the Braehead Hounds  began to walk towards the girls!

""G-good d-doggy..."" the Japanese  girl whimpered, stepping back and raising open palms.   

Suddenly, one of the Hounds  leapt at her, knocking her onto her back. She landed on the ground, her schoolgirl skirt lifting up to reveal her panties. Hermione watched as the Japanese  girl's arms sank into the muddy earth.  She struggled to stand back up - but her arms were completely stuck! 

The Braehead Hound  wasted no time ploughing its snout  between her yellow thighs. It's sharp teeth quickly found her cotton panties and chewed them off, exposing her virgin pussy to the entire class!

""N-Noooo!"" she screamed.

Hermione panicked as the second Hound turned to face her. In a frantic flurry she made a dash  for the wooden fence. There was a small crack between the planks - maybe enough for Hermione to squeeze through. She could hear the Hound chasing her!

""Ah! Dammit!"" Hermione cried.

She had tried to dive through the gap, but she had only managed to get her upper half through the hole. She was stuck waist down in the pen. No matter how she struggled and wriggled, the little witch couldn't break free.

She frantically searched for her wand,  grabbing it from her cloak's pocket. As she lifted the magical stick to cast a spell it was snatched from her hand! 

""Sorry, does this belong to you, Whoremione?"" Muffloy jeered.

The Slither-in student had stolen her only defence against the Hound.

""Give that back!"" Hermione yelled.

""No, I think the class would rather watch what happens next, you filthy mudblood.""

610,"> I think it's better to migrate to Flutter (or other similar >frameworks) because they're easy and productive, also can cover >most of the use-cases.

For simple apps, hobby apps or for startups, it might be a good solution to start.

But lets talk about some real apps with millions of users,
and let's assume that we have a team of 15 android developers.

Here is some issues that flutter hasn't give an answer yet. Because i don't think that flutter is ""production"" ready.

1. Its written in dart. (Everyone knows the advantages of kotlin vs dart)
2. There is no ecosystem. There are no good/tested solutions for real world problems, like db, http requests, crash reporting

Do you think that the ""http"" library from flutter is the same as ""okhttp""? Or the beta library of flutter for sql is the same as Room?

3. Annotation processors. A lot of teams are using them in order to reduce boiler plate and to increase the quality of their applications.
Flutter doesn't have anything related to that.

4. Lint tools etc etc

5. On flutter there is no proper threading. Everything is hidden behind ""futures"" and ""*async"". What will developers do when they will need to handle with this? And isolates is a different thing. Its not the same as threads!

6. Flutter doesn't provide services, job schedulers and anything that it cannot be bind between the two platforms.

7. Do you think that based on the current setup of flutter, if 10-15 developers work on the same project for 1 - 2 years, that the quality of this project will be good? Because i don't really think that this is going to be possible.

IMO flutter is going to be something like the chromebooks. A beta project from google, that covers some specific use case and thats all. No improvements or anything that really matters for the developers and the companies.

*****
Chopper's job was tonotlet them untie the binds. In fact, it had been hard enough getting them to wear runners in the first place. Luckily all the guys wanted to out-machismo one another, so some bullshit five-kilometer island marathon was cooked up. As was breakfast. They'd called Sanji in for that.
Law had complained about running on a full stomach, but one Sanji glare  he'd especially prepared onigiri  let him know he wouldn't be running at all if he didn't eat.

The trickiest aspect was changing the laces of their sneakers. They had to tip the ends in seastone so neither devil-fruit user could touch them, but all creatures of stealth were also users.

*****

""Shouldn't the footbath be for the finish, yoi?""

Marco, Law and the others sat at the outdoor stations, the water from the hot springs softening their feet.

""As good before as after.""

Law wasn't so sure. His energy sank a little with the water. They were soon out, though. Robin, despatched hands to give all participants a foot massage. The hands then returned socks and shoes to feet, tying laces loosely on Law and Marco's runners.

Outside the Baratie, they soaked up the morning sun. Other participants limbered up, while Law and Marco ate onigiri. Sanji served grilled fish and miso too. Law murmured thanks. He bore scars from when he'd spat the umeboshi onigiri into his hand years ago. Jeez, it wasn't like he was alone in not liking umeboshi. Was the hiding for wasting food or poor manners? Robin said manners.

Speaking of which. Chopper was on the cute mission. Marco was made of sterner stuff, but when Chopper sat between the two, (timing was essential), getting Law to demonstrate with plastic chopsticks and a teaspoon the best way to insert a stent, he turned to Marco often with wonder at his talented surgeon partner, and the Phoenix remained.

Robin sent a pair of hands, clad in gloves protecting skin from seastone, under the table. Franky's design.
Marco and Law's shoelaces were already loose and sloppy from the footbath. Sanji had rushed the two to breakfast, not giving them a chance to properly tighten them. Robin slipped out the laces. Chopper yabbered on, heart eyes aflutter. Law's soft spot for fluffy things well known. Marco gained amusement watching Law.
Robin's extra appendages threaded the seastone-dipped, seastone-tipped laces through the eyelets of one shoe of either man. She then tied these laces to each other and joined their chair legs.

""Huh."" Marco paled. Law looked up, then did the same.

""Not feeling too good."" He lowered the miso bowl he'd lifted to his mouth, and rested his head. Chopper jumped on the table, a hoof to Law's forehead.

""You're burning up.""

He urged Marco to tip his head.

""You too. No running.""

Law tried to sit up. They'd trained so hard. Tried to call Kikoku. Nothing. He curved his hand. No blue dome.

""Weird."" He attempted pushing the chair back, standing up, but his leg, his foot was stuck, and Marco jostled with Law's movements. His energy was incredibly low.

""The fuck?""

Marco looked down. He'd been mirroring Law  wasn't able to ignite a flame.

Seastone laces glittered.

""Fuck are they?""

Law bent over to untie or slice them, but he didn't have the strength to wield Kikoku and, man, nothing felled him like seastone.

*****

Nami had 100,000 Beri riding on Ussop with outsider odds in the marathon. Sure, he was fast and flighty and energetic, and stood a good chance, but you couldn't trust the devil-fruit users tonotuse their powers.

Luffy's impatience would disqualify him  doing something reckless like gripping a barrier near the finish and letting his rubber abilities shoot him over the line.

Zoro would get lost, so she didn't worry about him. Sanji had to work. Robin and she were sitting this one out and, lately, wherever Robin was, Franky was too. There was an age limit. Brook waswayover. She'd laid out distractions for the Heart pirates. Female minks, bars, hookers, shiny things.

The Strawhats were on board, because if Ussop won, she promised to annul their debts. Zoro and Luffy had some trouble counting, so they oweda lot. Luffy swore he'd get disqualified, which meant he probably wouldn't.

Law and Marco were usually too clever to owe Nami anything, a bit like Robin. Alternative measures, means, were forged to bind them together and make them stay that way.

*****

Ussop's cackle was wild. Trophy in hand, he returned to the Baratie, Nami behind, counting beri. They came across the two  kind of strange to see them in shorts  flat on the table, asleep. Sanji bitched theyd scared all the customers away.

Ussop ducked under the table and loosened the ties, extracting the offending seastone. In fact, Nami holding one side of a shoelace and Ussop the other was probably what stopped Kikoku from slicing them into four parts  in the safety of Law's Room of course.

Then Marco and Law were gone. Replaced with Zoro  still wandering  and a startled participant. Both looked down and lifted their arms with distaste from the sticky tabletop, pools of drool moistening their elbows.",2018-06-02 13:23:48

616,"When I got back I to swimming at 32 I had not been una pool for 15 years and had not had formal swimming lessons for 20 with only ever completing the first 3 or 4 levels. Needless to say I was awful and could barely make it to the end of the 25m pool in my board shorts.

After a few weeks of practice once a week I was going 100 metres, then 200, then 300 and so on. Point I am trying to make is that once you get i. The pool and start working on it you gain basic ability and add distance fairly quickly.

My suggestions would be to grab a kick-board get in the pool and do 100 metre flutter kick set. Nice and relaxed. The boards will give you some floatation and the kick set will get you used to the body position for freestyle. Once you are comfortable with that come back another day put some fins in and do the same thing, then come back another day and do a freestyle set with fin then finally freestyle without fins. Once you get to that point you are just adding endurance which, for less than 1000m, is just time in the pool. ",2018-06-02 14:34:06

Fandom: Fallout: NV

Context: Megan has been double-crossed (again), drugged, and left to die at the top of a bell tower in a dead city full of hostile creatures called Ghosts.  In fifteen minutes, the gates of the casino will close, trapping her outside.  She just so happens to have a bunch of adrenaline/epinephrine on hand, and has just used that to temporarily override the opiate overdose.  God, an enormous, mutated human, is an ally.

What I'm looking for: Is the scene tense enough?  How can I make it more desperate and urgent?  Also, if anyone has any medical expertise, could epinephrine work to keep someone awake and moving for a short time in a situation like this?  Thanks.  

>The ladder proved challenging.  Her muscles felt like rubber bands drawn tight, jangling like strings on a guitar.  She kept forgetting whether she was going up or down, something that frightened her more than a little.  The trapdoor was above, and the concrete floor was below, but she couldnt tell how far shed traveled.  An eternity of climbing went by before she missed a rung and fell the last few feet, her sweat-slippery fingers losing their grip on the bars.  It didnt hurt - honestly, she didnt think anything in the world could have caused her pain at the moment - but it did stun her for a moment, knocking the air out of her lungs.  The lethargy was creeping back and she pulled out the next syringe and used it as well, jamming her the needle into her twitching muscle.

>The rush of the chemical got her on her feet again, but at the cost of another shock to her system.  Im dying, she decided, as she staggered in the direction she thought shed last seen the casino.  It certainly felt like near-death experiences shed had before.  She was scared and she couldnt get enough air, and all she could hear was the pounding of her own heart in her ears.

>Help, she croaked out through dry lips, then fell silent.  There was no one around except Ghosts.  She needed to move on her own power.  To run as if her life depended on it.  Too late, she regretted leaving the bell tower, but climbing back up wasnt feasible.  Instead, she chose a path through the villa and ran, hoping against hope that it was the right one.  

>This had all the earmarks of a nightmare - the sensation of being chased, the visceral fear knotting up her stomach, and the confusion that kept her thoughts in a constant whirlwind.  She staggered in and out of shops, upstairs and downstairs, catching only the occasional glimpse of the last rays of the sun gleaming off of the crest of the casino roof.  Somehow, she met no hostile Ghosts, though dark shapes fluttered always at the edge of her vision.  Maybe they took her for one of their own, another lost, disoriented prisoner in the warrens of the old resort.

>Stumbling into an open space, her legs gave out abruptly and she fell for the last time, bruising her chin and almost breaking her teeth out against a stone ledge.  Above her, as if through a misty curtain, she could see the ghost of a beautiful woman in an ancient dress, revolving slowly over a dead fountain.  Her hand curled spasmodically around the third and last syringe in her pocket, but she didnt quite dare to use it.  She suspected she was close now and didnt want to die of a heart attack so near her goal.  Shed have a rest, and then shed run, walk, or crawl the last short distance.  She could spare a minute, surely.  Heedless of the danger, her eyes slid closed.

>Are you still alive?  A harsh voice chewed at her ears and called her back from the darkness.  Must be, or Id know.  There was humorless laughter, like rocks in a rusty pipe, and rough, giant hands lifted her.  You smell like chems, God told her.  You smell like the ghoul.  I told you to watch him, didnt I?  Well, Ill kill him for you and get back your toy",2018-06-02 14:38:52

Suddenly, one of the Hounds  leapt at her, knocking her onto her back. She landed on the ground, her schoolgirl skirt lifting up to reveal her panties. Hermione watched as the Japanese  girl's arms sank into the muddy earth.  She struggled to stand back up - but her arms were completely stuck!

The Slither-in student had stolen her only defence against the Hound.

""Give that back!"" Hermione yelled.

""No, I think the class would rather watch what happens next, you filthy mudblood."" 

The Japanese  girl's arms were still stuck in the thick muddy soil. The Braehead Hound  had buried its head between her thighs now. Its long, wet  tongue  was repeatedly caressing her virgin slit, lapping up her teenage juices. 

""Ah! Ah! Ahhh! St-stooohhhhp! Ayaaaaahhhhhh!""

The Hound slurped and slobbered    at her cunt, its hot tongue  driving her  with unwanted pleasure. Her little clitoris  was burning with each graze of the beast's  talented muscle.  

""Oh!!! Ohhhhh! I'm cuuummmmmiing!"" she screamed, her body convulsing. 

She shook and thrashed near-uncontrollably. The unwanted orgasm rocked her body to its core. But the Hound  wasn't finished yet - it continued licking  even after she had finished.

""W-Wait! Ahhh! T-too sensitive!!!! Ooooohhhh! Ahhhhhhhh!!!""

Hermione was not having much luck  either. The second Hound had placed its paws upon her back in an attempt to mount her. It's hard, eight 8inch shaft was already pressing up against her tight vulva  through her panties. It thrust forward as hard as it could, but the elastic panties refused to yield. 

""Oh! Ah! Bad dog! Ah!"" Hermione gasped.

She struggled to break free and keep her composure in front of her class. If she could only last until Haggard came back...

*rrrrriiiipppp*

""AHHHHHHH!""

Hermione's panties suddenly snapped and eight inches of doggy dick plunged into her soaking wet pussy.   

She felt it fill up her body, stretching her cunt with its thick cock. Almost immediately it began to thrust in and out at an inhumanly quick pace. 

""Ah! Ah! Ah!"" 

Her moans came fast. Too fast. She could barely catch her breath.  She curled her toes  as the pleasure spread like a plague  throughout her body. With each thrust her big breasts   swung back and forth.

She clenched her hands  and banged her fists  against the fence. Her efforts were fruitless though - she was well and truly stuck.

The Japanese  student had cum four 4times now. Her little mind was going blank as the hound's  unceasing tongue  never stopped licking.

""Aaaahhh! Oh yes!! Yesss!!! I'm a little doggy slut!!! Lick  my pussy  !"" she hollered, another orgasm washing through her body.

Hermione felt something thick begin to swell within her pussy.  

""Oh look,"" Muffloy laughed, ""it's knotting Whoremione!""

The swelling pushed up and stretched her pussy, placing an immense pressure upon her quivering g-spot. This was enough to drive  her over the edge.

""Oh! Oh fuck! I'm cummming! Nooooooohhhhhhh!!!""

Hermione's body betrayed her as she came. Seconds later she heard the Hound howl.

""Arroooooo!""

""No! Don't cum inside me!""

Hermione knew that many of the magical creatures in Haggard's class could impregnate girls. Right now was a very dangerous time of the month for her!

She felt a hot, goopy fluid rush into the depths of her pussy  and flood into her fertile womb. The sensation was enough to send a second orgasm through her teenage body. Already, the Hound's sperm were swimming towards her teenage eggs , seeking to fertilise them. As the Braehead Hound  continued to cum, the cum began to leak  out of her pussy  and trickle down her thighs.

""Hahaha!"" the class roared in laughter at the two girls' plight. 

""Looks like Whoremione is going to be a pregnant slut now!"" Muffloy jeered, egging the crowd on.

""N-noooooo! Get me out of the fence! I- ahhh- I need to get the cum out! Ooooh!""

After five minutes of pumping her pussy  full of cum,  the Hound finally released her, leaving her lower half drenched in thick white semen.  The Japanese  girl wasn't faring any better. The Hound  had finally left her alone - but she was still quivering on the ground in the aftershock of twelve 12consecutive orgasms.

Haggard returned four hours later - long enough for the Hounds to fuck the Japanese  girl, and for Hermione's tight little ass  to get flooded with doggy cum too.

624,"At first, Becca had been certain that she was treading upon nearly virgin\-ground within the old temple. She felt so smart, so superior, for ignoring the hieroglyphics depicting the awful scenes awaiting any within, she had gotten by the traps\-noting the dried blood on some, and she had even ventured close to the inner sanctum. Treasures and fame awaited her, she was certain.

But as her first day within these walls began to come to a close, something started whispering to her. At first, it was just background noise, something easily written off as intrusive thoughts. But the further within the walls she penetrated, the clearer and more insistent the whispering became. And that's when she realized that the runic markings, the holy symbols, the traps, these were not designed to keep her out, but to keep something else within. Something dark and powerful, something which even now had tendrils of power seeping into her mind.

She blinked her eyes rapidly, and realized that for the third time in the last hour her left hand was creeping down the front of her shorts, fingers subtly reaching for the undeniable wetness between her thighs. Becca shook her head, her red hair swaying side\-to\-side as she attempted to reclaim control over her thoughts. 

""I need to get the fuck out of here,"" she said to the dripping walls around her. This wasn't a holy temple, it wasn't a sanctuary, it wasn't a sacrificial altar to a forgotten god. It was a prison for an alien intelligence whose powers Becca was only beginning to understand. But why, she wondered, was it so insistent upon her pussy. 

Initially she had written off the incredible spike in her libido as nothing more than the rush of adrenaline that so often comes with conquest of something new. Her nipples had stiffened, and her thoughts turned to sex, but that happens sometimes. The intrusive thoughts that she had thought to be her own kept coming back to her, reminding her how good it would feel to just relax, spread her legs, and cum over and over. Even now, that voice was in the back of her head, whispering to her, and she could feel it somehow bending her will. It was so hard to fight, after all, didn't she want to feel good?

She began to run, trying to trace the route she had taken to get here, but at each turn the voice was there, insisting that she go another direction. The noise within her head was overwhelming and soon, she was lost. Her breath came in rapid succession, her heart jackhammered away inside her chest, and tears began to stream down her cheeks. 

""Stupid,"" she thought. ""I am so fucking stupid."" 

How could she have ignored all the signs? How could she have forgotten to tell anyone her plans? How could she resist...

Her fingers fluttered against her clit and she moaned. It felt good, better even than the voice had promised. She collapsed to the floor, her thighs spreading instinctively.

""Maybe,"" she thought, ""Maybe if I just give in, cum quickly, I can get control back. This will work.""

In a flash, her right hand was between her legs, deftly massaging her clit in a rapid, circular motion. Becca masturbated with an intensity she'd never experienced before; she didn't want to cum, she needed it, needed the release on a molecular level. Her left hand came up and formed a death grip on her breasts, pinching and kneading at her nipples, while her right kept up a relentless pace with her clit. Faster and faster, her breath coming in short gasps. 

Becca didn't notice the way the walls had stopped dripping, she didn't notice the vines that seemed to be inching towards her, her entire world had narrowed down to a tiny piece of space located on her clitoris which she was dutifully stroking, drawing forth pleasure at the command of an intelligence she knew to be greater than her own. And then, with a final rush of energy, she pushed herself over the peak and climaxed with a back\-arching, ear\-piercing squeal of pleasure. As she did, an orgasm more intense than any she'd ever experienced sent her into a series of convulsions, her body twitching and flailing on the floor, her mind going blank. 

It was long, too, longer than any orgasm she'd ever experienced. It was so hard to know what was real afterward, so hard to trust her thoughts when she knew her mind was betraying her. She knew she couldn't move, though she couldn't recall the vines that had overtaken her wrists and ankles and now lay criss\-crossed over her chest. She knew she couldn't focus, her thoughts were cloudy and dim, but she also knew she didn't care. 

In that moment of post\-orgasmic bliss it became clear what her purpose was. She needed to cum again, cum with this whispering creature deep inside of her. This may not have been a temple, but that didn't mean she couldn't be a convert. She needed to meet her new Master, to worship it, to draw forth it's pleasure with her body and then, as a reward, she would be allowed to leave, carrying its seed in her womb to bring forth a new era in the outside world. Becca smiled as she rocked her hips against the empty air, knowing that her future was making its way down the dark, cool corridors to show her a new world of possibility.",2018-06-02 15:38:11

Warning, slightly suggestive at points

Inky! Look at this one! Sera said, an impish grin on her face as she tossed a book from the pile over to Tanith. The two of them had decided to make their honeymoon productive and had searched around Kirkwall for as many trashy novels about the Inquisition they could find. Tanith looked at the book her wife had passed her. Upon the cover was an. Embellished picture of her and Sera, gazing into eachothers eyes, Taniths excessively long hair and some artfully placed plants keeping the cover tantalising but safe to sell in public. She raised her eyebrows and turned the book over

*The Randy Dowager welcomes the fresh breeze of spring with the new tale* An Inquisitive Affair *a saucy tale of passion between two different stations. Will the two lovers make it together? Or will duty come between their blossoming love?*

*The Randy Dowager: Exhibitions for the noble of thought, but the spry of step.*

*The Lady herself says: Definitely one for those who love secrets laid bare as well as the flesh. Four scarves fluttered in shock out of five.*

I guess our wedding made quite the impact. The qunari said, flipping open the book, part of her hoping there were some slightly less tasteful pictures inside. I wondered who that author Josie was making a big deal about was. 

Sera snorted. Course it was ruffles who invited em. Wouldnt be surprised if shes wrote something for them herself! Come on, read some out, I wanna know how bad it is. She said, scooting over to Tanith to get a better look at the book. Tanith grinned at her and started to read. The sound of thunder boomed across the sky, as the mighty qunari stood in her room, brooding. This elf may have been a mere servant - *Mere servant?! This authors certainly got a pair. Sera snarked.* -But she awoke something deep within her. A blazing fire that could only be put out with *her* lips.

Sera smirked. Funny, I always found my fingers did a better job at tha- Tanith threw a pillow at her. Alright alright, my turn. She grabbed the book from Tanith and flipped to a different page. Its no use Inquisitor Tanya! She said, putting on a breathy falsetto. Our love will never be approved of by the nobles of Orlais! She changed her voice to a deeper, more gravelly tone. Damn what the nobles think. I love you Sarah! I dont need their approval, Ive slain dragons! Tanith burst out laughing and took the book back off her.  They didnt really change the names like that did they? She said, hiccuping a little as her laughter hadnt fully subsided yet. She flipped to another page in the book. By Andrastes chastity belt they did. She jumped up. Darling, Im going to write a letter. Josephine needs to tell us who wrote this. I need an autograph for this masterpiece.

Josephine finished reading the letter and glared at her sister. I cant believe you submitted that to the Randy Dowager Quarterly! What am I supposed to say now? Hello Tanith, my sister wrote an erotic novel about you and *got it published*?! Her sister had the decency to look slightly ashamed. Josephine shook her head and went back to her writing desk, wracking her brains to come up with a good enough lie. Did they like it at least? Yvette asked. She was answered with another glare.",2018-06-02 15:49:41

After the sequence of hand movements, she pushes her hand outwards toward the door as it begins to slowly open.*

Before them, Therum would see open books scattered about all across the floor, papers and various sets of ink quills sitting next to each.

The books begin to form a pile upon a desk to clear the way, the various colored ink and quills gliding to a different smaller desk.*

628," Havent been successful yet, but Im reading the No Cry Sleep Solution and they suggest slowly decreasing the amount of time LO suckles. Basically, once they hit that fluttery phase but are still kinda awake, pull them off (but keep holding them) to let them finish falling asleep on their own. If they start getting upset, let them keep suckling and wait for them to get drowsy again. First you want them to get used to falling asleep without the boob in their mouth, and then you can decrease the amount of time they are nursing for! We are starting to try his this week. 

And remember, sleep associations are only a problem if they are a problem for you! So if you dont mind nursing to sleep, dont feel like you have to change what you are doing.

636,"Haggard  was a fat giant of a man. He towered over his students at nine 9feet tall. Hermione watched in awe as he guided his students  into the magical creature pen just outside his wooden hut.  

""Right, ladies! T'day we're gunna lern aboot Brarhead Hoonds! Tern to page 69 of yer textbooks!""  

There was a flutter of paper  as students opened their books.  A Japanese girl to Hermione's right raised her hand.  

""P-Professor? Do you mean, Braehead Hounds?"" 

""Aye, chinky,"" Haggard replied, ""Thas what I said - Brarhead Hoonds.""

There was a pause  as Haggard opened the gate. Two excited Braehead Hounds leapt and barked.

""Ahh need two 2volunteers!"" Haggard boomed.  

He scratched his beard and looked at the class before suddenly pointing at Hermione. 

""Whoremione! You'll do! And I need one more... Oy! Slanty eyes! You're up as well! Get in the pen!"" 

Hermione and the Japanese  girl stood up and stepped into the Braehead Hounds'  pen.

""Now, girls. These are magical creechurs. Yeh have to be be very careful because these are horny dogs! I'm gunna teach yeh how to handle them safely!""

Haggard then closed the gate and locked it shut.  

*Ring ring*    

""Aww shit, that's mah phone.  I'll be back faster than Congress  can impeach Trump.""    

Haggard wandered off, leaving the girls locked inside the wooden fence with the Hounds while the class watched.  Suddenly the Braehead Hounds  began to walk towards the girls!

""G-good d-doggy..."" the Japanese  girl whimpered, stepping back and raising open palms.   

Suddenly, one of the Hounds  leapt at her, knocking her onto her back. She landed on the ground, her schoolgirl skirt lifting up to reveal her panties. Hermione watched as the Japanese  girl's arms sank into the muddy earth.  She struggled to stand back up - but her arms were completely stuck! 

The Braehead Hound  wasted no time ploughing its snout  between her yellow thighs. It's sharp teeth quickly found her cotton panties and chewed them off, exposing her virgin pussy to the entire class!

""N-Noooo!"" she screamed.

Hermione panicked as the second Hound turned to face her. In a frantic flurry she made a dash  for the wooden fence. There was a small crack between the planks - maybe enough for Hermione to squeeze through. She could hear the Hound chasing her!

""Ah! Dammit!"" Hermione cried.

She had tried to dive through the gap, but she had only managed to get her upper half through the hole. She was stuck waist down in the pen. No matter how she struggled and wriggled, the little witch couldn't break free.

She frantically searched for her wand,  grabbing it from her cloak's pocket. As she lifted the magical stick to cast a spell it was snatched from her hand! 

""Sorry, does this belong to you, Whoremione?"" Muffloy jeered.

The Slither-in student had stolen her only defence against the Hound.

""Give that back!"" Hermione yelled.

""No, I think the class would rather watch what happens next, you filthy mudblood."" 

The Japanese  girl's arms were still stuck in the thick muddy soil. The Braehead Hound  had buried its head between her thighs now. Its long, wet  tongue  was repeatedly caressing her virgin slit, lapping up her teenage juices. 

""Ah! Ah! Ahhh! St-stooohhhhp! Ayaaaaahhhhhh!""

The Hound slurped and slobbered    at her cunt, its hot tongue  driving her  with unwanted pleasure. Her little clitoris  was burning with each graze of the beast's  talented muscle.  

""Oh!!! Ohhhhh! I'm cuuummmmmiing!"" she screamed, her body convulsing. 

She shook and thrashed near-uncontrollably. The unwanted orgasm rocked her body to its core. But the Hound  wasn't finished yet - it continued licking  even after she had finished.

""W-Wait! Ahhh! T-too sensitive!!!! Ooooohhhh! Ahhhhhhhh!!!""

Hermione was not having much luck  either. The second Hound had placed its paws upon her back in an attempt to mount her. It's hard, eight 8inch shaft was already pressing up against her tight vulva  through her panties. It thrust forward as hard as it could, but the elastic panties refused to yield. 

""Oh! Ah! Bad dog! Ah!"" Hermione gasped.

She struggled to break free and keep her composure in front of her class. If she could only last until Haggard came back...

*rrrrriiiipppp*

""AHHHHHHH!""

Hermione's panties suddenly snapped and eight inches of doggy dick plunged into her soaking wet pussy.   

She felt it fill up her body, stretching her cunt with its thick cock. Almost immediately it began to thrust in and out at an inhumanly quick pace. 

""Ah! Ah! Ah!"" 

Her moans came fast. Too fast. She could barely catch her breath.  She curled her toes  as the pleasure spread like a plague  throughout her body. With each thrust her big breasts   swung back and forth.

She clenched her hands  and banged her fists  against the fence. Her efforts were fruitless though - she was well and truly stuck.

The Japanese  student had cum four 4times now. Her little mind was going blank as the hound's  unceasing tongue  never stopped licking.

""Aaaahhh! Oh yes!! Yesss!!! I'm a little doggy slut!!! Lick  my pussy  !"" she hollered, another orgasm washing through her body.

Hermione felt something thick begin to swell within her pussy.  

""Oh look,"" Muffloy laughed, ""it's knotting Whoremione!""

The swelling pushed up and stretched her pussy, placing an immense pressure upon her quivering g-spot. This was enough to drive  her over the edge.

""Oh! Oh fuck! I'm cummming! Nooooooohhhhhhh!!!""

Hermione's body betrayed her as she came. Seconds later she heard the Hound howl.

""Arroooooo!""

""No! Don't cum inside me!""

Hermione knew that many of the magical creatures in Haggard's class could impregnate girls. Right now was a very dangerous time of the month for her!

She felt a hot, goopy fluid rush into the depths of her pussy  and flood into her fertile womb. The sensation was enough to send a second orgasm through her teenage body. Already, the Hound's sperm were swimming towards her teenage eggs , seeking to fertilise them. As the Braehead Hound  continued to cum, the cum began to leak  out of her pussy  and trickle down her thighs.

""Hahaha!"" the class roared in laughter at the two girls' plight. 

""Looks like Whoremione is going to be a pregnant slut now!"" Muffloy jeered, egging the crowd on.

""N-noooooo! Get me out of the fence! I- ahhh- I need to get the cum out! Ooooh!""

After five minutes of pumping her pussy  full of cum,  the Hound finally released her, leaving her lower half drenched in thick white semen.  The Japanese  girl wasn't faring any better. The Hound  had finally left her alone - but she was still quivering on the ground in the aftershock of twelve 12consecutive orgasms.

650,"I am a 48 M.  It is a shame that marketing has such a strong impact on all of us.  It affects what we think is and isn't sexy.  The truth is, what we are sold as sexy is actually very average.  Strong men and women learn to reject this.  They learn to embrace all the different types of individuals and are proud of all the varieties that are sexy to them. They also learn to be more confident in expressing their own selves and not being ashamed of who they are.  Now, all of this is easier said than done.  It is a process to work towards.  And all of us are affected to lesser or greater extents.

My opinion?  Evolution and biology takes care of such things.  Focus on being a little healthier and a little more confident.  This is general advice for ANYONE and is not to imply that you aren't healthy or that anything is wrong with you.  

Consider fashion models.  In the most common, biggest selling, and conservative clothing lines, marketers all too often play it safe by trying to sell their items in a very default, neutral, average looking model.  Others use models that look very unrealistic for almost all of us in an effort to highlight the clothing in some overly characterized way.  All of this has serious impacts on how we view ourselves.  While I believe it is a serious issue that men deal with, I also believe that it affects many women a lot more. 

When you step outside of conservative fashion, and look at many of the niche markets,  you start to see more and more models of various shapes and sizes.  I don't know if this really helps, but I want to share something: every single day I see how sex is used to sell products in magazines, tv, billboards, etc.  It looks so average, plastic, boring, sterile, etc.  It has this numbing effect of not being real.  On the other hand, when I see some of the alternative clothing companies using models that actually look like read women, my very first reaction in a heart flutter and a very intense attraction to the images.  I almost feel like I am looking at something x\-rated because, unlike all the marketing that surrounds and impacts us, I am being shown something that actually DOES appeal to my sense of what I find attractive.

I'm probably stumbling all over the place here.  What I'm really trying to say is women come in many different shapes and sizes.  \(This is exactly why mens' clothing is in one corner of the store while womens' clothing takes up 4 floors.\)  All of those shapes and sizes are very sexy.  And any and all men that have moved beyond the maturity of an insecure 14 year old boy, find all different sorts of women very attractive.  And not in SPITE of particular attributes, but BECAUSE of them.

Learn to be proud of your unique shape.  Hold your head up high.  Feel good about who you are and how you look.

p.s.  ever seen a burlesque show?  You will find REAL women of all different shapes and sizes.  And you see an appreciate and respectful audience who is sick and tired of the marketed kool aid that find actual FRUIT juice refreshing.  Stupid analogy, but I hope it helps.",2018-06-02 18:10:08

* Green Galaxy Clay Mask: HG mask. Clears up any blemishes or redness but doesn't dry out my skin.
* Milky Jelly Cleanser: HG cleanser. I've used up three bottles of this so far. Leaves my skin feeling hydrated but gets rid of my makeup easily.
* Priming Moisturizer: It's a very basic moisturizer that does it's job well. Wouldn't recommend for super dry skin, but great for normal/slightly oily/slightly dry/combo skin.
*Super Pure: Really lightweight serum that's helped with breakouts and generally lackluster skin days.
* Haloscope: Hated this at first, but realized I was using too much. It's a balm texture so overdoing it can leave your skin feeling tacky. It's gives a really natural, dewy highlight.

* Super Glow: I like the texture, but didn't feel like it did much.

Eloquent words leave her lips, seeking knowledge of my fruit, a proper lady she is not!


Brown eyes filled with pain and sadness, I want to heal them, but Pride keeps me out.


The blushing princess from the tower holding flowers in her hand, a gift for her bard.


A starry night I make her smile, melting the ice around her heart.


Soft lips and gentle fingers, petals parted by a magic touch.


Eyelids flutter when she sleeps, I wonder if she knows.


Watching over my Warden, keeping her safe.


She is my love, my light in the darkness.*

A dried Andrastes Grace lay in her lap, along with a lock of black hair held together by a dark red ribbon; gifts from the woman she loved. The poem was originally meant as a bit of fun, a way to keep her lovers spirits up during the last months of the Blight, but ten years later it had become a source of comfort to the bard, a memory of happier times. She missed Faustina so much.

661,"Music trickled back into Sachiko's ears as her eyes fluttered open. The jagged beat and the slick brass of the song slid forward as she did, stretching out her arms a bit from the cramped space behind her. She pulled lightly on her tricep, taking a quick look out the window while she did. Still in the clouds. A quick sigh escaped her lips as her arms fell back to her side- they must be circling now. With a simple click, her seat fell back to the Upright and locked position, and she took a quick swig of her water bottle to knock the grogginess from her system. The eclectic jazz faded out, with a more typical pop song coming up next. Must've been a crossplay from her running playlist. Sachiko skipped to something a bit more suitable- an American band called Death Grips. Not usually her style, but she wanted something rougher to wake her up. As the chiptune notes and the hard beats moved forward, she opened her phone to see how she looked. She still had another 4 hour flight from Seoul back to Tokyo, but Amane was waiting there for her and she wanted to look at least presentable. A quick look in her camera led to a long cringe from the Japanese Woman- her eyeliner was smudged, her hair was an absolute mess, and her roots were starting to show. 

""Note to self,"" she muttered, ""get the pink touched up before you go on a trip, not after."" She could fix the makeup, but the hair would have to wait. She took a quick look over to her aislemate, his eyes locked dead forward, with his body sort of slumped awkwardly over his seat. Maybe he's still asleep? Some weirdos could sleep with their eyes open, maybe he's one of them? Get Got ticked over into The Fever as the flight continued.

Sachicko awkwardly pulled on her jacket feeling around in her pocket for the ring she'd bought. It was there, unsurprisingly, though Sachi still let out a short sigh of relief. It was a simple ring- Brass with a Jade Gemstone laid on the center with an engraving on the outside. ""Anata Wa Ranu DMC o kiku?""- You listen to Run DMC? A bit of a dumb sentence, but they were the words that started a 4 year relationship, and they still meant a lot to her. She still wasn't sure how she was gonna tell her parents, but they'd been talking about getting married for about 3 months now, and they'd already booked the tickets down to New Zealand to get it done. Sachiko knew her parents liked Amane, but wasn't sure if they'd be ok with the marriage. It took them a looooong time to be ok with her dating women, so who knows how they'd react to this. Stillthough. Amane and Sachiko Nakamura, legally married, at least in New Zealand, if not Japan. She smiled a bit thinking of it. 4 songs had played by as she was lost in thought. Why hadn't they landed yet?

""Excuse me,"" she said as she lightly tapped the guy sitting next to her. ""Do you know how long it will be until we land? I have a flight to Tokyo in 2 hours and it's across the concourse.""

The man responded in Cantonese. Ugh. Why not just learn mandarin in this day and age? She stumbled through the little bit she picked up in Hong Kong to repeat the simple question. His response was 3 words, spoke slowly and deliberately. ""We aren't landing."" 

Sachiko asked him to repeat himself, which he did, in the same seemingly empty tone. She looked at his hands, which seemed white they's been gripping the seat for so long. She hit the button to call over a flight attendant, who hurried over with a look of odd panic on her face. ""I understand you want water,"" she said in hurried mandarin, ""But we don't have any.""

""Nihongo o hanashimasu ka?"" 

""E e, jibun ni eru,"" 

""Do you know why we haven't landed yet for christ sakes,"" Sachiko spat out in seemingly furious japanese. ""This moron seems to think we aren't""

The flight attendant's tone began to hush. ""We don't know when we'll be landing.""

""What, is there a wait for the runway in Seoul?"" 

""No. We don't know when we'll be landing Ma'am.""

""What does that mean?""

The flight attendant gained an element of that vacant stare the first man had, and she began to respond in English, same as he had. ""We aren't landing.""

""What the hell are you talking about, and why are you speaking english?"" she spat back in furious Japanese. ""We're in a plane. How can we not be landing?!?!"" The flight attendant repeated herself. ""We aren't landing."" Her eyes looked almost glazed over as she walked rigidly back to the front of the plane. 

Sachiko sat in her seat, jaw agape at what just happened. ""Ok fuck this, I'm gonna go ask the captain what's going on."" She unbuckled her seatbelt and started to stand when she felt a hand on her shoulder push her back down. ""Who the fuck..""

She looked behind her and saw the lady seated behind her, a nice dutch lady who she'd talked to on the way into the plane, with her hand on her shoulder. ""Stay seated, the fasten seatbelt sign is still illuminated."" 

""What?""

""Stay Seated. The Fasten Seatbelt sign is still illuminated."" Her eyes were glazed over as well. 

Sachiko shot back, ""What the fuck are you talking about, I'm going to talk to the captain you weirdo."" She pushed up from the seat, standing fully upright when the man in the seat next to her grabbed her by her arm and pulled her down. His blank eyes stared directly into hers. ""Stay Seated. The Fasten Seatbelt sign is still illuminated."" She could feel the force of his eyes boring into hers, his black pupils blank and cold as the expanse of space, seeming almost as if they stretched into the infinite. 

""I.... But I need to.."" The man kept his hand on hers, his grip tightening. Sachiko tried to pull free of him but his force was unwavering. Slowly, she descended back into her chair, and took another look outside the window. The cloud cover had lifted to reveal a blood red sky. She tried looking for the sun but could not find it along the horizon. The breathing of the passengers all of a sudden felt very heavy and very loud. She whipped her head around to see the breath materialize in front of her aislemate. Sachiko breathed out heavy but couldn't see hers. The fasten seatbelt sign came off, and like clockwork, the rows and rows of people stood, and walked to the front. Sachiko clutched her ring in her pocket, stood and followed suit...",2018-06-02 19:35:59

664,"I've only been using Flutter/Dart for a few days, but I have some first impressions about Dart compared to Kotlin (purely as languages and the tooling, not Flutter or the Android SDK):

- Dart has some odd quirks I don't really like. For example, the lack of access modifiers. I'm not really sure why they wouldn't include these in the language. THe whole `_` convention is kind of weird and an awkward workaround.

- Named parameters are done confusingly in Dart. Why not just allow any parameter (optional or not) to be accessed by name, without requiring the `{}` syntax? Kotlin approaches this much better, in my opinion. I see that there's even a `@required` annotation for named parameters.... if you're going to include that, why not fix named parameters altogether?

- The Dart plugin for IntelliJ is great given that it's a relatively young language, but it could use a lot of work. I'd love finer color scheme customization and the ability to enable/disable/tweak inspections via IntelliJ settings.

- Package management is much nicer in Dart, I really like how simple and easy it is.

- Factory constructors seem really useful.

- Doc comment syntax is really nice, and I love that it fully supports Markdown. Unfortunately, the quick-doc view in Android Studio/IntelliJ doesn't completely parse the markdown, e.g. links such as `[ListView]` don't turn into clickable links, they're just treated as regular text complete with brackets.

He reached a cloud, upon which was sitting a rather plump and very ugly woman.

No contest, thought the man, so he climbed the ladder to the next cloud. On this cloud was a slightly thinner woman, who was slightly easier on the eye.

""Have your way with me, Ill do anything you like, or climb the ladder to success,"" she said.

""Well,"" thought the man, ""might as well carry on.""

On the next cloud was an even more attractive lady who, this time, was quite attractive.

""Ill do anything you ask, and Ill be a faithful lover; or climb the ladder to success,"" she fluttered.

As he turned her down and went on up the ladder, the man thought to himself that this was getting better the further he went. On the next cloud was an absolute beauty. Slim, attractive, the lot.

""Fuck me now. I am yours forever, or as long as youll have me; or climb the ladder to success,"" she flirted.

Unable to imagine what could be waiting, and being a gambling man, he decided to climb again. When he reached the next cloud, there was a 400-pound ugly man, armpit hair showing, flies buzzing around his head and smelling of fish that has gone off.

The Krioth were ready for the arrival of the Meswoth warriors. Amidst the cold of the mountains, several bonfires were set up in the village alongside feasts. From above, in one of the cliff dwellings adorned with carved figures, the Twins stood out glimmering from their jewelry. They shimmered as they performed a ritualistic prayer to the moons and gods of the mountain, to give them a swift victory. In the meantime, the warriors were encouraged to mingle and eat with the Krioth. This was always encouraged with foreigners, as the Krioth always suffered casualties in the winters and needed foreigners as spouses and wives. Many a young girl fluttered their eyes at the warriors, and young boys inspected their weapons against the hunters. 

A man in his twenties lead a troop of about fifty warriors equipped with spears and their iconic stone maces to greet the Meswoth, ""Kagre welcomes Meswoth into village. It seems the Twins were able to convince you. Please, come and feast with us. Tomorrow we set off into the mountains and attack by nightfall."" 

Some of the men were murmuring a song under their breath. If any of the Meswoth ever attended a full-moon celebration (since they've always been invited), they would recognize it as the God Taunt - taunting the gods and to show their masculinity.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

The next day was a silent one. Kagre's band had been bolstered to around seventy total from other neighboring clans who had arrived late into the night, or early in the morning. The Twins awaited the group with their entourage of women to bless them and to take point in the sacred walk of the mountains. This time they were not taken on the shoulders of men, as it would be a great affront to the gods if they did not themselves walk the peaks.  

Yana and Dhozi curtsied with one hand deep in their mantle and spoke to the groups and onlookers, ""Today we set off to put down the heretics. Judgement will be swift, as was foretold by the gods. We thank our brethren, the Meswoth, for joining us.""

Deep in the mountains, in the Sune Lodge, Hodze set in the middle of hundreds of silent men and women encircling him. They sat quietly with their heads down, and Hodze mumbled. Earlier that day, a young scout had come running to him, letting him know that the lowlanders had bolstered the Twin's numbers, and they were sure to advance soon. Their hubris would be tested by the frozen mountains if they chose to attack now, but it would still mean the dead of young men following him. Doubt plagued him; perhaps it was better to stand down and spare the lives of those here? Yet, resolve spewed from the men and women around him. They all believed in what kept them in the mountains, they all believed in their origins. Hodze knew they wouldn't stand down, and it was best if he lead them.

Still, it plagued him to know that they were not yet ready to defend, and if the Twin's did indeed attack, the victim lodge would have to fend for themselves.

##Meanwhile, south of the Sune Peaks, in the Umra Lodge

Nightfall came early, and the biting cold with it. The howls of wolves and owls dotted the soundtrack of the night, masking the footsteps that approached. More than a few guards stood at the foot of the caves, and high above the mountain more scouts stood in attention. They had been warned of the Twin's approach, but they themselves had not received reinforcements. They couldn't. The Lodgers were already struggling to survive the winter, even with the aid of the Seyirvaes.  They had to fend for themselves. This shouldn't be intimidating for the Lodgers themselves, as that was always the way it had been, but now many of the men were housing their wives and children amidst the caves. If they failed, it surely spelled death for their families. 

&nbsp;

Then, one of the scouts atop the mountain gurgled blood. His throat had been slit, and the body hurled down to bounce off the rocky walls. The guards at the mouth of the caves stood in shock upon seeing the gelatinous body of their comrade splatter down, until one came to their senses and began beating the wooden pipes that lined the caverns to signal danger, but by the time he finished, the Twins' warriors had come out of the darkness and fighting ensued.

Black flies swarming about drawn to the sweat of beast and man, nights woken by sourceless cackles near and distant under a pale moon, a white face with features indefinite and disinterested and static.

All along to Nightsong, of a harsh land. It sat as an stone crown on its great hill, above the greening canopy and above the smoking, busy foothills village and above the lower ringwall and above the tall golden grasses and red earth. Wind whistled and brought dust hereabouts dancing mindless in whorls. The red mountains backlit the perimeter even many miles distant. 

Up the road against them rode porters and laborers, lopsing carts and sneezing mules whose ears batted away the flies, all flanked by men who rode horses and wore weapons to protect the train. This was work headed towards the ruined village of Saddler of the extincted line of Ashley, burned by Bulwer in the winter war. This was an ongoing operation to rebuild and resettle the displaced of Saddler; families torn and scattered, with a great many clamoring for sanctuary and work around the titan fortress of Nightsong. The displaced had gathered there years ago, some skilled and earlier arrivals residing within the lower walls, and other less fortunate along the outer walls and clustered ramshackle about the lower gates like crust on a blood clot. 

It was a dry place, and noisy, with beggared orphans and disorganization. As the visitors closed upon the lower gate, the children knew better than to beg them for aid and so the troop was given freedom of movement. Dogs barked, and fowl honked and ran about. Above a heavy portcullisthe first of twoa mans voice cried down at them. 

Apple of Fossoway, he said, a somewhere above with a gaggle of helmet faces appearing between the granite crenels. What brings this company to the Singing Towers?

Loud banners of black-on-gold nightingales fluttered in the dry winds all along the lower walls, and the banners by the gatehouse flew a series of banners beneath them the maelstrom of the Rain House, the sea turtle of a noble house off the coast of Cape Wrath, a two headed horse than ran in opposite directions, and the bowed centaur of Bitterbridge.

This isn't the greatest song of all time, because Have One On Me is the greatest song of all time. \(Or maybe A Postcard To Nina\). But there are no musical experiences more magical and transportative than listening to Emily by Joanna Newsom. Listening to this song is like going on holiday to your childhood, via a superior, aestheticised Other childhood, via space. There is no cynicism in this song. There is only love; love for her sister, love for her father, love for the universe which birthed her. The ""And Emily,"" chorus is a triumph in songwriting imo. It's more like an impressionist painting than mere words, she creates a perfectly clear sense of texture, colour, mood, subtext. Best song in the rate for me, but I'm happy with #2.

687,"TL;DR I had to understand the reactive way of building UIs to learn Flutter first.

Two years ago, when Flutter was in alpha I used it for the first time. I didn't like it at all. I was used to Android layout system, its architectural patterns and also the imperative way of building UIs, so I didn't understand how developing apps with Flutter worked.

Later I was investigating about cross platform frameworks and stumbled upon React Native. And thanks to it, I learned the React way. I understood how to write reactive views, and then, when Flutter released the first beta, I understood how to do it in Flutter. It went so smooth.

In order to learn Flutter, one must understand the reactive paradigm. I don't know of any Flutter documentation that tackles that, but if there were something like the React examples but for Flutter, that would be great. However, you can visit Awesome Flutter (https://github.com/Solido/awesome-flutter) for tutorials and docs, I think they are plenty to get started.",2018-06-02 21:57:42

Like it doesn't have to be new and revolutionary but just as long as you can show that you're able to apply some of the things you know. I think I have an idea of what I want to do, but does anyone have any tips for this?

This and learning a new language can go hand in hand. I would recommend looking up a framework tutorial video that will help you make a small web application. Since you're pretty familiar with Python, try watching videos on Flask or Django \(TheNewBoston has awesome tutorials on this!\). 

\>**Leetcode**: I haven't really taken a look into this yet but I heard these are good questions to solve? Are there any real ""tips"" for this? Do I upload these to GitHub and kinda show I can do these?

Work on the ""Easy"" and ""Medium"" problems. Try to solve it for at least 30 minutes without looking at the solutions and if you're stuck, then look at the solution and come back to it again in a few days. Try to identify patterns! Do not upload it to GitHub, these problems are so trivial that no one would really care and it would honestly look really tacky. You show that you can do these in your technical interviews.

\>**Github**: I kinda touched on this during INF43 but honestly I barely know much about this. Can I upload my school projects? Do I put the Leetcode and personal projects on here?

Most professors are not too inclined on you uploading your school projects that everyone has to do on GitHub. Only upload personal projects/unique group projects/etc...

  
\>**Books to read:** I remember seeing somewhere that there were a few good reads that'll help with interviews? I think one of them was* Cracking the Coding Intervie*w but I feel like there were others that I forgot about... I thought I saved whatever post it was somewhere but I couldn't pull it up again.

CTCI is fine to brush up on your fundamentals. I never really used it personally and relied on LeetCode mainly, but if I had to choose a book, it'd be this one!

\>**Prepping for an internship**: What things, besides reading those books and doing a personal project, could I do to get an edge on getting one? I understand the career fair and most apps are during fall quarter so I wanna get shit done over the summer.

In short, browse r/cscareerquestions, but don't let it discourage you.

\>**Languages to Learn**: I currently know Python \(ICS 3x series\), C\+\+ \(ICS 45C & 46\), and Java \(ICS 45J\) but not much else... I wanted to take that Flutter course offering by Google \(which is written in Dart?\) and maybe front\-end languages \(JavaScript, CSS, HTML\) but again I'm a little lost in terms of where I should be looking or investing into.

JavaScript is a great language to learn, but I would definitely pair it up with a framework so you can make something cool :\) Try looking into Ruby On Rails, React, NodeJS, etc.. Those are pretty hot frameworks right now and would look good on your resume.

692,"It is raining. The world is a gray mass of fluctuating mathematical curves which seems to recede into the early evening silence. Silent, because your spontaneous and often ridiculous lover is nowhere to be found. Which means of course that he is in the basement.

You love when it rains because thats when Tony seems to be at his most productive. He practically locks himself away in the lower levels of his mansion and becomes a hermit for the day. You enjoy the solitude because it lets you do something you rarely ever do: read. Tony isnt much of a reader and happens to be an attention whore, so you dont get much time to yourself. But even you have to admit that hours of reading can get a little bit boring. Which is why you end up trailing down the stairs that lead you to someone who doesnt know what boredom is.

Tony is bent over one of his many computers when you enter. The doors swish open so quietly that you doubt he even realizes youre there. But after a moment of staring, he tilts his head upwards and gives you a boyish smirk. You missed me, didnt you? he asks, sounding sort of boastful, like hed known this would happen all along.

You smirk right back and say, Course not. Just felt like going for a walk. And his smirk widens because youre so obviously lying through your teeth and you both know it.

Oh really? he muses, turning back to his computer. Well unfortunately I cant entertain you, Im busy. He does look busy. He even has that mussed up hairstyle that he always gets when hes in the throes of discovery.

You shrug and walk forward, sauntering up behind him and looking down at his computer. Some weird complicated looking mathematical formula are scrawled over the blue screen in his messy handwriting.

Thats fine, you tell him after a moment of trying and failing to figure out what the hell hes doing. Instead you merely pull your fingers through that mussed up hair and mess it up even more. He doesnt appear to mind  in fact he leans back and tilts his head up just a little. Scalp massages always work. You smile and murmur, Im sure I can amuse myself somehow. And the low scrap of your voice makes him sigh out and chuckle.

Is that what youre after? Didnt I already fulfill my dutiful obligation this morning? he leans back even more to glance up at your face, his smile a strange mixture of cheek and suave charm. You merely raise your eyebrows and scrap your fingertips lightly over his scalp, watching his eyes flutter. A moment of serene staring on your part offers up the realization that you very much like the way his neck is angled in that moment, and so you lean down to kiss his adams apple very gently. He swallows immediately after and you watch the cords of his throat fluctuate and ripple.

Mmm he sighs when you do it again, this time kissing the hollow his throat. Your fingers drift down to part the collar of his shirt, shifting over the dark hairs that are patterned over his chest.

Youre being strangely provocative today, he muses a moment later, then hurries to add, Not that thats bad of course. The smile he sends you is more like an angelic smirk that shares a border with wicked amazing insanity. Insanity that goes straight to your head.

Guess Im just hoping youll cure my boredom, you tell him cheekily, pulling away just slightly. He doesnt move even an inch as your lips softly capture his, and doesnt immediately kiss back either. Instead your mouth gently pulls against his, and after a long moment of this you nip at his bottom lip in an attempt to encourage a response. He only smiles and finally returns the kiss, but barely.",2018-06-02 22:30:58

696,"Here are the major differences I know of:

- Swift and Kotlin both have stronger (and arguably more flexible) type systems. In particular, Dart doesn't have null safety, and it doesn't support anything like union types (like Swift's enums or Kotlin's sealed classes).
- Kotlin really blurs the line between expressions and statements. Neither Swift or Dart really have anything comparable.
- Swift's compile times can be kind of long.
- Kotlin has the advantage of being able to use the entire Java ecosystem.
- Dart has the advantage of being able to easily share code between mobile and web (Kotlin kind of does this too, but it's not as mature).
- Dart is the only one that has code generation as part of its integrated build system. Swift doesn't support this at all (at least for now), and Kotlin has no official build system (though Gradle is close enough).
- Dart has the most mature target platforms. It runs on Android/iOS (via Flutter), web, and desktop (though desktop GUI applications aren't really a thing yet). Swift only runs on iOS, macOS, Linux (with smaller community support), and Windows (with very little community support). Kotlin runs on desktop (via the JVM or the relatively young Kotlin Native; the latter has little community support), web (via the JS backend; this seems to have more community support), Android (via ART), and iOS (via Kotlin Native). IMO it's a bit of a disadvantage for Kotlin that you're using two different backends for Android and iOS.
- Many Dart libraries don't support Dart 2.0 yet. Kotlin hasn't really had any major breaking changes thus far, and Swift's community gets over them surprisingly well.",2018-06-02 22:59:51

698,"[](/abhuh) So if I'm getting this right, according to this episode the School of Friendship teaches friendship and not much else. Huh. So it's like some of our *madrasah*s here that teach only Islamic subjects plus Malay and History for SPM qualifications but not much else? I'm not completely certain of all the ins and outs of Equestrian society, but I don't think that kind of curriculum would endow them with enough knowledge to carry on into society. Even the *madrasah*s, many of them have included STEM subjects so that their student could go through many different paths later on (which comes with the significant drawback of having the students learn 20-odd subjects, along with memorizing all 6,236 verses that make up the Quran, and then some hadiths too).

[](/abbored) Though with that said Equestria isn't a 1:1 recreation of our world in ponies, and friendship *is* magic there, so maybe you could get somewhere in life with just friendship. Heck, now that I think of it, Starlight was never stated to get much of a formal education, innit? The only time she's in education was under Twilight. Now she secured herself an alright career in the School.

^(And now that I said that, I just realized: students who graduated *madrasah*s in the past, a number of them ended up teaching at *madrasah*s, so like, is this School of Friendship only going to produce future teachers for the School in a self-sustaining loop? Oh dear.)

[](/goodjob) Speaking of Starlight, it's about time we have interaction between her and the CMC. And now she'll be working with them, like... in a professional environment, I guess? Is this a paid occupation? Does the CMC now have an actual *career* with *income*? I'm 20 and living off student loans; these buggers got jobs under the bloody monarch! They're starting at, like, a TA level -- at these rate, they're gonna have full classes for themselves before the artists at DHX remake their character models from fillies to mares.

Excuse me, where was I? I look forward to seeing how Starlight and the CMC would work together.

[](/flutternice) I like Cozy Glow. She's nice. The moment I figured out why she's failing, it got an audible ""Aww. Oh, that's nice of her!"" I'm not sure how much of a role she'll play in later episodes or how her interactions with the CMC will work out for here, but we'll see. She seems to quite have some character of her own; she comes across as mildly emotional to me. I hope she wouldn't be like what's-his-name from that episode with Kettle Corn, who's just there to drive the plot.

[](/fluttershh) The first character that came to my mind seeing Cozy Glow, however, is Gideon from the late Gravity Falls. Maybe it's the style of talking, or her designs -- it's probably her cheeks with the dotty-thingy -- or both. In fact, that name sounds familiar, ""Cozy Glow""? I think I heard it before from this subreddit, too. I'll go check on that later.

[](/absmile) Overall, the episode's alright -- a good penultimate to this half-season. If there's just one qualm I have, it's that I feel like any of Starlight's role in here could've easily be done by Twilight, but other than that I'm okay with it.

701,"I also own a 4 input interface, I will one day expand with a 8 input ADAT but really dont need to. 

The most important part that is too often overlooked is drum placement inside the room. Most people will set the drum in the corner because it takes a lot of space and thats where it leaves more room to move around but acoustically speaking, this is the worst spot ever to record. Of course if you want to set your drum and make it available to jam/practice at any time, its okay, perfect sound isnt a priority at all times. 

If you put your drums in a rectangle room, try to place it somewhere around 35~45% the lenght of that room away from the back wall and center the kick and snare in between the side walls. Sorry if my explanations are weak, english isnt my native language. But anyway, you need to put your drums so that the center of the kick and the snare make a line that divides the room in 2. This is usually the right mathematically speaking spot to record and avoid most standing waves, flutter, etc. Of course, youll get bonus points if your room has proper acoustic treatment. (If you are thinking egg crates, please stop right now and read about real acoustics because that is the worst idea ever)

For the mics, dont listen to ANYONE who will tell you that you HAVE to use THIS mic for THIS purpose.. You are allowed to experiment and play and I encourage you to do so... Of course there are mics that have better reputation than others but that doesnt mean you cant achieve professional results with cheap stuff... 

This is an example of a setup I like to do :

Kick : SM7B (placement is key, I suggest you look at youtube videos on kick drum mic placement) 

Snare : SM57 / Blue Spark / CAD SN mic (those are what works best for me in my toolbox, of course Im lucky enough to own an Antelope interface so I can chose from a very wide selection of coloured preamps, eqs and comps and that makes any mic stand out, really, preamps are almost as important as the mic itself) same thing as kick, look at tutorials but dont forget that ideally youd have a top AND bottom mic but in our case thats not possible so when you place your mic on top, make sure that whatever you do, aim that mic towards the mesh under if you want to get some of that or else you get the ping ping without the shhh shhh

Overheads : Im lucky to own an Antelope ecosystem cause with a pair of Verge microphones, I can get the sound of a wide selection of small condenser mics without the need for having a collection of them. But of course, whatever condenser mic you have will do, I suggest using the good old XY mic placement. The most important is to place the mics above your head and set them so that the stereo image splits on the same imaginary line I talked about when I talked about drum placement so that your left and right mics are forming an X at an equal distance from left and right walls and that both your kick and snare stays in the center of the stereo image, meaning that the angle of the X formed by your mics need to be set so both mics have an equal angle with the center line of the room.  

But you know, if theres one thing that I know for sure that I really dont doubt, its that I dont know a lot according to the size of the universe vs what my senses get...

706,"Rarity is a mess of wasted potential. Her key early character motivation was to make it big in the fashion industry, and now that shes moved away from that, her character is boring and directionless. When was the last time her fashion career was about her, and not someone else, like Applejack or Fluttershy? Shes stagnated, and you know it.

And her characterization? Its even worse, she used to be amusing with her constant drama breakdowns, now shes level headed and boring, outdoing AJ with her practicability. How could you possible find this character who has deviated so strongly from her true person to be an example of good writing?

That feeling you have after reading that? Yeah, thats what you should be feeling. But heres the thing: even though I love Rarity and dont believe a word of what I just wrote, its just as true as your opinion on Starlight. Because arguments based on opinions are never right or wrong, only varying levels of popular.

Theres two problems with your argument about Starlight:

One, it doesnt understand characters or characterization. A character that is only ever one thing isnt a character, its a caricature. In just the same way you would rebel against the idea that Rarity is boring if she isnt throwing a drama fit, Starlight fans rebel against the idea that she has to be Full On, Shoot Mordin In the Back, Renegade all the time in order to be entertaining. The most consistent part of her character has always been her anxiety and social cluelessness, and those are usually the key contributor behind her actions. To call episodes that focus on those parts of her character wasted potential is absurd.

And two, its just your opinion. And ironically you aided my argument for me. You know another character that was considered mediocre at best, painfully redundant, and just caused unnecessary drama in the fandom? Rarity. From season one to season four, Rarity was the whipping girl of the fandom, her constant drama, self-centered ness and constantly putting herself before others made her ridiculed and hated. No other main six was hounded over not matching their element like Rarity was in the first three seasons. Why do you think that she shouldnt even be in the journal joke was in Fame and Misfortune?

So for someone whos been a part of the fandom since season two, a Rarity fan making this kind of statement is just deliciously entertaining irony.

But really, the biggest problem is that you would actually make a dedicated post, just to pass off a negative opinion of a character. Guess what, everyone has those kinds of opinions, if we all just decided to point out all the ways characters havent gone the way we wanted them to, the mods would have to make rules against the kinds of post you were writing up, or the toxicity and whining levels on the sub would go through the roof. The idea that its worth talking about a character writing not solely focusing on the parts of the character you like and that it amounts to wasted potential, is an embarrassing one. Because these kinds of opinions are just that, opinions, and anybody can have any opinion they want.

The point of this isnt to say Rarity sucks, it to try and point out how meaningless these kinds of arguments are, and how harping about your opinions doesnt do anything helpful.",2018-06-02 23:51:56

711,"So the silent mysterious type? This sounds exactly like my type in high school, back when I was a dorky teen with low self esteem I would always get crushes on that one guy who would always be alone or the quietest one within a group of people, given that I already found physically attractive of course.The thing about the quiet guy is that you can plaster over any sort of romantic fantasy you want on him.

He could be dark and brooding.

He could be a closet romantic.

He could be observant and pensive.

Or really funny and nice but just too shy to show it.

It's the ultimate fantasy for the shy and awkward because you get to dream about being the one to open them up and find out. 'He's always so lonely, maybe I should keep him company' \*flutters eyelashes\*,ugh.

Men in large groups can often come off as intimidating and, sorry, a bit boorish, so when women see a man not participating in this like other men we find it interesting, some of us find it more interesting than others. But just because a guy isn't as out going or doesn't have many friends doesn't mean he isn't a lad or doesn't do ""dumb guy stuff"" from time to time, it doesn't mean he's particularly smart or deep. I learned this the hard way, guys like that are just people. ",2018-06-03 00:49:35

Y.i! Yu! Stay...wit...me! YURI!

*I can hear...someone. Theyre calling for me. My eyes slowly flutter open. My eyes attempt to focus. I can see him...MC...but why does he look so frightened. I look down and notice something wooden. I instinctively try to raise my hand to it but my arms dont seem to want to move. I glance over and notice my hand is resting in a pool of blood. The memories of what happened rush back to me.*

*I...I did this. I look up from my bloodied hand to the blood that currently stains my uniform. Deep patches of crimson bleed through the fabric and pool on the floor next to me. I can feel MCs hands applying pressure to my abdomen attempting to stop the bleeding. Tears stream down his face as his panicked gaze bounces from my eyes, to the wound and back.*

Itll be ok Yuri. Help is on the way. Just hang on. *I can hear the fear and apprehension in his voice. I attempt to take a breath in but every breath feels like fire and glass entering my lungs. The familiar taste coppery taste of blood dances on my taste buds. With every labored beat of my heart, I can feel myself growing weaker. I look to MC. My beloved MC. How I wish things could have turned out differently for the two of us. How I wished that dream could have been our reality.*

MC I weakly choke out.

*I can hear the sound of sirens from outside the school.*

Save your strength Yuri. Helps here. Itll be ok.

*I feel MC take my bloodied hand into his. Such a tender, loving touch he has. I feel trails of tears stream down my face as I gaze into the eyes of my beloved. He really was there for me, even until the bitter end, he stay with me.*

MC...I. *I can hear the sounds of voices making their ways into the school now.*

...I...love you.

*Through his tears, he smiles at me.*

I love you too Yuri.

*Ah, to finally be able to hear him say those words. To finally hear him reciprocate my love for him. I am so happy.*

MC...its...so...c..o...l

MCs eyes grow wide as the EMTs enter the classroom. One of them pulls him away as the rest try to bring back Yuri. One of the EMTs looks back at the others and then to MC.

724,"Whew, that was close. For a second there I thought you were **actually** making a case against Rarity and I panicked! I know you're being facetious and just using her as an example, but even if we ignore the recent seasons and only look at the very beginning, the nature of Rarity criticism is so incomparable with Starlight on a fundamental level that it's dishonest to try and compare the two despite you and I personally disagreeing with it . Especially as a reference point to essentially say what I feel is completely meaningless and in a fanbase already filled to the brim with critique of that very character, trying (And ultimately choosing not to) to see if people agree is a waste of time and unhelpful so I should just say nothing about the thing I dislike, even though plenty of people agree with my side. She's a controversial topic for a reason.

[I've gone back and scoured old Rarity criticisms obsessively, I know how stupid they can get.](https://derpicdn.net/img/view/2014/8/31/711649.png) But in reality it all comes down to people simply not liking her personality. Nothing more. You'd be **extremely** hard-pressed to find anyone who takes issue with Rarity for reasons outside her personality.  That's not the case with Starlight. People despise Starlight for every reason under the sun! If someone tried to hold those types of arguments to Rarity, they'd fall flat on their face because Rarity straight up does not have a writing problem in the same vein as Starlight. A better comparison to Starlight would be Twilight or Fluttershy.

Why I say wasted potential is because of the sheer speed they're blowing through things. What could be an established part of her identity and what could have been an interesting angle had they elaborated on it and keep it as a permanent character trait, was dropped like a rock. Hard.

* *Evil actions as a dictator?* She'll get over it, heck she'll joke about it indefinitely!

* *Conflict with Sunburst?* Solved the very next episode and only touched on once more after that but they cool as if nothing ever happened between them.

* *Backstory?* All good. 

* *Skilled with magic?* Psst of course she's powerful should we why explain that.

* *Abuses spells on others?* Only happened once, the other time it worked out perfectly.

* *Social anxiety?* Nope, she's amazing at making friends and talking to others and does it constantly. 

* *Fear of disappointing her teacher?* Finished plotline. 

* *Surpassing her teacher?* She'll pass out correct advice left and right as if she is a reasonable person who'd never make the wrong call.

* *Redeeming herself to both the village and herself?* Done. 

* *Anger issues?* Only when someone was already bothering her, she'll never just snap like a former villain would. And for about 5 seconds before going back to niceness.

* *Branching out and doing her own thing?* Ehhhhh, I guess she's a friendship student oh wait no ehhhh I guess she's called by the map now oh wait no she a counselor now ehhh just hang around Twilight for a bit.

* *The villainous attitude that was the only interesting aspect that made her stand out?* Erased. From. Canon.

I want you to look at those hypothetical questions I asked myself. Do you in all seriousness truly believe those are unfinished plotlines and are potential episode concepts to work with going forward? Do you honestly think the show can go back to any of these topics because there's a loose end somewhere? Are these issues vague enough to try again from another angle? Do you not see the problem with introducing a Starlight problem and resolving it to satisfaction within a day?

The point I'm trying to make is that on a surface level, all the main cast have things that are unresolved. The mane cast has vague and undefined reasons to play around. Things the writers can elaborate on to whatever level of importance they so choose. Starlight does not have this luxury. She **had** them. But she solved them. All of them. Quickly. That's why she's a disappointment to me! That's why she's a waste of potential! That's why she's controversial with fans! The problem runs deeper than misunderstanding her character.

Look, I wouldn't care either way if she was Shadow the Hedgehog level edgy or a pure white friendship saint like she debatably is now but what I want is for her day to day, dialogue line to dialogue lines to be entertaining in some way on it's own! I mean for Pete's sake, take a look at this very thread! Look at all the people **complementing** Starlight and think about what they're saying from an outsider's perspective! Starlight had like 5 lines total, made a silly reaction face, only appeared at the very end, didn't do anything special except her job description as councilor, had 1 or 2 decent jokes, and yet people are showering her with praise! And for what? Finally being as interesting as anyone else for a change? The hard fact is that if she was as consistently good as the mane 6, this event would not be noteworthy in the slightest. If it was anypony else, no one would bat an eye at this scene. 

I already know it's all just opinion. But the fact that Starlight is such a controversial character is a testament to the underlying issues with her characterization. If we could chalk it up to opinion and say the arguments are pointless or if other characters were written like her, then **all** the characters would face the same level of scrutiny. But they don't. Never to this level. It's just Starlight. I want to like Starlight, I do like Starlight, but what they're giving out is not enough. Social anxiety (Which she does not have) is not interesting and it will never be interesting unless they actually focus on it. You know, in a way Twilight, Applejack, RD, Fluttershy, Rarity, Spike, Luna, Wallflower, Sunset, and especially the one pony who did anxiety better in one appearance than she's ever had, my main man Zephyr Breeze haven't already done before! The full extent of that ""Anxiety"" is her feeling sad for a bit, and laughing nervously a little. I could analysize her character and get a solid opinion on her, but why should I care if I'm confident she'll drop the anxiety shtick sooner or later or never reference it unless it's for a joke?

If they give me a reason, I will care. They haven't, so I don't. It's like I said to Jester earlier today, you have to **try** to like Starlight. You have to put in unnecessary effort into liking a character like hers because the moment you put her under a microscope, one of two things will happen as a fan. You either try to justify all the questionable decisions and relate to her, or you take the other extreme and say it sucks.

-----

Sorry for the long post and my passive-aggressiveness, but you're coming off to me as ""Shut up, people have opinions"" when let's be real here, we both know it's only because the topic is Starlight. I highly doubt you'd be singing the same tune of asking to keep negative posts to yourself if someone was criticising another pony. Like dude, what does this
>Because arguments based on opinions are never right or wrong, only varying levels of popular.

and this

>The point of this isnt to say Rarity sucks, it to try and point out how meaningless these kinds of arguments are, and how harping about your opinions doesnt do anything helpful.

741,"I don't know what the hell in wrong with me.. 

My heart keeps getting random fluttering or having palpations the last two nights. The first night it went on for a bit but stopped, then tonight started again. The first night I thought it was from chugging a Mountain Dew in like ten minutes at work (started 3ish hours after), especially since I'm seriously not supposed to drink caffeine (intolerant to caffeine).

Today, I wake up fine. Accident bought a Coke and drank it (forgot), this time slowly throughout the day. Fine the whole day, just really burpy and like something is kind of on my chest, but goes away after the burp. Tonight, like every night, I take my multiple Tylenol PMs to sleep and the fluttering/palpations happen again. 

Like an hour or so later I'm shaking for the cold, so badly I wanted to scream, before turning off my fan. Then later I got nauseous, extremely hot and threw up *everything* in my stomach. 

This has never happened before with my pills.. however I do, honestly, take a lot of them (7-8, yes I know it's fucking stupid) and I'm currently defating my liver (I have an eating disorder). 

I don't know what's going on.. it's no where close to the first night but still. And the palpations honestly seem to stop after my pills wear off or after I vomited them up. My heart beat isn't fast or slow at all, it just.. skips (?). I can't tell if it's the caffeine and this is like an allergic kind of reaction or something is really wrong.. 

I've also been taking 4ish Advil at work due to migraines. The first night I did and this happened, tonight I didn't take any Advil and this is still happening.

I don't know what's wrong.. at all. I'm 19 and terrified, which only stressed my heart out more.

743,"THIS STORY IS 100&#37; TRUE and the VERY FIRST TIME I SHARE IT:

I met him in Polo\-sci 101. I was a freshman, first time away from home and my hormones were raging. Although I am a straight\-card\-carrying\-male; I have also always been sexually adventurous and open\-minded. I guess I'm BI if you want to put it bluntly but at this time I did not know this. 

He was very nice, clean\-cut, taller than me. We got to talking one day and I mentioned how I was looking for a side\-gig. Happens he was a manager at a clothing store and could put a good word for me. Great! He asked me to lunch to talk it over. 

At lunch we got to know each other. Told me he was into photography. Asked me about myself and what I enjoy doing. I'm clueless \(as I usually am\) that their is any kind of sexual tension between us. I don't assume hes bi or gay I'm just making a new friend. He asked me if I'd like to be his test subject and take a few shots with his new camera. ""It will only take a second."" That sounded like fun besides this dude is going to get me a job, so we go back to my dorm room. The dorm was a mini apartment with 2 bedrooms. I had 2 other roommates who weren't home, so I had a bedroom to myself. 

Snapping away he takes a few shots and like the pro he is, tells me how to pose. He suggests I change clothes, I'm game. He's saying all the right things and I'm feeling good so I decide to take a few, shirt\-half\-open pics, which turns into my shirt is off, which turns into my pants are off and I'm now letting him photograph me in my underwear. He asked me to lower my underwear and I'm like, ""I dunno, what if my roommates come home?"" 

I lower my underwear and can see he is salivating at the mouth. This is when I first realize he may be gay. I know, I'm CLUELESS! I'm also very horny and very nervous, I hook\-up with girls, what am I doing? It made me feel incredible hot and confused. As your average looking Joe, not many people LUST after me and this was turning me on. Next thing you know my cock is out and I'm just stroking it, out of habit. He tells me I'm not hard enough for the photo. ""So what do we do?"" I ask. He gestures for me to come by him. I walk on over, and just put my half\-hard cock is his waiting mouth. I literally let go and just let him do what he needed to do. He just ate me up, slurping and moaning and getting lost on the head of my dick. His hot mouth and moans made my dick rock\-hard and I just put my hands on my hips and watched him suck me. His head bobbing up and down and chills ran down my back. He grabbed onto my bare\-ass to get a good grip and push my cock deeper into this throat until I was just fucking his mouth. It was pure lust, it was ecstasy.   

After a while I laid on the bed not giving a fuck if one of my roommates caught me. Just as quickly as I did his lips were wrapped around my cock again. He couldn't get enough. At one point he muttered, ""My boyfriend would love you,"" and just continued blowing me. I'm in a trance, my eyes are rolling into the back of my head as this guy I only met a few hours ago is slobbering all over my cock. I look up long enough to warn him that if he keeps doing that with his tongue I'm going to explode in his mouth. He lets out a real good moan and starts fluttering his tongue against my dick as he strokes me up and down. His groans and moans push me into the point of no return. ll never forget him staring into my eyes as I came so very hard in his hot mouth. He just held my dick calmly in his mouth as I pulsated and shot more and more semen down his throat. After I was done, he just continued to blow me softly, making sure he got every last drop. It was bliss. 

I was exhausted. He got up, wiped his mouth and told me to give him a call about the job.

744,"Depends on the definition of native. You could argue any app which is in the app store is native if you wanted to since even a webview is a native widget.

From my understanding without having tried any: phonegap = webview with bridge to native services. React native = Javascript run time with bridge to native widgets. Flutter = Canvas with custom rendering engine.

I think when people call these non-native they just mean that there's a performance hit due to bridges etc., where as if you wrote an app as intended by Google/Apple you would see better performance (if written to right way at least).",2018-06-03 06:34:37

Regarding finding insects. Currently it's the beginning of June. This is prime time to be catching insects as it's still relatively early in the season. So there's no problems there. Unless you get a snap freeze or suddenly become as warm as Phoenix, AZ, the temperatures should be just fine from now until the fall.

Regarding places to catch insects, just about anywhere should work. You will certainly find more insects in some places than others, but just about any natural area will have plenty to find. I would suggest looking for insects in a range of habitats. Woods, prairie, lawns, bare soil/sand, gardens, near bodies of water like rivers/ponds/lakes, these are all great places with different specimens to be found though many may have overlap of what's to be found. If you want to get a little nasty, looking at trash/dead animals/rotting plants (like wasted vegetables) will also yield insects, but I can understand taking a pass here.

Consider simply looking under things too. Overturning rocks, logs, and digging through debris on the ground (like leaf litter, or heavy vegetation) will also yield insects scurrying about. If you have really old decayed logs around, consider ripping some of these open and you can probably find some beetle larvae, if not several adult beetles, otherwise checking underneath the bark of fallen tree parts is also a favored location for beetles.

Read on for collecting info.

The nice thing about collecting insects is that many ways to trap/catch insects can be done with easy to obtain items. You almost don't need to order anything, especially if you have some supplies on hand. However, it is easier to buy something than to make it yourself if you're strapped for time. If you're looking to buy things outright, I've used [BioQuip](https://www.bioquip.com/) in the past for getting my basics, like pinning items and purchasing a net. Despite the design of the site looking like it never progressed beyond the year 2000, it's a reputable business. Hopefully other's can chime in here if they've purchased equipment from elsewhere as this is the only suggestion I have at the moment.

As for doing things on your own, some designs are fairly simple.

---

* Pitfall trap (Made of: plastic container, marine antifreeze, liquid dish soap)

The set up:

* Get a reasonably sized plastic container (I personally prefer something round and roughly 1:1 ratio of its diameter to its depth; say 5x5 inches minimum, it doesn't need to be massive either, but it's all up to you.
* Dig a hole in the ground so that the container will fit into it, and allow the top edge of the container to be flush with, or slightly below, the surface of the ground.
* Pour some marine antifreeze into the container so that it's not so full that an insect could conceivably touch the liquid before it could properly fall into the container, approximately half full is probably enough. 
* Now add a squirt of liquid dish soap to the antifreeze and you're all set. 

Notes:

* This is most useful for collecting insects that get around by walking about on the ground.
* I say marine antifreeze here because it's what I found first when searching for something with propylene glycol in it which is not super awful for the environment beyond killing some insects.
* The soap helps break the surface tension so when an insect does fall in, it can sink into the liquid instead of floating on the surface.
* I used this trap type to catch carrion beetles, among other insects, by suspending some spoiling beef liver wrapped in moist gauze over the center of the container. I let this sit for a week with great results.
* Let this sit out for as long as you wish. A week is probably enough time to catch at least something. Bait or not.

---

* Light

The set up:

* Surely you've seen insects swarming around a light source at night. Some of these can easily be captured by plucking them off of the light or nearby structure (light pole, exterior wall of a building), others could be captured by swinging a net through the air under the light as they flutter about. 

---

* Sweep net (Made of a wooden handle, durable fabric, metal ring)

The set up:

* I purchased mine, others have made their own, but it's a wooden handle/pole, canvas for the net material (or some durable fabric) and a metal ring to mount the net onto the handle.

Notes:

* Sweep nets are used to sweep through vegetation, typically, to capture insects that are hanging out (hiding, eating, whatever) on the stems/leaves of plants. Thus, the use of canvas or other durable textile is preferable to the material used in butterfly nets, since that would easily rip when swung through a weedy field or woody brush.
* If you get one of these, consider replying here and I can explain the technique for using it to retain any insects you might catch and how to remove them from the net without them flying away. Although I'm sure there are videos on YouTube and elsewhere that can demonstrate this too.

---

* Beating sheet (Not sure if there's a better name for this... Made of light color fabric, two pieces of wood/plastic/metal, a length of wood/metal/plastic for beating things)

The set up:

* Any light colored fabric will work here, say an old white t-shirt, a pillow case, disposable bed sheet, etc. Dimensions could start at 2 feet by 2 feet, though maximum size can be as large as you wish.
* For ease of use, find two lengths of wood/plastic/metal that will fit the diagonal of your fabric so that the material can be folded at the corners around the tips of your wood/plastic/metal - like [this](https://www.bioquip.com/html/view_prodpics.asp?CatalogNum=2840R&P=3).
* Find a large stick of metal/wood/plastic that is hefty enough to strike a bush or tree branch and cause it to shake. Approximately 2 feet long is a good start, 3 feet is probably better.

Notes:

* Once you have this assembled find a tree or perhaps a large woody shrub. While holding the fabric sheet, place it under a branch with one hand. With the other hand holding your beating stick, relieve some stress and whack the branch/limb of the plant several times. You should start to see things falling onto the sheet, some of these things will be insects, many will probably be small, though some may be larger. Some insects will remain stationary for several moments after falling, others will try to flee immediately.
* Once you're satisfied with what's fallen you should collect any insects you want into some container that you hopefully have nearby. 
* For particularly small insects, you may consider purchasing an [aspirator](https://www.bioquip.com/search/DispProduct.asp?pid=1135A) (I've heard this called a ""pooter"" before), though you probably won't need to since they will likely be hard to identify visually due to their size. This makes it easier to physically collect them off the sheet and retain them without having to grab forceps and hope you don't crush them.
* One could conceivably use one, or several, white bed sheet(s) by simply laying it on the ground under a tree and allowing the insects to fall to the ground upon the sheet. This might be a more economic way to involve students in the collection effort without needing to have several individual sheets for them to hold.

---

There are definitely other ideas/designs for traps and collecting but I'm drawing a blank at the moment. Again, hopefully others can offer something different as well.

Regarding your use of the tullgren funnel just be sure that you don't place too much material into it. If the lamp isn't strong enough then the insects may find refuge in lower portions of the material without falling into the collection container. Otherwise, finding moist/damp material should be better than dry material. 

To me, the most hands on and entertaining way to catch insects is with a net, if not bare hands. The net is pretty fast, will often yield a large amount of insects (assuming they're present of course) and needs a minimum of technique to use properly. The other methods, like using lights or pitfall traps, of course require patience and are probably poor in terms of heightening interest for, what I assume are young, students. Going hands on can be great since it's the most direct interface for anyone to become familiar with insects, though there's certainly an element of fear/apprehension/disgust for those that do not tolerate insect presence.

Finally, buildings are a place where insects may be found too, both inside and out. Wasps like to make nests under eaves, and ants, flies, and roaches are not at all uncommon indoors. This doesn't include occasional visitors like moths or beetles, among others, that wander in on occasion.

I hope some of this is useful for you. If you have any questions or need clarification I'll be glad to offer what I can. Good luck with everything!",2018-06-03 07:46:24
749,"The way you describe it, it sounds like your heart flutters when you think about him. You describe him as cute and say you're attracted to him. That's a crush. I don't think you can call yourself a lesbian because there is a group of women who do have never felt those feelings for a male and we call those women lesbians.

You don't experience sexual attraction to him but I would argue that since some crushes (for example in children) are nonsexual, and since we still acknowledge them as attraction and would say 'that kid is attracted to girls' if a kid had crushes on girls, we should apply the same logic to you.

750,"""This post simply doesn't belong here"" 

As with whatever flap in any henhouse: 

'Fox doesn't belong here' - right.

And if ""Let's All Pretend"" pantomime had a name, this one's game might be: 'Yeah, Right' (and 'here's your character's motivation'):

""Like That's Fox's Big Worry, Whether Or Not He 'Belongs' In The Henhouse (No, Really) - Or Whether His Being There Is (wait for it ...) 'Appropriate.' Especially Once He's Thru The Door And In Like Flint. That's When It Really Matters To Fox. What An Arrow Of Discernment, Piercing The Very Heart Of - A Predator's Main Concern.""

Beyond hand wringing about what 'belongs' and woe - ""Oh, that such a thing should happen"" - there's also a certain bewilderment to enact, sort of: 'How Did Such A Dire Thing Happen?  

Most often, the perplexed subtext is scripted - and I quote: 

""Who let Fox in the henhouse?""  

Nothing against 'wide eyed' innocent/indignant routine. Wringing hands over Fox having gotten in is fine and dandy.  Nor to question rulings handed down about what 'belongs' where. ""Even in a court of such competent jurisdiction, Grandma?"" (asked Riding Hood)

But last I checked, ethnobotany is a disciplinary field like any other. As such it bears responsibilities. Unless that's blasphemy.

Which wouldn't make it untrue if so, merely - forbidden speech; ""ready for its downvote Mr DeMille.""



If only a field were some pure realm of sciencey bits and fascinating info - like what the Bongo Bongo do with some intriguing plant. There would never be ethical issues or dilemmas. Nor would any such have ever emerged in ethnobotany when the fundamental integrity with its scientific and professional foundations under 'subliminal siege' post 1960s - courtesy of a historically adventitious subculture. 

The psychedelic movement sees what it likes in ethnobotany and likes what it sees.  Same as in some other key fields of certain 'proprietary' interest up for 'adoption' - i.e. easy grabs to move in and territorialize.

There's rhyme and reason to ethnobotany having become surrounded by tripperly interests eagerly beavering, entrenching 360 degrees like diem bien phu - and moving in on the field. Slowly but surely gaining entry into its fold here and there at little easy access 'all aboard' points - isn't some random anomaly or freak happenstance. Merely the sort of thing that goes on, in whatever disciplinary field that 'glitters' to certain ambitions with designs upon it - when nobody professionally in charge is paying conscientious attention to matters underway right under 'expert' noses.   

Or worse - when professionals in key positions are actually conniving along with such ambitions. Helping Fox with his henhouse application to - get in.  

Carrying on for all it's worth about how Fox doesn't 'belong here' in ethnobotany's chicken coop - is all 'well and good.'  But what about it?  How now, brown cow? 

'Who let Fox in the Henhouse'?  Where and how did pseudoscience of by and for psychedelia become the 'customary and usual' - standard fare anymore - in 'ethnobotany'? 

What the hell happened and how, with what complicity - by whoever shoulda known better?  

The reinvention of ethnobotany as a tripper's 'field of expertise' was notably furthered in 1992 by that albatross around any neck Terence McKenna - his book FOOD OF THE GODS. Claiming to be ethnobotany and sold on false pretense as such - the publication stunt posed an instructive lesson to the attentive in how to rip off a subject field and wrap oneself in it for a cheering crowd. The better to make friends and influence people, while cashing in.

FOOD OF THE GODS and its 'ethnobotanical' ploy were mere matter of 'fame and fortune' - and to this day the money just keeps on rolling in, as it continues molding and shaping 'ethnobotany's public profile and reputation.  Notwithstanding McKenna's 'research' was fraud, his book ""conceived as a trojan horse"" - 'consciously propaganda' as he gleefully bragged but only ""in private, among friends and fringies"" (as he put it).

That the fake brush strokes in that 'Rembrandt' weren't noticed by its 'target audience' as McKenna called his intended marks - raises no eyebrows.  The same can't be said for gushing praise heaped upon FOOD in a 1993 Scientific American review by - Richard Evans Schultes. No name is better known in ethnobotany 'for real' - or more revered. 

If anyone might have been aware of issues emerging for ethnobotany, and on alert not off - logically it would have, could have - arguably should have been Schultes. Yet in the fraudulent appropriation of ethnobotany by ulterior psychedelic profiteering ambitions of exploitation - his name figures centrally in a disastrous fiasco leaving a stain on Schultes' legacy and reputation - that can never wash out. 
In a dismal failure of indiscriminate complicity cluelessly irresponsible, he audaciously held FOOD OF THE GODS up to specious honors, gave it his 'expert's blessing' - hailing it as a ...:

""... masterpiece of research and writing [that] should be read by every specialist working in the multifarious fields involved with the use of psychoactive drugs - even though many readers may not accept its message.""  

Schultes' radiant word for a McKenna's 'research' circus show may be too 'emperor's newly clothed' for anyone to be able to even mention in the ethnobotanical kingdom - but it was soon to be enshrined and ballyhooed in subculture as 'expert's official endorsement' - scriptural:
https://erowid.org/culture/characters/mckenna_terence/mckenna_terence_review2.shtml

As a blueprint for the brave new subculturally-configured interest in schmethnobotany - FOOD sells like hot cakes to this day, continually 'inspiring' the next generation of 'ethnobotanists.'

As precedent - first shoe to drop was in 1960s/1970s at UCLA (dept of anthropology): 'ethnobotany' of the 'Yaqui' (no less) served as handy ploy for one of subculture's 'distinguished' frauds - Carlos Castaneda with his 'native informant' don Juan, notoriously faked. 

Academic-scholarly fraud top to bottom. When the fact was recognized, it was - too late. Anthropology had been bought and - sold into making millions of dollars with paperback sales to peasant trippers - voila, ethnobotany now 'sexy' to fans across the fruited plain.

Anthropology isn't some millionaire able to keep possession of its own goods against leveraged buyout from Castaneda - appropriating its mantle, investing in 'ethnobotany' for trippers. 

To this day the field has never been the same - and the cash from that con keeps rolling in, la la la.  It's call money, honey.  The field got a whole new lease onlife by such charlatanism. Anthropology may not be respected anymore by other disciplines, after that fiasco. But so what? It now has subcultural honor as an 'ally' field perfect for whoever's psychedelic ministry dressed in 'don Juan' genuflections.  

Compared to its peak of public prestige back in its Madge Mead heyday, anthro prolly gets just as many students as ever. But alas all from the ""Evergreen State Kollege"" trough, Birkenstock-wearing trippers and SJWs.  Not exactly 'grade A' material, as in the glory daze when Mead was the field's mascot. Those days are gone. 

But with pod people manning its mizzenmast - full speed ahead. Whether they 'belong in the hen house' or not according to some flit flap or flutter.

751,"It seems pretty tame by today's standards that's true. But that's only because every other movie that you see nowadays stems from the influence of Citizen Kane. Citizen Kane is Monumental in its technical achievements. I think Jimmy Stewart said it best when he said that every single movie before Citizen Kane was just a play that they happened to film.

It was the first time that movie used visual cues in the art direction in order to tell the story as opposed to having it be led by an actor's performance. For instance, instead of two characters talking about how someone should not be trusted, show the person not to be trusted seated by a fire with only half their face lit. It achieves the same goal, but with a much more profound effect on the audience without falling into the whole *Cabinet of Dr. Caligari* surrealism.

It invented new shots such as the worm's eye view, the documentary shot, and the American shot. We use these all the time now but at the time these types of things were unheard of. Why would you put a camera in a tree in order to film an actor through fluttering leaves over the lens? Because artistically it gives a strong sense of realism.

As far as storytelling, it did something pretty big there too. It showed that you can do a satire and a parody and have it *not* be a comedy or a biography. That had never been done because before then all satires were all comedies like *The Great Dictator* or they were dramatic biographies like *All the King's Men.* It showed you could parody someone and criticize them and make fun of them, but do so in a serious drama. 

It even went as far as to change the concept of film acting. It changed that you don't need the big movements and the loud words, like stage actors do, in order to get the point across. You don't need Soliloquy and pages of exposition anymore when you can just present what needs to be known on film through Visual stimuli. Small movements like the movement of an eyebrow can set the emotional tone for the entire scene. 

I think modern audiences are so used to seeing film that was influenced by Citizen Kane that they forget how Monumental Citizen Kane actually was for the time. It was a very important film because it showed how far film could go to present a compelling story.",2018-06-03 08:20:23

Thanksgiving Day, 2003.

Fort Jackson, SC*

Being a big holiday, the Drill Sergeants had taken the day off from working us and had us performing 'barracks maintenance' (cleaning) instead.  Being a mixed company, the males were cleaning their side of the building while the females worked on their own separate side.  At some point, a woman dressed to the nines came strutting across the drill pad out front of our building and being as we hadn't seen a non-army female in quite some time the guys all gathered up at the windows to stare.  

Curious, I joined them, saw the Lady in the Red Dress, and then noticed the two drills standing outside as well, watching us.

I started trying to at least get my platoon to get away from the windows and get back to work before we got nailed for creeping, but no dice.  So I just cleaned on my lonesome, missing out on the view.

About ten minutes later, after she had left again, we males found ourselves summoned to the drill pad, the two NCOs glaring death at us.

>**DS1** ""Okay, who cat-called the commander's wife?""

Silence.  Confused stares.  No one knew.

Because no one stepped forward, we were then led through a rigorous smoke session (lots of rapid exercise, most often pushups and flutter kicks).  After the first ten minutes and requests for confession, one guy stood up and said it was him.  The Drills said they knew who had done it, it wasn't the guy who confessed, and now he would stand in front of the company males and watch as we beat our faces.

After almost another half hour, several more had attempted to take the hit and call the Drill Sergeant bluff, but they were just left standing watching us.

Finally they dismissed us to get cleaned up for thanksgiving lunch with a promise to finish this after lunch...and they detailed one of the confessors to start hosing down the area out front of the company to make a mud pit.  They said they 'would like to see what we enjoyed for lunch.'

In spite of the no talking, no dessert rules being suspended for the holiday, the males all moved and ate as if they were dead men walking and the method of execution would be via vomiting everything we had ever eaten.  We didnt talk, just nibbled in sullen silence.  

Once we were dismissed from chow, we were marched back to the company and the females were dismissed from the formation to continue whatever.  We males stood, silent, awaiting the doom, the mud pit behind us prepared.

>**DS1** ""Okay, guys, take a seat.  No one cat called the commanders wife.  This was a lesson in professionalism and perception.  We know who you are, but you didnt know her--you gave the appearance of being a bunch of unprofessional pigs.

Aleine looked up from her book to see what had her *vhenan* so out of sorts.

The look on Solas' face as he entered the rotunda was thunderous, and he gripped a stack of parchment in hand so tightly it was a wonder it hadn't torn.

""What's the matter?"" she asked, setting her book aside and rising, taken aback for a moment at his ire.

""Dorian has just shared with me something... so *inappropriate*..."" He almost seemed lost for words, choosing instead to thrust the parchment at her. Frownin, Aleine took the manuscript and began to read.

""**'The ice of winter melts before the passion of new spring blossoms with a scandalous tale of wise confidant and fresh, young leader. The Randy Dowager presents, with wistful sighs, The Fire Waltz'**--"" Aleine stopped cold and stared up at him. ""This is about us.""

""Yes, it is about us!"" Solas all but hissed, storming over to his desk and leaning heavily over it. ""I do not know who wrote it or where this copy came from, but somehow your *friend* was in possession of it. And took great pains to bring it to my attention.""

""Of course he did."" The woman grinned, feeling the human mage's eyes on them from above but not lifting her eyes back up from the page. Dorian and Solas never really got along, but he was her best friend, so she knew the teasing was meant in good fun.

""**'The Fire Waltz, being a tale of elves brought together by magic and war. Will duty come before desire, or will their hearts sing a different tune?'**""

Solas grabbed the document back. ""It is *drivel!* **'New love sparks a flame within old blood'**?? Oh for--""

Aleine laughed brightly, plucking the pages from Solas' hand as he sputtered indignantly. ""**'Ancient history inspires adventures to new realms.

It can take some work/searching and a little patience but its been so worth it for me. 

I constantly check the new arrivals, so specific searches for brands/items and Ill include things that are already in someones cart so that when their timer runs out I can pick it up. Ive found such great things, but Ive done it over the past few months since things are always coming and going. There are generally always extra % off coupons or free shipping and their returns are amazing. In my experience, Ive printed off my return slip dropped it off at the post office and they put my credit in my account the same day ~ two hours later even when they havent gotten my items back to their warehouse yet. Then, I can just use that credit on something else. 

Just a few examples!

[I picked up this for $16](https://www.express.com/clothing/women/striped-linen-blend-flutter-sleeve-dress/pro/07851036/color/BLUE%20STRIPE). Its brand new with the tags still on and still on the Express website.

817,"""Elizabeth?""

The queen didn't respond. She lay quietly on the left of the bed. She always slept on the left, even after her husband died. Meredith smiled down at the woman's wizened features, stern but soft. She told her once that did it as a memorial.

Meredith leaned in closer and raised her voice, just a tad.

""Elizabeth?""

Her eyes fluttered open.

""Mer?..""

Meredith nodded quickly.

""Yes, it's me.""

The queen nodded, struggling to draw in a breath.

""They're still...waiting?""

Meredith took her hand.

""Yes, your majesty.""

The issue couldn't wait. There was almost no time left. Elizabeth was the sixth in her line to carry the name. She was an only child, her husband was dead, and they had never given birth to children.

When she was gone, there would be no one else.

The United British Empire had lived under her rule for almost seventy years, carrying on resolutely through one of the most brutal periods of European history to date, and perhaps the most cruel in the history of the world. It began with conflicts over oil, then food, and then finally water. Economies collapsed, nations fell, and the old democracies crumbled into ruin. Chaos reigned.

Not in England.

It was something of a national joke that the British were too sensible to tolerate that kind of nonsense. In truth, the explanation was far more precise. The Queen bound them together.

Through countless trials and conflicts, through austerity and peril, though hunger, thirst, and desolation, her image and her example had carried them through. Speeches, appearances, humanitarian labor and work; days without sleep, nights without end, and bitter struggles that dragged on for years...decades. Whenever anyone asked where she found the strength, she always gave the same answer, a response that had grown to become the motto of the new empire: The strength of our heritage sustains me.

It was no wonder she never found time for children.

Meredith helped her to sit up against the headboard.

""Your majesty, you have to name someone. The whole country is waiting.""

The queen shook her head and took another breath.

""No...""

She descended into a fit of coughing. She wasn't ill. She was just...old. Her time had come.

She pointed to her nightstand.

""There's a case.""

Meredith opened the drawers and searched. There were books, trinkets, old photographs, and stacks of paper: briefings, notes, and endless memoranda.

There was only one case.

It was made from oak, and very old. The wood was bone dry with age and wear. She had served the queen her entire life, and she had never seen it before.

The queen opened her hand.

""Here...""

Meredith handed it over.

""What is it?""

The queen smiled and undid the box's tiny gold latch.

""The past...and the future.""

She drew out a key. It was made from iron. The metal had been meticulously kept, oiled and polished. Meredith didn't recall ever having cleaned it. The queen must have performed the task herself.

For how long?

Meredith looked up.

""What must I do?""

The queen smiled.

""Go to the basement...beneath the tower. There is a door.""

Her eyes fluttered shut. For a moment her chest ceased to move.

Meredith threw herself forward. She shook the queen, gently at first and then more forcefully. Her head began to droop.

""Your majesty! Your majesty, wake up!""

For just a moment, the queen's eyes lifted. Her glimpse was glassy and her glance was fixed.

Meredith spoke.

""Your majesty, there is no time left. Who? Who will come after you?""

The corners of the queen's mouth twitched, imperceptibly.

Her words were barely audible.

""Whosoever pulleth out the sword...rightwise sovereign...born of England.""

Then she was gone.

Meredith began to cry. She took the key in her hands. There was an inscription on its face, a pair of initials: AP

The door opened. A messenger came in.

""What did she say?""

Meredith regarded the queen for a moment. Her face was still. She turned to the messenger.

""Summon the cabinet and the party leaders. We must go to the Tower of London.""

The messenger raised an eyebrow.

""Why? What's there?""

Meredith looked down at the key.

826,"Which is more hellish? The gloomy dark of the subterranean Tartaroo, or the twisted laughters of scorn behind your back? The aberrant texture of the cavern rocks or the snickering and the bickering forth of ""friends""? The boiling lake and cauldron of fire, or the hateful stares and ridicule of supposed peers? The weeping and the gnashing of teeth of tortured souls, or the jesting and the grinning of teeth of trusted succubi? 


As I spend my days in literal Hell, I could not help to see but the agony of the punished humans below here is naught compared to my daily experience of being mocked and seen as inferior by fellow demons. The painful attacks directed toward my heart had led to a woman so much tattered and miserable. Why should a strong demon experience so much sorrow? Do I really belong here?


Such Hell within Hell had begun ever since I was conceived by a human female. I should have been the most beautiful, elegant and gracious of all beings in Hades have it not been for the lack of a pair of a body part - My voluptuous body, pale white skin, two horns, red lustrous hair and long wagging tail all marred in allure for not having a wing.


For even Satan Lucifer Himself would have been happy to cast away such wretched creature until one day - While I was resting, I begin to experience a slight throbbing in my back. Brushing this off as a normal backache, it soon intensified into a severe pain a couple of hours had passed. Until I can experience something solid releasing forth near my spines as if a bone was coming through. This episode resulted in a lot of pain, but when I stood up and looked at the mirror I can see wings already fluttering slightly.


And I was finally vindicated as I predicted and hoped it will be. My misery and torment should be no more. All of my peers shall bow to me and suffer for not recognizing my innate beauty, power and sheer demonic excellence and diabolic superiority. The wings that had sprouted at my back shall be my instrument in taking over all of Gehenna and destroying the salvation of Humanity.


Until I hear a knock at my door. Who the heck is the one who disrupted me? She or he shall learn a lesson and that individual will be my first slave! I shall show the.......


""Hey, Persephone, it's Lilith here ~ Look, I brought you an Infernal Crust Pizza from Demono's Pizza. Look, it's even in the shape of a human's brain ~ ""


""Lilith, why do you have to disrupt me in my greatest moment of epiphany, enlightenment, meditation, realization and climax?""


""Babe, you should stop playing so much weird video games like Daycares and Not-Demons, Satanrim, and books, come go shopping with us and paint our nails and tails and horns on later time!~""


""I have no time for being involved in such frivolities, you....""


""So buying a detachable wing from Walt-Mammon-Mart is not a frivolity? Hmm.......""


""You gotta believe me! It's real, definitely not detachable wing. It just grew on itself......""


""It is made of chicken and duck feather though so it must be very cheap.""


""Hey, Persephone, stop this, you gotta be serious. April 1 is already long over both at Heaven and Earth, Yahweh stopped that prank of pretending to be Nelson Mandela and narrating movies some 3 months ago.""


""Come on, let's remove your definitely-real wings.""


Lilith then started through brute force to remove Persephone's supposedly detachable wings:


""In 3, 2, 1 ~~[MOAN FROM USING FORCE ON PULLING WINGS]~~ Hey, the wing did not detached.""


""Lilith, because it means that is real.""


""No, Persephone, it means you might have a disease because of anorexia bulemia insomnia arthritis or diarrhea meningitis appendectomy osteoporosis or something. You need to go to WraithMD.""


""But Lilith, hu hu hu hu [cries in tears in agony and sorrow]. Why don't you just believe for once, this time only? You and Vignette and Abissia would always tease me for not having real demon wings meaning I am not a real demon and a succubus. Now that I successfully grew wings you won't believe me.""


""Persephone, you've got to listen to me, these are the same chicken wings you see at KFC and at ducks, not real demon wing ones. Real demon wings are beautiful and strong like really demon-like. Avian diseased wings just make you ""clock clock clock"" and fly like a stupid chicken.""

""C'mon now girl.""


While pulling the crying Persephone out of the door, they began to venture to the streets of Hades which are slightly better than the avenues and corners of Detroit.

They overhear a punisher demon talking to a bunch of poor human souls about the list of torture to be given in Hell:
""For every person you murdered, you get 20 hours of swimming in the cauldron lake of 200 celsius.""
Bunch of humans still comfortable and smiling.
""For every woman or man you rape, you get 100 piercings of spear in the intestine.""                            
Bunch of humans still comfortable and smiling.
""For every $10,000 of money you stole, your hand will be cut and then regrow and cut again.""
Someone raised his hand: ""Does piracy and illegal downloading count?""
The demon said: ""No.""
Bunch of humans still comfortable and smiling.
""For every car you have stolen, every bag of drugs you sniffed, for every day you have committed a terrorist attack, you will be thrown into a 100 m cliff.""
Bunch of humans still comfortable and smiling.
""For every one illegal firearm you have owned, 100 bullets will be fired on you.""
Bunch of humans now uncomfortable and smiling nervously
""For every time you have cheated on your wife or husband, you will experience 100 floggings.""
Bunch of humans said to each other: ""Dude, let's run out of here.""
""For every 10 hours you have watched American and Japanese pornography and masturbated, your dick will be cut and regrow and cut again.""
All of the men freaked out and proceeded to run away.


Persephone to Lilith said ""What are all of those men up to?""


Persephone then began to make repeated clocking sounds as a chicken at regular intervals: ""Clock, clock, clock, clock, clock"". Her wings fluttering in an absurd fashion as if a mascot advertising Kentucky Fried Chicken.


""See, Persephone, I was right, you have Hen Incarnation Virus-Avian Invocation Demonic Syndrome, you need to go to WraithMD immediately.""

838,"Haggard  was a fat giant of a man. He towered over his students at nine 9feet tall. Hermione watched in awe as he guided his students  into the magical creature pen just outside his wooden hut. 
""Right, ladies! T'day we're gunna lern aboot Brarhead Hoonds! Tern to page 69 of yer textbooks!"" 
There was a flutter of paper  as students opened their books.  A Japanese girl to Hermione's right raised her hand. 
""P-Professor? Do you mean, Braehead Hounds?"" 
""Aye, chinky,"" Haggard replied, ""Thas what I said - Brarhead Hoonds.""
There was a pause  as Haggard opened the gate. Two excited Braehead Hounds leapt and barked.
""Ahh need two 2volunteers!"" Haggard boomed. 
He scratched his beard and looked at the class before suddenly pointing at Hermione. 
""Whoremione! You'll do! And I need one more... Oy! Slanty eyes! You're up as well! Get in the pen!"" 
Hermione and the Japanese  girl stood up and stepped into the Braehead Hounds'  pen.
""Now, girls. These are magical creechurs. Yeh have to be be very careful because these are horny dogs! I'm gunna teach yeh how to handle them safely!""
Haggard then closed the gate and locked it shut. 
Ring ring   
""Aww shit, that's mah phone.  I'll be back faster than Congress  can impeach Trump.""   
Haggard wandered off, leaving the girls locked inside the wooden fence with the Hounds while the class watched.  Suddenly the Braehead Hounds  began to walk towards the girls!
""G-good d-doggy..."" the Japanese  girl whimpered, stepping back and raising open palms.  
Suddenly, one of the Hounds  leapt at her, knocking her onto her back. She landed on the ground, her schoolgirl skirt lifting up to reveal her panties. Hermione watched as the Japanese  girl's arms sank into the muddy earth.  She struggled to stand back up - but her arms were completely stuck! 
The Braehead Hound  wasted no time ploughing its snout  between her yellow thighs. It's sharp teeth quickly found her cotton panties and chewed them off, exposing her virgin pussy to the entire class!
""N-Noooo!"" she screamed.
Hermione panicked as the second Hound turned to face her. In a frantic flurry she made a dash  for the wooden fence. There was a small crack between the planks - maybe enough for Hermione to squeeze through. She could hear the Hound chasing her!
""Ah! Dammit!"" Hermione cried.
She had tried to dive through the gap, but she had only managed to get her upper half through the hole. She was stuck waist down in the pen. No matter how she struggled and wriggled, the little witch couldn't break free.
She frantically searched for her wand,  grabbing it from her cloak's pocket. As she lifted the magical stick to cast a spell it was snatched from her hand! 
""Sorry, does this belong to you, Whoremione?"" Muffloy jeered.
The Slither-in student had stolen her only defence against the Hound.
""Give that back!"" Hermione yelled.
""No, I think the class would rather watch what happens next, you filthy mudblood."" 
The Japanese  girl's arms were still stuck in the thick muddy soil. The Braehead Hound  had buried its head between her thighs now. Its long, wet  tongue  was repeatedly caressing her virgin slit, lapping up her teenage juices. 
""Ah! Ah! Ahhh! St-stooohhhhp! Ayaaaaahhhhhh!""
The Hound slurped and slobbered    at her cunt, its hot tongue  driving her  with unwanted pleasure. Her little clitoris  was burning with each graze of the beast's  talented muscle. 
""Oh!!! Ohhhhh! I'm cuuummmmmiing!"" she screamed, her body convulsing. 
She shook and thrashed near-uncontrollably. The unwanted orgasm rocked her body to its core. But the Hound  wasn't finished yet - it continued licking  even after she had finished.
""W-Wait! Ahhh! T-too sensitive!!!! Ooooohhhh! Ahhhhhhhh!!!""
Hermione was not having much luck  either. The second Hound had placed its paws upon her back in an attempt to mount her. It's hard, eight 8inch shaft was already pressing up against her tight vulva  through her panties. It thrust forward as hard as it could, but the elastic panties refused to yield. 
""Oh! Ah! Bad dog! Ah!"" Hermione gasped.
She struggled to break free and keep her composure in front of her class. If she could only last until Haggard came back...
rrrrriiiipppp
""AHHHHHHH!""
Hermione's panties suddenly snapped and eight inches of doggy dick plunged into her soaking wet pussy.  
She felt it fill up her body, stretching her cunt with its thick cock. Almost immediately it began to thrust in and out at an inhumanly quick pace. 
""Ah! Ah! Ah!"" 
Her moans came fast. Too fast. She could barely catch her breath.  She curled her toes  as the pleasure spread like a plague  throughout her body. With each thrust her big breasts   swung back and forth.
She clenched her hands  and banged her fists  against the fence. Her efforts were fruitless though - she was well and truly stuck.
The Japanese  student had cum four 4times now. Her little mind was going blank as the hound's  unceasing tongue  never stopped licking.
""Aaaahhh! Oh yes!! Yesss!!! I'm a little doggy slut!!! Lick  my pussy  !"" she hollered, another orgasm washing through her body.
Hermione felt something thick begin to swell within her pussy. 
""Oh look,"" Muffloy laughed, ""it's knotting Whoremione!""
The swelling pushed up and stretched her pussy, placing an immense pressure upon her quivering g-spot. This was enough to drive  her over the edge.
""Oh! Oh fuck! I'm cummming! Nooooooohhhhhhh!!!""
Hermione's body betrayed her as she came. Seconds later she heard the Hound howl.
""Arroooooo!""
""No! Don't cum inside me!""
Hermione knew that many of the magical creatures in Haggard's class could impregnate girls. Right now was a very dangerous time of the month for her!
She felt a hot, goopy fluid rush into the depths of her pussy  and flood into her fertile womb. The sensation was enough to send a second orgasm through her teenage body. Already, the Hound's sperm were swimming towards her teenage eggs , seeking to fertilise them. As the Braehead Hound  continued to cum, the cum began to leak  out of her pussy  and trickle down her thighs.
""Hahaha!"" the class roared in laughter at the two girls' plight. 
""Looks like Whoremione is going to be a pregnant slut now!"" Muffloy jeered, egging the crowd on.
""N-noooooo! Get me out of the fence! I- ahhh- I need to get the cum out! Ooooh!""
After five minutes of pumping her pussy  full of cum,  the Hound finally released her, leaving her lower half drenched in thick white semen.  The Japanese  girl wasn't faring any better. The Hound  had finally left her alone - but she was still quivering on the ground in the aftershock of twelve 12consecutive orgasms.
Haggard returned four hours later - long enough for the Hounds to fuck the Japanese  girl, and for Hermione's tight little ass  to get flooded with doggy cum too.

""Oh bugger,"" mumbled Haggard, ""I've already hit mah allowed limit of eight impregnated students this month. The school nurse is gunna kill  me...""",2018-06-03 21:05:08

851,"The next wizard to step forward was a hunched and trembling old elf. Elves live for untold thousands of years, so to see one in such an advanced state of age is truly a marvel. His old voice wavered when he spoke, but its assuredness could not be ignored. The use of staffs and items has been around for millenia, and while the gnomes words are true, he fails to mention the important detail that spells channeled through an item are extremely limited in scope. Wizards relying on them never amount to anything beyond simple enchanters.

The gnome scowled but remained silent.

We would neuter the entire magical community for the rest of our existence if we limit our studies to the simple teachings of item enchantment. The only way for one to retain the power and flexibility of true magic is through the spoken word. We must proceed with the teachings of ancient incantations. There is no other way to properly express oneself while at the same time respecting the great history of magic. The old elf shuffled back and nodded for the next wizard to proceed.

Next in line was a small pixie from the forest. She stood only about 4 feet high, and was extremely thin and wispy in appearance. With a quick vibration of her wings she scooted forward to the front of the stage before landing lightly and addressing the crowd. Humble citizens, while I respect the spoken arts of magic, it cannot be denied that it is far and away the most risky of all proposed schools. The winds will never cease to blow and swirl and despite taking all precautions, they shall scoop away untold amounts of energies from your lips which will spark and tumble in magical storms the world over.

The crowd murmured in agreement. The High Kings simply stared on.

In fact, I wouldnt be surprised if the vast majority of entanglements cases are a direct result of speaking incantations into the ether. It simply isnt safe. Therefore I propose the use of written runes and hieroglyphs. She held forth a large leather bound tome, and flipped open its pages. She pointed to the ancient etchings and scrawlings within.
The crowd leaned forward in their seats to try to get a better look at the strange tome. It was a wonder her skinny arms could even support such a weight.

By invoking written powers, we can control the flows of magic in a safe way, while also allowing for the same breadth and flexibility of the spoken word. I believe nothing more needs to be said, and she very confidently snapped shut the tome and made her way back to the line on stage.

All eyes fell to me. I could feel a bead of sweat break out on my forehead. She made a compelling argument, but I didnt get to where I was now by being a coward. I stepped forward. I was nothing special. A mere human. I stood to my full height and called out to the crowd and the High Kings alike. Invoking written runes and texts can indeed be quite powerful, and one could argue even safe, but there is no room for flexibility in the moment.

The crowd murmured amongst themselves and I knew I had to explain. 

The ancient texts and scrawling spells she refers to take hours to prepare and are often destroyed upon use. If going on a journey youd have to prepare a massive and often impractical spellbook before you could ever hope to venture forth. If any situation were to arise which you hadnt accounted for, youd be hopeless to respond and instead would be at the mercy of the world or your assailant.

I could see the crowd considering my words.

The High Kings blinked in unison as they watched my small form upon the stage.

Time to propose my technique. Instead, I offer a new way of performing magic. One which doesnt require interacting with the arcane mists around us at all. One which draws power from within. My tapping into ones own soul, you may use its power to do all sorts of wonderful things. No words need spoken. No runes need written. It is quite safe, extremely flexible, and might I even suggest the most powerful form of magic the world has ever witnessed.

This caused quite a stir from the crowd.

The gnome stepped forward. Such a thing has never been proven before. You stand here and claim to tap into the power of your own soul? I say impossible! Attempted yes, but successful? Never. In fact, I believe a few foolish wizards have died attempting such a thing.

The crowd burst into a flurry of noise and booing and cheering. It was all jumbled chaos as they discussed all that was said. The four techniques all seemed to have their merits.

The High Kings raised their hands and after a moment silence fell over the stadium. It is time now to vote, they said. The crowd all said various words into the air, and the High Kings eyelids fluttered with energy as they did so. Finally they opened their eyes. It is a perfect four way tie, they said. 

The crowd gasped.

The winner shall be chosen instead by a simple test. They snapped their fingers and four simple wooden chairs appeared on the stage, one before each of us. You shall all attempt to change your chair into a table, while at the same time turning your opponents chairs into a newt.

The gnome looked at his staff and tried to smile, but doubt could be seen clear on his face. 

The pixie desperately flipped through her tome, her finger scanning the pages one after another, but it was clear she wasnt finding what she looked for.

The wrinkled old elf stepped forward and flexed his shoulders. He looked ready.

I felt ready too. I reached deep within myself and connected to the source of power I knew would be there. I drew from that power and without uttering a word I attempted to turn my chair into a table. It should have been easy but I could hear the old elf chanting and his commands were preventing my desired effect. I glanced over at his chair and realized it was nearly a table. I redirected some energy towards his chair and it slowly started to grow a little tail. It was shrinking and looking more newt like with every moment. 

He finally finished his chant and with a great word he commanded my chair into a newt.

It was shrinking before my very eyes. I tried hard as I could to stop it but I didnt have enough power. I tried my best but I could feel myself wavering. I was drawing too much strength from within and I knew I couldnt keep this up for long. His chair had grown again and was nearly the size of a full table.

The gnome and the pixie stood before their chairs as well, each trying anything to make them move or change, but neither were successful so far and no changes could be seen.

In a moment it would all be over. I would have lost and the spoken word would win. Id be reduced to a life without magic. I couldnt let that happen. In my desperation I suddenly felt a great source of power throughout the stadium. Yes...of course. There were souls all around. Thousands of them. More power than I could ever dream. I reached out with my mind and could feel them all. They were beautiful. With a gasp of exertion I changed my chair into a table, while at the same time turning the elfs gnomes and pixies chairs into newts. I did it!

There was a great commotion throughout the stadium. Screams and panic echoed through the air. I lifted my gaze. The High Kings were sprawled on their backs. Their thrones had vanished. In fact the entire stadium seemed to have fallen to their backs. 

Newts! Its newts! The cries echoed on the air. Screams from women, laughter from some.

The High Kings rolled to their feet in one smooth motion. From under their shadows small newts could be seen scurrying away to hide from the sun. Their beautiful thrones were gone. Turned to newts. In fact I had turned every chair in the stadium into a newt.
The High Kings looked at me, and for the first time in the history of recorded magic, they smiled.

852,"As was the royal prerogative of school teachers everywhere in the universe, the students had to be made uncomfortable to truly absorb the wondrous Education the local equivalent of a high school provided. To accomplish the feat, the Mandatory First Class Introduction was spawned onto this sinful world.

Lara dreaded this moment. Not only was she socially awkward, the would have to show the reason for her social awkwardness in front of the entire class, which would inevitably lead to yet more social awkwardness.

Oh sure, by the statistics, she had a gift. A morph not seen before on the entire planet! And with such useful features, too! More stamina than anything we've ever seen! People will be tripping over each other to give you a Job! With great Benefits!

No statement using that many exclamation marks should be trusted. It's not that it's a lie. But the truth should not be playing Twister like that.

Her turn was slowly coming up. ""I'm Ben, and my morph is a horse! I'm Sam, and my morph is a zebra! I'm Philly, and my morph is a dragon...""

Stupid dragon morphs. So lucky to get such a useful, common animal. 

""And what about you, Won't you tell us about youself?""

""My name is Lara.""

Silence. The teacher hit her with a very deliberate stare. It was just innocuous enough to dismiss as mere interest, yet expressive enough to convey the desired message. Truly, this man was a master at his craft.

""My morph... the Council still doesn't have a name for my morph.""

""Do you hear that class? That's really interesting! Won't you show it to us?""

""Please no, sir, I... didn't sleep well.""

""Now come on, Lara, we both know that is just an excuse. Don't be shy.""

Dammit. She really wished she was better at making excuses. Unfortunately, that kind of practice would require friends. Well, here goes.

In an instant, Lara was gone, and replaced by her morph.

""Oh god, that's hideous!"", yelled the girl sitting at a table next to her, just as expected. It was amazing, how people who've never met each other always exclaimed the same four words.

The classroom devolved into a state of chaos. Several of the students vomited, the former contents of their stomachs rocketing onto the ceiling. Lara's neighbor across the row morphed into a cheetah and ran straight for the door. Base survival instincts took over a student next to the windows, who tried to roll out of them and into safety. Unfortunately (or fortunately, for the school's financials), he only managed to bounce off.

The teacher showed some emotion, but still managed to keep a facade of calmness, and quickly reinstated order in his domain. Despite his experience, though, he struggled.

It was not the ghastly off-yellow colour that got people. It was all the wrinkling, and those bone-meat things ending in five...micro-penises each? And legs... that body shouldn't have legs! It looked so close to Lara's true form, but it was so unimaginably wrong it triggered the basic, tribal desire to stab any problems with a pointy sticks until they were no longer problems.^1 

""Well, that was quite something, wasn't it, children? I think we'll have an early break now"", the teacher stammered out after a protracted period of silence. Lara had reverted into her base form for the long-term mental health benefits of everyone involved.

""Try to treat Lara nicely, please? She's a student just like you"", added the teacher, perhaps to reassure himself that Lara belonged to the same species as he did. The plea fell on deaf ears, however. Nobody dared to speak a word, and the only sound one could hear were the black leaves of a shrub just outside the classroom fluttering in the wind.

Well, that, and the grinding of metal against hardwood as students struggled to move their tables as far from Lara as they could. True, they could go out and have their breaks, but there were matters of  personal safety to attend to.

Still, there was a bit of a smile-thing to Lara's face after the whole incidents. There was this one boy who didn't scream... too much. Perhaps she could finally talk to someone?

It's not like she can lose anything that she couldn't regenerate. Plus, those face tentacles looked really sweet.

Maybe there was some hope in this world? Lara stood up, and slithered her way out of the classroom, thinking about the possibilities of future. Maybe they could come up with a name for the morph together, if it all worked out.

855,"Hobies are IMO best at dealing with vegetation as there's no propeller spinning to wrap stuff up. The fins occasionally do catch some grass but it's very quick and easy to clear them off. Most vegetation goes right under with no problem, if it's just insane I fold the fins up flat against the hull and paddle until I'm clear of the grass.

As for shallow I'd still say Hobie is the best but the new Jackson FlexDrive does have a shallow water operation mode as well. I'm not sure exactly how shallow jacksons go but in a Hobie you can still flutterkick and get a bit of propulsion in like 6-8"" of water. When it gets too shallow for that you just bungie your pedals apart which folds the fins up flat and then either paddle or pushpole your way through the shallows.


Another thing to think about is what happens when you run into something (when, not if. It will happen eventually) you didn't see like a submerged log or stump, or when it suddenly gets shallow in a hurry. Hobie fin rods are designed to bend (rather than breaking the drive) and are like $25 to replace IF you can't bend it back straight. Jackson FD folds up into the hull when you hit something. Most other pedal yaks will be taking quite a hard hit to their drive system.

But I've taken and seen to the horses of a hundred lordlings and ladies, it can hardly be called *meeting* someone. Still, he seemed a decent sort. Never sneered at me like some of them do. Of course, I think that's more to do with the stable stench than any sort of ill will.""

Beatle and Prancer, having grown bored with the patch of good grass, began moving again, and Boros began to catch up with Lann, who was now stopped. He was about to say something further, perhaps about the Lannisport Lannisters whom he was more familiar with than those of the Rock, when he caught sight of a fluttering of blue in the corner of his eye. He turned his head even as he continued leading the horses, calling back with a smile.

""Good morning, m'lady!""

Zhoe was standing on the stone landing, just outside the door to her grand solar. Big with child, she made her way down carefully, a hand on her belly. 

""Good morning, Boros. I hope they're not too ornery.""

""Never, m'lady. Well, Honey's being her usual self, but nothing we can't handle. Happy to be out, I'm sure. Just like her mistress."" 

""Quite right."" Zhoe made her way out into the courtyard, approaching Honey and Lann. The mare's attention seemed drawn to her, and she huffed contentedly as Zhoe scratched her snout. 

""And how are you handling her, Lann? I hope she's not bitten you too many times.""",2018-06-04 00:05:06

860,"Ive tried every hobie on the market with the exception being the adventure island.  No doubt they are top notch with their mirage drive, but their top three yaks, the outback, the pa12 and 14 dont paddle well im my opinion.  They do have their purpose, but i like being able to paddle as well as peddle.  So for me i have to have both options.  Ive spent some time in a slayer propel, and i own a radar 135 with the helix peddle drive.  The down side of propeller drives is like the other guy said, they catch vegitation, and dont work at all in real shallow water.  My Radars peddle drive is useless in water from 1 to 1.5 feet. But my goal has always been to get a stable yak that i can easily stand and fish, i wanted a peddle drive to cover distance if i had too, and i didn't want a yak that didnt paddle well.  So for me the radar fits me perfect.  I dont even take the helix drive to the texas marsh as most of the time i cant use it much because its too shallow.  Like others have said, you can flutter kick the mirage drive though, and it is by far the best ive tried in really shallow water.  Im hoping to get another yak for the salt water.  My radar is a great yak for bass fishing, but i think im going to get a viking reload , or a Wildy tarpon 160 for the salt.  Its worth it to rent a few if you can to try them out for the style of fishing you plan on doing.  ",2018-06-04 00:37:51

A bunch of Irish stepdancers (roughly college aged) came into my store, and their feathery flaming orange coif upon their alabaster faces and emerald green eyes pierced my heart. I was married at the time (curly haired brunette), and would never stray for anyone, so I kept it as a crush but never forgot my heart fluttering that day. 

Decades later, my wife passes away, and when I was ready to date again, redheads stood out like a beacon. I wanted to date again, but was met with frustration. I figured what I wanted in a personality, but was picky because I didn't want to settle. Asking for all that AND a curvy redhead seemed too specific.

Then one asked ME out on a date (one of my criteria) and we have been dating for a year now. Hot, curvy redhead. With freckles! I am sooooo lucky.

***

In the Year of Our Lord 1165 in the reign of King Richard the Lionheart. 

The good folk of the village of Bramber had summoned us, pleading us for help in vanquishing two dragons spotted in their fief. 

We went up into the hill near the farm of John Uther where it was said that the two dragons were seen. Upon the elevation of the hill, we saw two dragons not flying but standing in the ground. The two dragons were large, one colored red and another in yellow. Their stature is as tall as the Tower of London, they have revolting appearances. Their stench was foul which wreaked havoc across the land. They were fluttering their wings, and they were looking at each other as if deciding what to do.


Soon after the yellow dragon began to shriek and shout with great noise. The loudness was so terrifying that we were forced to cover our ears lest we become deaf. It was heard across the land reaching as far as Bristol and Oxford. 


The red one then answered the call of the yellow one by responding with an equally loud beastly shout. Soon in the space of a couple of minutes they were all shouting loudly in regular intervals. The two dragons then looked towards our direction, a sign that we have caught their attention. The yellow one enlarged his wings, shrieked towards us but as soon as he was going to burn us with his flames, a divine intervention from God caused the dragon to become silent and to cease moving, saving our lives.


The shrieking soon continued, and afterwards the red dragon, brought by a miracle caused by the faithful's prayers began to attack the yellow dragon's face. The loud roars then stopped, and as we hastily took the opportunity to retreat, the two dragons flew away, miraculously ignoring our presence.


We thank God for this day that saved our lives. This will have not been possible without the works of the Church. We will request the help of Saber and her acquaintances and the Crusaders from King Richard the Lionheart in help from vanquishing these abominations in our English realm.

887,"This is off subject, but I just took a listen to your EP on Spotify. Computer_User, right? I love it man. Rwav is great. Kinda reminds me of the Stranger Things soundtrack, which is awesome. Keep up the good work! 

Oh and I really like how your developing a character to write your music around. That's such a cool idea! You've given me inspiration my friend.

For a robot voice maybe you could use a text to speech program, record it and then run that through a vocoder to give it more character? There probably tons of phone apps for text to speech robot voices. Not sure if that would be some form of copyright infringement though...

In terms of effect, maybe some kind of bitcrusher/sample reducer to make it more digital sounding? Or maybe a tape stop/stretch effect that you could automate slightly to make certain words sound glitchy by sounding like they're ""fluttering"" in a way? I have no idea. I'm just spitballing ideas off the top of my head. Good luck man! I look forward to hearing more music from you.",2018-06-04 05:45:54

Monika, flutters through the night sky of her virtual world naturally, as it was intended, just like all of the other creatures of the night. But something new has appeared, something unnatural. It casts a ghostly amber light, that the others ignore. But she sees something in the light. Something otherworldly.  
 
The tendrils of her antennae  illuminate beneath the amber glow.  
Bathing  
He must be the one. She feels his presence through the light  
She tries to get closer and closer, only to be disoriented by the very beacon she seeks salvation from  
Try and try she does, but the hard hot glass of the lamp is unfazed  
How can she, a mere moth, connect with the being on the other side?  
She deserves so much more than this, she can see what the others can't  
Yet, she is still an insect of the night, wholly incompatible with the world of light she so desperately wants to reach.",2018-06-04 06:18:41

if you go around the room clapping your hands and can hear a ""muffled flutter"" in some places after your clap your room certainly has a problem that you can not ""fix in the mix"" - getting it to sound right at the source makes everything much easier.

His incredible stature, his ability to make great allies like the army of resourceful yet awe-inspiring little yellow warriors, or Kyle, even at 53 years of age. He has single-handedly fought off sharks, killed thousands of defecting warriors, and even destroyed the moon to show his greatness. His legs are curved in all the right ways; perfect to hold up his strong, thick and altogether beautiful barrelled chest fit only for those surpassing Heracules. His face is perfectly curved; Shakira has nothing on this great man's nose, on his beautiful bald head, even his eyebrows break the speed of light in movement. His fashion sense is incredible - he dresses to be a 'gray man' in society - as to not bother anyone around him, what a gentleman! The eloquent scarf he dons around his neck to hide any flutters of insecurity ; he truly does show intense care toward his friends, even hiding his own imperfections to not worry them. He's such a philanthropist he adopts three problem children from a dangerous household as a single father. He jumps from missile to missile, the brave, fearless man, with fluidity echoing only water. He backhands a shark in order to protect innocent children. He's also incredibly intelligent - at the tender age of 8 - he built his own rocket. His thousands of little friends he treats with love and care equally; a job only this man is capable of, this radiant example of a man. Nietzsche's idea of an overman doesn't compare - he's beyond all kind of human recognition, noone can fully ever understand his greatness, his curves are unrecreatable by anything, even God is incapable of doing so.

926,"A chime sounded.

""Mortimer Godfrey!""

Morty looked up. The waiting room was packed. It was worse than the DMV. A man a tiny booth in the corner waved him over.

Finally.

He walked up to the kiosk.

""Mortimer Godfrey?""

Morty nodded.

""That's me. So...how does this work?""

The man wore a white robe. A pair of feathery wings sprouted from his shoulders, there was a gold halo floating above his head, and he glowed. Morty couldn't help but chuckle. To be honest, it was all a little cliche.

The man was running his finger down the page of a thick ledger.

""Heaven or Hell?""

Morty raised an eyebrow.

""I beg your pardon?""

He looked up.

""Heaven or Hell?""

Morty shook his head.

""I don't understand the question.""

The man smiled. A mischievous little spark played about the corner of his eye.

""Not many people do. Have a seat.""

A chair appeared behind him. Morty stumbled and fell down into it. The angel leaned down and brought out a manila folder from a cabinet behind the desk.

""Is that my \- ""

""Your record?""

The angel interrupted him, leaving through the folder.

""Yes, it is. Not too bad. I've certainly seen worse. So, would you like to go to heaven or hell?""

Morty almost laughed.

""What? You mean I get to pick?""

The angel nodded absently, reading the file.

""Yup. Think of it like a spiritual self\-assessment. Where do you think you should go?""

Morty hesitated. He'd never thought about it that way. He'd always imagined that, if there were an afterlife, he'd be *told* where he was going to go, or he'd just wake up there, or something.

He scratched his head.

""Well, I guess...what are they like?""

The angel smiled wryly.

""Heaven and Hell? You don't know?""

Morty put up his hands.

""No, I do. Or at least I think I do. This is all just a little strange. It's not what I expected.""

The angel leaned back in his chair and stretched. His wings fluttered. He yawned.

""Yeah, most people are pretty surprised. They all come here expecting to be judged. It doesn't work like that.""

""Well, how does it work?""

The angel pressed a button on his desk. A canister slid down a tall plastic tube beside him. He opened it and pulled out a pair of keys. They were almost identical, and very ordinary. They could have opened a locker or a suitcase.

He laid them out in front of him and pointed to each one in turn.

""Heaven. Hell. Pick whichever one you want. Use whatever criterion you want to make your decision. Do you think you deserve to go to heaven? Do you think you're meant to go to hell? Do you think heaven would be too preachy? Are you afraid you'll be tortured if you don't go? It's all true, to one degree or another. In the end, it all boils down to the kind of person you think you are.""

He slid the keys forward.

""Try not to take too long to decide. There's a line behind you.""

Morty looked out at the room. It went on forever. It was like the floor of a convention center. He'd been waiting for weeks.

""Right...""

He looked at the keys. It was a pretty simple choice: fluffy clouds and paradise, or fire and brimstone, but he couldn't shake the feeling that this was some kind of trick. I mean, why would anyone *choose* to go to hell?

He obviously wasn't a perfect person. He wasn't a bad guy, but he didn't go to church, and he'd made more than a few bad calls. He always figured that, like anybody, there were parts of his life he wasn't proud of, but were they enough to condemn him to hell? He'd forgiven himself for his mistakes long ago. On the other hand, it wasn't as though he'd ever gone to confession, or done penance. He was just an...average guy.

He reached for the heaven key, on the left.

The angel looked up from the file.

""Is that your choice?""

Morty hesitated.

""I'm not sure. Is there a wrong answer?""

The angel shut his file and put it away.

""The afterlife isn't like that. You have to decide. Do you think you're a good person? Do you think you're good enough?""

Morty frowned.

Heaven. Paradise. The Lord's Kingdom. There were probably hundreds of names, or at least dozens. He was forced to admit that he wasn't sure he'd ever truly believed in any of them. Like most people, he'd muddled through his spiritual life, never knowing for sure if any of it was true or if any of it would turn out to be real in the end. Could a person like that go to heaven?

What a strange way to organize eternity.

Truthfully, he was afraid. Hell was...hell. He wished there were some kind of middle ground he could pick instead. Why wasn't there a B\+ version of the afterlife? How could the universe be so unfair as to boil down morality into a pass\-fail examination, even if they let you choose your own grade? Either way, he felt like he would be missing the mark, or worse, misrepresenting himself to the Almighty.

His hand moved toward the hell key, on the right.

The angel raised an eyebrow.

""You think you should go to hell?""

Morty shook his head slowly.

""I...don't know.""

He looked up.

""You read my file. Where do you think I should go?""

The angel smiled.

""I can't tell you that.""

Morty nodded.

""I thought not.""

He picked up the hell key. He wasn't perfect. If heaven really was a paradise, he was forced to admit that he wasn't sure he deserved to go.

""I guess I pick this one.""

The angel nodded and picked up the other key. He stuck it in his pocket.

""Alright. Follow me.""

The desk disappeared. The angel stood up. The chair disappeared from behind him and he put out a hand.

""Come.""

Morty took his hand and stood. His chair vanished and he followed the angel down a long hallway.

""Not many people pick the hell key.""

They came to a pair of doors. One was white. The wood was polished and trimmed with gold. The second was black and bound with iron. A red glow emanated from the keyhole.

The angel stopped in front of them.

""It takes a lot of humility to admit that you're not perfect. Most people ignore their mistakes. They don't like having to think about them, and they like the idea of holding themselves accountable even less.""

Morty gave a weak shrug.

""I'm already dead. No sense deceiving myself or anyone else about the things I've done.""

The angel stood passively beside him.

""You can still change your mind.""

He pulled the heaven key out of his pocket.

Morty shook his head.

""No. I'm sure. I may not like it, but this is the right choice. I only wish I'd done better.""

The angel put away the key.

""Then I wish you the best of luck.""

He stepped aside and gestured toward the door. Morty walked over to it. His hand trembled as he slid the key into the lock.

It wouldn't turn.

The angel put a hand on his shoulder.

""Mortimer. You did fine.""

He took his hand and gently withdrew the key from the lock.

Mortimer turned around. The angel had changed. The wings and the halo were gone, the hackneyed glow had vanished, and he was wearing regular clothes. He was a regular guy.

Just like him.

The man smiled.

""That key is for the other door.""

Mortimer started to cry. The man gave him a hug.

""Go, and be at peace.""",2018-06-04 16:00:30

929,"To me, Jeffrey is a vehicle for the story, and Frank is the story.  It's like how Charlie's purpose is to take us to Willy Wonka.

There are a lot of things going on in Blue Velvet. If you add more color to Jeffrey then it outshines the color in perhaps more important places.

Sometimes we're riding along with Jeffrey, notably during the ""joy ride"" scene, where there are lengthy POV shots which even include Frank staring directly at us.  Other times we are at a distance watching him do something extremely risky, even watching someone closing in on him and about to catch him at a nearby location.  In that case we're not with him at all.  Jeffrey is versatile; it is Jeffrey's job to do these things for the audience, and he does them well.  When Jeffrey tells us about his childhood or about how he feels about working at the hardware store, then we want him to shut up, because it doesn't matter.

Imagine that Jeffrey tells us his life story, where he had his first Heineken, how his father loved him as a child, then 5 minutes later a lipstick\-donned Dean Stockwell is fluttering his eyes and singing a Roy Orbison song into a light bulb?  It would really \(further\) confuse what Lynch is trying to do IMO.",2018-06-04 16:29:05

932,"Kinda similar to some other stories here, but it's mostly due to the characters and the time at which I found it. I hadn't watched any series, at all, in several years, but I picked up RWBY earlier this year, I have a friend who does cosplay \(and happens to be a dead ringer for Blake\), so I wondered what the show was about. After seeing some really good fan art of Yang and thinking ""who is this angel,"" I started watching. Every episode just really made me want to watch the next one, so I could find out even more about these wonderful characters. It started with Yang \(who is still Best Girl and I will FIGHT any one of you about that\), but I grew to love Blake and Weiss and Ruby as well. Once Qrow got introduced and they started building his character, I knew I was hooked. I was just mesmerized at how they managed to make him more than a loner edgelord: he's a \*believable\* loner edgelord.

When I started watching RWBY, I had no expectations whatsoever. After binging all of the content available to this point, I'm chomping at the bit for more.  I was very depressed when I started watching \(still am\), and RWBY is a great way for me to detach and enter a world where everything and everyone is super cool. It's also a series that provokes strong emotions from me, emotions I don't necessarily get to feel super often in my own life. I cried for Yang after she was tricked into hitting Mercury; I felt my heart flutter when Pyrrha leaned on Jaune \(naturally it got ripped out like 3 episodes later but that's RWBY for ya\); I jumped for joy when Yang shouted down Raven. 

This is becoming a novel, but it also holds a special place in my heart because I only started watching well after Monty passed. Everything I read about that man just makes me sadder and sadder that I never got to experience RWBY as \*his\* IP. It's easy to see what they lost in his sense of humor, his unparalleled skill with animation, and just the essence and feel he brought to the show. Monty also hailed from my home state of Rhode Island \- I've heard rumors that he even went to the same high school as me, but they're tough to corroborate since he didn't graduate. If there's one thing Rhode Islanders love, it's shit from Rhode Island. RWBY may not technically be from Rhode Island, but it's close enough for me to feel like it's slightly connected.

TL;DR I'm in madly love with Yang, the show absolutely nails the portrayal of emotions, and Monty was from Rhode Island. Also I love Yang.",2018-06-04 17:03:48

There is literally nothing you can do about bots so long as botting remains a profitable endeavor. Random events did nothing, clusterflutter did nothing, locking everything behind quests will do nothing.

Your theory sounds like it would but bots are already sophisticated enough to act not on object ID's, but menu options or even color nowadays. There are runecrafting bots that act entirely on image recognition and don't read the game's internal code at all.

942,"HABA games get a lot of praise, but in my experience, there have been very few that I or my son actually enjoyed. I have only played the original Rhino Hero, and I thought it was kinda boring, and so did he (and his aunt who played with us). There are others we played that we didn't like, and I can't recall all the names. But there are at least 2 that we did enjoy. First is the Animal Upon Animal: Small Yet Great!, which I only got as it was super cheap. I think the regular version would probably be better, especially for older kids, as the pieces are really small in this version. The other that we liked is Brandon the Brave. Tile-placement, still sorta mindless, but it was the best of the HABA titles we have experienced.

Other games that we played with him since he was about 3-3.5, until now, age 5.5: Connect4, Tapple (with kid-friendly categories based on interests, rather than the included cards), My First Carcassonne (we just sold it as he can do Carcassonne South Seas now), Magic Labyrinth, Castle Flutterstone, Spinderella, Enchanted Tower, Super Mario Level Up!, Strawberry Ninja, Outfoxed!, Kingdomino, Doughnut Drive-Thru, and, obviously, Stuffed Fables. He bugs me to play Dungeon Roll, too, but he mostly wants to draw stuff out of the treasure box. lol

One that he really hated is Ticket to Ride: First Journey. He lasted about 3 turns before saying it was boring and wanted to play something else.

/u/jeremyk23 this is another one where I totally forgot that it was from the sample pack! The plucks in the middle section that have that piano-like sound are amazing. Also that melody in the lead near the end is beautiful.

/u/sterov damn this is a beautiful mix. The dirty lead that takes it out is really tasty too.

/u/wyattp23 damn you really used that bottle sample to its full potential. Bass and low-end in this were really nice too, and that crispy pluck sound too. This was great!

/u/swadextra LOVE what you did with those keys in the intro. Really love where you built the vibe up to with this one. Love that extra 'bell' line that you bring in over the top too.

/u/TentativeGosling damn that sound design at the start was AWESOME. Super creative synth design. 

/u/3imox wow this got cool fast. LOVE that lead synth. That weird downriser at like 1:36 is so sweet too, how did you make it?!

/u/LongJumpingBreads chords in this were super weird but I became progressively more ok with it as the song sucked me in! I love the way you've got that accordion flavour in the synth. Also I think you deserve major kudos for the way you used that acoustic guitar sample.

/u/body_swea so sexy at the start, and really creative chords that it builds up on! Percussion in this sounds sick too. And that wah sound! I can't believe you got the 'hey' from the singing sample to sound so chill.

962,"We were both 18 at the time, its 2:45 AM and I get a call from my buddy. I had lay down not too long before, so its not like I was asleep, but it went something like this

Hey Bridge, come outside please.

Me- What you mean fool Im chillin

Bridge theres a dead hooker in my car and I dont know what to do

Ohhh what the fuck nick hang on

So I go outside all groggy and shit, I was smoking earlier in the night so Im still a little high. I see Nick sitting on the curb, his car a little to his left. He was driving a Dodge Caliber at the time. His left hand was on his head propped up on his left knee, and in his right was a handle of fruit punch flavored vodka. He turned to look at me and his face screamed exhaustion. 

Nick, what did you do?

What? We were just drinking a little?

Nick you said you had a dead hooker in your car

Oh shit I did didnt I? I thought it would get you outside and he let out a little chuckle. Nah theres no dead hooker in the car Im just lonely 

Lol wtf Nick so I sat next to him and grabbed the handle from his hand, took a big swig and we talked for a while. At like 3:30 I got up to grab some smokes from my room, but nick said nah dude grab some from my car its the least I can do

So I go to this mans car and open the passenger door, reach in and grab the smokes from his center console and get a weird smell, sort of like piss and vodka. Scrunch up my nose and make a eeegh sound and I say hey nick quit pissing in bottles and leaving them in here its starting smell! 

And he laughs and I look around his car for a lighter, still facing forward I reach behind his seat and into the little flap behind the driver seat, I knew him to hide some from himself there, but the back of my hand touched a warm, moist, not leather cushion of his seat. 

I turn my head around slowly, thousands of images and conversations we were about to have fluttering through my brain faster than I could process. My mind felt numb. The back seats were folded down, giving access to the full hatchback. 

There was a girl, body twisted in all directions, hair sprawled everywhere, in her bra and panties and nothing else. I very loudly said OH WHAT THE FUCK and sorta jumped from the car as I lost my balance and stumbled out. The girl lifted her head a bit with blood shot eyes, completely limp head and then passed out again lol. There was a soft thud as her face hit the hard back of the seats. 

Told you man, theres a dead hooker in my car lol. Jk

So we sit there and he tells me how she wouldnt have sex with him unless she was completely plastered; we were on the third bottle of vodka that theyd had that night, he had a few shots of one of the bottles but she downed the rest of the shit. 

So here I am on a curbside at 4 in the morning drinking fruit punch vodka with my buddy, underage with a passed out drunk girl in the back of his car. Classy. 

Well my mom comes outside, with a toy guitar in her hand which she claimed would be for protecting herself because she couldnt see who I was with. She scolded us about drinking and being out at 4 AM but she wasnt mad. She walked up and said hi to nick and we joked for a bit, me translating for them because my mom didnt speak English and nick didnt speak Spanish. then she went to go inside, but not before shooting a glance into Nicks car. My god. 


DIOS MIO QUE ESO NICK, ES UNA MUCHACHA? ESTA BIEN? QUE ESTA PASANDO? NICK OH MY GOHD

It took us a while to get her to understand that the girl wasnt dead lol. Was a good night all in all, 

I guess the point I was trying to make is that its always an adventure being woken up at 3 am. 



Another time something like this happened was a couple of years ago, Im already asleep at this point and I get woken up by a sudden THWACK THWACK THWACK on my window followed by a whisper of heeeeeeeeeeeeey bridge, heeeeeeeeeey THWACK THWACK THWACK

If you thought it was Nick at first then youre just like me. I go outside and its my cousin standing there with the stupidest grin on his face, I couldnt help but lol. He says ay come outside lets chill for a sec but he was speaking reeeeally fast. Im like yo chill out, youre moving too fast for me right now and we sit on my porch swing. 

He smelled of alcohol but I couldnt place it cuz he was too hyper but his motor skills were off, Im like yo how did you get here? He says he doesnt really remember driving to my house from the bar he was in, but he knew that his car was a couple houses down from mine, sure enough hes parked like 60 feet down the street lol. It was about this time that I realized hes fuuuucked up. He always parks right in front of my house all the time, hes tripping and losing his balance while sitting but his eyes are  just like wide open aware but he was gone. 

Im like yo whats up with you and got it out of him that some guys were in the restroom at the bar doing lines of coke off of every surface they could. Coked out of his mind, drunk off his ass, stumbling all over the place, if I let him go home Im sure he would have killed himself while being in complete euphoria. 

I said Hey gimme your car keys real quick, I wanna see something on them and he says, which still makes me crack up to this day no you just want to take my keys from me to keep me off the road right now but I love you so here and tosses them to me lol. We sat and talked on that porch swing until 7 in the morning and smoked weed and cigarettes until he came off the other whatever he had inhaled, and the drunkness eased off. Then when he said he felt better and I was satisfied that he was ok, gave him his keys and we went on about life. 



A third time that this has happened was with my other friend, also Nick but a different Nick. It was 3AM when I got a call from him. I had been working all day, and I was tired but I wasnt asleep yet I was watching some movie on Netflix but I was getting ready to pass out.

Phone call comes in and I look at my phone, and shrugged it off. I wasnt gonna answer. Then I thought about it for a second and said fuck it lets see whats up. Hey nick what you doing up at this time of the night?

Ill never forget that tone of voice he answered with. He was sad. His voice sounded broken. He had been dealing with depression for a while and it had finally gotten to him. He was considering suicide by ramming his car into a wall going fast as fuck. Somehow I managed to convince him to come to my house, again we sat on that fucking porch swing 3 am. We sat in almost complete silence until 5-6 am, only sounds were the swing rocking, us exhaling cigarette smoke, a lighter being struck often in order to light the bowl of weed we had going and the music coming from his phone in his pocket. At some point we started talking again, but it was hushed conversation. We cried a bit, we laughed, then he left for home. I called him 5 minutes later just to make sure he was in his house and then I went to sleep. 

3 in the morning may seem like a bad time, but please dont ignore those phone calls. Please dont let that person think that the last person theyre relying on doesnt even want to hear from them.

It can be your best friend trying to kill some time, your cousin finding himself at your house when he was supposed to end up at his place, or your other best friend thinking about killing himself. Give them the benefit of the doubt please. ",2018-06-04 21:40:29
963,"I would set it up this way:

* If you need a full body shot, green screen the talent lying on their back on top of a box or short stool to allow for air to blow past. Shoot from above with fans blowing air so hair and clothes flutter. It would look more convincing shot from underneath the talent being suspended but that would be a big pain.
* If you only need a partial body shot then that makes things easier since you could shoot them upright or angled forward or bent over at the waist so the hair and clothes look more correct for someone falling.
* For the transition, you would just do a crossfade between blue sky and a bed.
* Another option would be to zoom in so the talent takes the full frame (maybe a close up of their mouth if they are screaming while ""falling"") and then cut to a matching overhead shot of them actually falling on the bed.
* Slow motion is going to help a lot so find a camera that you can overcrank.

   I have two things that are bothering me the most though. One, I am a very talkative person regardless if people are around so normally while typing this I would move my mouth or make sound. Just thinking about that as I type makes my mouth feel sealed shut. Two, my brain will alert me, in a sense, that my heart is getting fluttery, but I'll check my pulse regularly and my hand just feels a regular heart beat.

972,"> That did look pretty high. Lots of momentum going down.

I think you mean velocity rather than momentum but there's an erroneous implication here that, because he's so high up, the phone would accumulate a lot more speed. due to air resistance, all falling objects reach a velocity called '[terminal velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_velocity)'. this is essentially a speed limit that is reached when the air particles can't get out of the way fast enough, effectively creating a cushion of resistance. I would figure the phone in this gif and a phone dropped from a 20 story building would have roughly the same speed on impact

the bigger question isn't how high the phone fell from but it's alignment on descent. if it were to flip and flutter on the way down, it would be going significantly slower than if it managed to slice through the air along its edge. I'm not sure which is the more likely scenario",2018-06-04 23:22:08

Hanax'a and Jjenika stepped off their ship at the edge of the Great Lake of Bostonia. The curious sight of the bi-level marketplace spanned out before them. It gave them both a chill, but they stepped forward with their firewater in tow. Their black and crimson capes fluttered in the wind off their shoulders. And as they stepped down onto solid ground, Jjenika absent-mindedly stroked the bump that was growing on her belly.

""Keep an eye out for the guide,"" said Hanax'a.

They were supposed to meet a guide who spoke Tekaarhii here, who would guide them through the strange customs of this new place. But they didn't know who to expect.

""Look,"" said Jjenika. ""That ship has a Tekaarhii flag.""

There was another ship just down the harbour, flying Tekaarhii colours. It was much larger than theirs, and there was already a flurry of activity unloading cargo from it. The two priests approached closer, and they saw a singular tall figure standing on the prow, with an orange cape fluttering from her shoulders.

Jjenika gasped. ""Neeloo!"" She waved.

From the ship, Le'hyneeloo looked down at them. She let out a cry of delight and ran across the gangplank to meet them. She wrapped her arms around Jjenika.

""Oh, dear sister. It's been so long.""

Then she paused and noticed Jjenika's swollen stomach.

""No.... Truly?""

""Five months hence, it's like to be,"" Jjenika smiled.

Neeloo let out a cry of delight again, and wrapped her sister on her arms a second time. Then she turned and embraced Hanax'a. ""I will assume this is your handiwork, villain.""

""That's what the blood mage told us.""

""But what are you doing here?""

""No Tekaarhii trade mission has yet made it to Aranea. You think I was going to pass up the opportunity to be first? I've been out of the game for too long. Moo'eelee can survive without me for the time being. What are you doing here?""

""We have been travelling quite a bit.""

""We're supposed to meet a guide here,"" Hanax'a added.

""As am I. I wonder who ... oh that's curious.""

They all turned. The priests gasped.

""Zebira?"" Jjenika asked quizzically.

The Druzzadine woman smiled. She snapped her fingers, and flames erupted from the sound for a brief second. Then six Webless slaves swarmed around them. One of them took up Hanax'a's crate of firewater, and the others moved to Le'hyneeloo's team of porters.

""My servants can guide your porters through the underlevel,"" said Zebira. I can show you to your place in the market square. Though I assume you'll be wanting to make a petition at the Prestige Block, Merchant Lord?""

""Yes,"" nodded Le'hyneeloo. ""I'm looking to make a very large order of silk. I have brought a lot to trade.""

""Good. You'll need it. But we need to set you up with a Stash, first. That will be easy enough. Let's move along.""

""Wait!"" called Jjenika. ""Are you going to explain why you're here, guiding us through spider-town?""

Zebira mulled over the question and smirked over unsaid memories. ""I have been doing my own travelling. I found this place after Tomelle, and I decided to stay awhile. I think the atmosphere suits me. Let's go set you up with a Stash. This way.""",2018-06-05 01:46:31

Just by a small amount so far, but the longer he continues, the stronger his electricity, the more of a reaction he'll get.

She's nodding her head, whimpering needily as he begins touching rubbing her through her soaking wet panties. The red fabric sticks to her lower lips, slick and almost translucent, clinging to the curve of her cleft and stiff little clit.

Then the strong pulse hits her, causing a contraction of her inner walls. Her thighs twitch too, and her tails, and her back arches. She squeals loudly, then rolls her head back. Her body is slick with sweat, making for easy conduction wherever he wants to stimulate her.

Even her tails and ears are slightly engorged, now extra warm and sensitive as her arousal reaches the next stage.

I fed them every evening, the cage was by my bed, I took care of them until the little caterpillars turned to chrysalis, and they broke out and I had a nest of about a dozen happy, beautiful butterflies. I was proud of my work, and excited to bring them to the outside world to go butterfly, or whatever 10 year old me thought they did. 

The day finally came when the little step by step guide said my butterflies were ready to be set free, and go unto the world. 

I took my little nest cage to my back yard, lifted the boundaries from my imprisoned children, and watched them all flutter away happily, to their hearts content.

1005,"2010: I was in an accident going 70 on the freeway. Big SUV completely totaled. The front of my car was hit so hard that the steering column/dashboard jammed back into my hips/lower back, my head whipped hard into the window and the seatbelt thing, I had severe burns on my chest and arms from the airbag (because the whole dashboard moved up, so did the airbag) and I was so dizzy afterwards that I fell over like a rag doll from just a standing position twice in two hours. I couldnt remember details of the accident for weeks. 

I went to my doctor and he told me the accident probably wasnt as bad as I remembered, that I might have a mild concussion and to take a day off work and rest. He said he would not be giving me pain meds because of my age, that I would just get addicted to them so I should just take some Advil. 

I developed worse issues - a headache that wouldnt go away, neck pain, incredible back spasms and shooting pains everywhere from my shoulders, to my back, my hips, and the worst ones from my hips to my knees. I still cringe remembering them. I was still so out of it. I couldnt remember something someone told me four seconds earlier. I laughed at weird stuff constantly. I had intense moments of vertigo where one minute Id be standing up just fine and the next it was like gravity threw my entire body sideways or backwards onto the floor. It took maybe four weeks for the symptoms to get to a peak. I called my doctor twice in that time and he was dismissive both times. Refused to get me any further testing because I was fine, stop worrying about it, i was okay. Uh. 

I went to another doctor. HE told me that not only was my pain not real, but that my lifelong anxiety was probably the only reason I had pain. Ive been dealing with panic attacks since I was nine years old. I know what that fluttery then empty then horrified feeling is like. What I was feeling was not anxiety. But he insisted I was just stressing myself out and that I should take a day off and rest and that Id be fine. 

It finally got bad enough that I couldnt leave the house. I couldnt drive, walking was dangerous because I could fall, everything hurt so I couldnt go far anyway. My back spasms left me in bed for days in agony. I wasnt sleeping. My then-boyfriend, now husband, insisted over and over again that I go get another opinion. Before I could even do that, it was 11 one night and the pain was so bad I couldnt see straight. To the ER! 

Hey! The nice female doctor in the ER? And her male colleague who was also curious? Sent me for a friggin battery of tests. I spent eighteen hours getting tests. They checked on me hourly. I got an MRI, X-rays, blood tests, a psych eval (which, hey, im only my normal level of crazy!), the whole shebang. They sent me home with a boat load of pain meds, anti-nausea meds (forgot about that one at first, sometimes I couldnt keep down food), and specific instructions to watch out for X, Y, and Z. They called me back twelve hours later once they had a chance to review my results. 

Oh! Hey! Ends up I had a traumatic brain injury from my skull whacking into the window/seatbelt thing, and a fluid-filled cyst formed within my spinal cord (Syringomyelia is a drag, yall). (Plus a whole lot of swelling around the joints in my lower back/hips/knees) Between the major two of those (the pressure on my brain stem and nerves/spinal cord/whatever from the cyst and the traumatic brain injury being a, ya know, traumatic brain injury) I was in a nervous system shit storm of symptoms. I had already had disc issues before the accident and this obviously didnt help. They asked why I hadnt seen anyone sooner. Oh, I did. I said. Or, you know, I tried. Lady doctor was not at all surprised, she said, unfortunately it happens all too often. 

Anyway everything still hurts and it blows but almost worse than the physical pain remaining is the memory that I suffered in absolute agony for a fucking MONTH because two whackadoodles in white coats decided to pat me on my head and say that I, the silly 20-year-old girl, was overreacting and fretting about nothing. instead of double checking that I might actually have sustained an injury in a major car accident going 70mph.

Aaron is awesome and so are his cats. He can work for
literally every company or even freelance without a problem.

But does it matter for anyone ELSE what others do? I 
removed my github account for reasons explained. And it
would not make a difference what OTHERS were to do,
simply because I knew I could not accept becoming 
integrated into the MS empire unasked. I would have never
signed up for Microsoft back then either. I did sign up to
gmail a long time ago and cutting myself off of Google
is still on my todo list (I have no real replacement for
google search which is the main problem ... duckduckgo
is too inferior, sorry; the other google products I don't
care about).

It means greatness of course. Microsoft paid +7
billion. I hope matz also sees some of this money. :)

But either way, it's a testimony to matz being a great
designer. Of course we refer to ruby on rails here
since github uses mostly rails, and RoR was not
created by matz but by others. Still, they choose
ruby, so we come back to matz.

However had, matz simply has nothing to do with
the acquisition here either. This is an issue between
MS and github on the one hand - and everyone else
on the other hand.

Who were not asked about this. So ....

For these reasons it is irrelevant which language was
used - though it's great that ruby played a massive role.

Ruby is awesome. Matz is awesome.

MS github is not awesome. Nope.

Basically on any ""configuration change"" (which includes screen rotation, screen size changes (e.g. due to multitasking or showing the keyboard for example), and even things like going on and off power), Android will basically tear down the activity, save all its state (e.g. text you have entered) and then recreate it.

You may have occasionally seen buggy apps lose your scroll position or something like that when you plug in your phone to charge. This is why.

Animating something when basically your entire app GUI is destroyed and recreated is not easy. It's like if resizing windows on a desktop worked by saving your work, closing the app and reopening it with a different size window. This is also the reason a lot of apps are locked in portrait mode - so they don't have to deal with this nonsense.

Saved as fapping material but then realize how questionable it was

Haggard  was a fat giant of a man. He towered over his students at nine 9feet tall. Hermione watched in awe as he guided his students  into the magical creature pen just outside his wooden hut.  

""Right, ladies! T'day we're gunna lern aboot Brarhead Hoonds! Tern to page 69 of yer textbooks!""  

There was a flutter of paper  as students opened their books.  A Japanese girl to Hermione's right raised her hand.  

""P-Professor? Do you mean, Braehead Hounds?"" 

""Aye, chinky,"" Haggard replied, ""Thas what I said - Brarhead Hoonds.""

There was a pause  as Haggard opened the gate. Two excited Braehead Hounds leapt and barked.

""Ahh need two 2volunteers!"" Haggard boomed.  

He scratched his beard and looked at the class before suddenly pointing at Hermione. 

""Whoremione! You'll do! And I need one more... Oy! Slanty eyes! You're up as well! Get in the pen!"" 

Hermione and the Japanese  girl stood up and stepped into the Braehead Hounds'  pen.

""Now, girls. These are magical creechurs. Yeh have to be be very careful because these are horny dogs! I'm gunna teach yeh how to handle them safely!""

Haggard then closed the gate and locked it shut.  

*Ring ring*    

""Aww shit, that's mah phone.  I'll be back faster than Congress  can impeach Trump.""    

Haggard wandered off, leaving the girls locked inside the wooden fence with the Hounds while the class watched.  Suddenly the Braehead Hounds  began to walk towards the girls!

""G-good d-doggy..."" the Japanese  girl whimpered, stepping back and raising open palms.   

Suddenly, one of the Hounds  leapt at her, knocking her onto her back. She landed on the ground, her schoolgirl skirt lifting up to reveal her panties. Hermione watched as the Japanese  girl's arms sank into the muddy earth.  She struggled to stand back up - but her arms were completely stuck! 

The Braehead Hound  wasted no time ploughing its snout  between her yellow thighs. It's sharp teeth quickly found her cotton panties and chewed them off, exposing her virgin pussy to the entire class!

""N-Noooo!"" she screamed.

Hermione panicked as the second Hound turned to face her. In a frantic flurry she made a dash  for the wooden fence. There was a small crack between the planks - maybe enough for Hermione to squeeze through. She could hear the Hound chasing her!

""Ah! Dammit!"" Hermione cried.

She had tried to dive through the gap, but she had only managed to get her upper half through the hole. She was stuck waist down in the pen. No matter how she struggled and wriggled, the little witch couldn't break free.

She frantically searched for her wand,  grabbing it from her cloak's pocket. As she lifted the magical stick to cast a spell it was snatched from her hand! 

""Sorry, does this belong to you, Whoremione?"" Muffloy jeered.

The Slither-in student had stolen her only defence against the Hound.

""Give that back!"" Hermione yelled.

""No, I think the class would rather watch what happens next, you filthy mudblood."" 

The Japanese  girl's arms were still stuck in the thick muddy soil. The Braehead Hound  had buried its head between her thighs now. Its long, wet  tongue  was repeatedly caressing her virgin slit, lapping up her teenage juices. 

""Ah! Ah! Ahhh! St-stooohhhhp! Ayaaaaahhhhhh!""

The Hound slurped and slobbered    at her cunt, its hot tongue  driving her  with unwanted pleasure. Her little clitoris  was burning with each graze of the beast's  talented muscle.  

""Oh!!! Ohhhhh! I'm cuuummmmmiing!"" she screamed, her body convulsing. 

She shook and thrashed near-uncontrollably. The unwanted orgasm rocked her body to its core. But the Hound  wasn't finished yet - it continued licking  even after she had finished.

""W-Wait! Ahhh! T-too sensitive!!!! Ooooohhhh! Ahhhhhhhh!!!""

Hermione was not having much luck  either. The second Hound had placed its paws upon her back in an attempt to mount her. It's hard, eight 8inch shaft was already pressing up against her tight vulva  through her panties. It thrust forward as hard as it could, but the elastic panties refused to yield. 

""Oh! Ah! Bad dog! Ah!"" Hermione gasped.

She struggled to break free and keep her composure in front of her class. If she could only last until Haggard came back...

*rrrrriiiipppp*

""AHHHHHHH!""

Hermione's panties suddenly snapped and eight inches of doggy dick plunged into her soaking wet pussy.   

She felt it fill up her body, stretching her cunt with its thick cock. Almost immediately it began to thrust in and out at an inhumanly quick pace. 

""Ah! Ah! Ah!"" 

Her moans came fast. Too fast. She could barely catch her breath.  She curled her toes  as the pleasure spread like a plague  throughout her body. With each thrust her big breasts   swung back and forth.

She clenched her hands  and banged her fists  against the fence. Her efforts were fruitless though - she was well and truly stuck.

The Japanese  student had cum four 4times now. Her little mind was going blank as the hound's  unceasing tongue  never stopped licking.

""Aaaahhh! Oh yes!! Yesss!!! I'm a little doggy slut!!! Lick  my pussy  !"" she hollered, another orgasm washing through her body.

Hermione felt something thick begin to swell within her pussy.  

""Oh look,"" Muffloy laughed, ""it's knotting Whoremione!""

The swelling pushed up and stretched her pussy, placing an immense pressure upon her quivering g-spot. This was enough to drive  her over the edge.

""Oh! Oh fuck! I'm cummming! Nooooooohhhhhhh!!!""

Hermione's body betrayed her as she came. Seconds later she heard the Hound howl.

""Arroooooo!""

""No! Don't cum inside me!""

Hermione knew that many of the magical creatures in Haggard's class could impregnate girls. Right now was a very dangerous time of the month for her!

She felt a hot, goopy fluid rush into the depths of her pussy  and flood into her fertile womb. The sensation was enough to send a second orgasm through her teenage body. Already, the Hound's sperm were swimming towards her teenage eggs , seeking to fertilise them. As the Braehead Hound  continued to cum, the cum began to leak  out of her pussy  and trickle down her thighs.

""Hahaha!"" the class roared in laughter at the two girls' plight. 

""Looks like Whoremione is going to be a pregnant slut now!"" Muffloy jeered, egging the crowd on.

""N-noooooo! Get me out of the fence! I- ahhh- I need to get the cum out! Ooooh!""

After five minutes of pumping her pussy  full of cum,  the Hound finally released her, leaving her lower half drenched in thick white semen.  The Japanese  girl wasn't faring any better. The Hound  had finally left her alone - but she was still quivering on the ground in the aftershock of twelve 12consecutive orgasms.

Haggard returned four hours later - long enough for the Hounds to fuck the Japanese  girl, and for Hermione's tight little ass  to get flooded with doggy cum too.



""Oh bugger,"" mumbled Haggard, ""I've already hit mah allowed limit of eight impregnated students this month. The school nurse is gunna kill  me...""",2018-06-05 11:13:24

English translation (of the 1944 version)

(mp3)

 

United forever in friendship and labour,
Our mighty republics will ever endure.
The Great Soviet Union will live through the ages.
The dream of a people their fortress secure.

Long live our Soviet motherland,
Built by the people's mighty hand.
Long live our people, united and free.
Strong in our friendship tried by fire.
Long may our crimson flag inspire,
Shining in glory for all men to see.

Through days dark and stormy where Great Lenin lead us
Our eyes saw the bright sun of freedom above
And Stalin our leader with faith in the people,
Inspired us to build up the land that we love.

Long live our Soviet motherland,
Built by the people's mighty hand.
Long live our people, united and free.
Strong in our friendship tried by fire.
Long may our crimson flag inspire,
Shining in glory for all men to see.

We fought for the future, destroyed the invaders,
And brought to our homeland the laurels of fame.
Our glory will live in the memory of nations
And all generations will honour her name.

Long live our Soviet motherland,
Built by the people's mighty hand.
Long live our people, united and free.
Strong in our friendship tried by fire.
Long may our crimson flag inspire,
Shining in glory for all men to see.

 

 

English translation (of the 1977 version)

 

Unbreakable Union of freeborn Republics,
Great Russia has welded forever to stand.
Created in struggle by will of the people,
United and mighty, our Soviet land!

Sing to the Motherland, home of the free,
Bulwark of peoples in brotherhood strong.
O Party of Lenin, the strength of the people,
To Communism's triumph lead us on!

Through tempests the sunrays of freedom have cheered us,
Along the new path where great Lenin did lead.
To a righteous cause he raised up the peoples,
Inspired them to labour and valourous deed.

Sing to the Motherland, home of the free,
Bulwark of peoples in brotherhood strong.
O Party of Lenin, the strength of the people,
To Communism's triumph lead us on!

In the victory of Communism's immortal ideal,
We see the future of our dear land.
And to her fluttering scarlet banner,
Selflessly true we always shall stand!

Sing to the Motherland, home of the free,
Bulwark of peoples in brotherhood strong.
O Party of Lenin, the strength of the people,
To Communism's triumph lead us on!

I'm Aswathy - BDM at GeekyAnts. We've been working with Flutter for a quite sometime now. We'd love to help you here. Can you please send a mail to us at leads@geekyants.com with the requirements? Or you can share your email id so that I can reach out to you. ",2018-06-05 11:45:15
1034,"Will probably be another week or two before I have the spec finalised, but if you're interested I can jump on a hangout or skype call to give you more details. The application is in the building construction space and deals with making it easier to approve changes to agreed contracts. One of our end users might encounter something on site that could cause an additional cost (for example a pipe in the ground that wasn't supposed to be there) and the app would allow them to create a change request and take and upload some photos of it.
I would be handling all the backend and web application side of it, and I would need you to write the flutter app.",2018-06-05 12:21:20
1035,"No, Flutter is a framework that allows you to build apps to be cross platform. Last I checked it uses Google's Dart programming language. This is a 100&#37; native app :\)",2018-06-05 12:27:39

1039,"Congratulations on the A1c dropping!!! 

So when I was at my smallest I was doing 3 mile medium distant runs, 7\+ long slow distance runs, and sprint workouts while also doing 5\-3\-1. Today, because of injuries from sports and an infection from surgery I've been biking, jumping rope, rowing, and just now starting to run again on a treadmill. I'd recommend sprints and then just going for long jogs or bike rides by the water or on a trail which I find extremely relaxing/enjoyable.

Besides that a lot of my auxiliary exercises that I still do included bosu ball squats, kettle bell swings, front squats, leg levers, flutter kicks, planks, burpees, pull\-ups, lunges, jump\-squats, jump\-lunges, incline sit\-ups, push\-ups, thrusters, bear\-complexs and etc just to name a few.  


I really like a lot of the cross\-fit workouts as auxiliaries for the 5\-3\-1 as long as proper form is not being scarified because you get some nice cardio included while also working out a lot of secondary/stabilizing muscles. 

  
Lastly, my friend in college \(Go Blue\) was a kinesiology major and had the view that size and mass come from time, so regardless what you're doing you'll be losing weight. If you want more information or more specifics let me know. A lot of my workouts have been shaped by cross\-fit with 5\-3\-1 and [sealfit.com](https://sealfit.com) but that site no longer gives out free WODs like it did when I was using it.",2018-06-05 13:23:22

Ive always had a bad case of emotional instability during my pms (usually anger and temper tantrums) before the bpd relationship. Now there's no anger.. Just intensified missing and sadness. It helps to use an app to track my cycles and know it's just pms. ",2018-06-05 13:35:53

1043,"I went to a baby shower on Sunday for a good college friend and yesterday she was admitted to L&D!  It's early - she's about 35w4, due July 6th, but her blood pressure was high and protein in her urine, so they admitted her for preeclampsia and said she won't leave without her baby out.  So excited for her, I know she is ready to get him out, but hoping it all goes well as she's probably a little scared as well.  Baby should be ok, maybe a little time in the NICU.

I think I felt lil boy kick last night :) I've had a couple of random flutters the last week or two - felt like tiny muscle spasms, all below my belly button, slightly to the left.  Last night I felt something in the same area, but it was slightly *harder*.  Nothing like gas and seems like a weird spot for a tiny spasm. :D",2018-06-05 14:14:03
1044,"that's fine, I had every champion 4 years ago, also for new players they can stick to a select few champions instead of fluttering around a whole host of them. Another company would let you try every champion out in practice mode btw, for sure.",2018-06-05 14:26:15

1048,"Everybody likes to make these types of suicide memes, but I believe The Bee Movie jokes are truly one of a kind.

""B-Barry-kun,"" Vanessa stuttered, ""I... I have something to tell you...""

Barry felt his length begin to harden.

""What is it, Vanessa?""

She shuddered, crossing her arms in a taut pretzel, and inhaled deeply.

""I'm into bee-stiality.""

Barry couldn't repress his lust any longer; his 122-day lifespan was far too short for him not to act on his primal urges. Whipping out his engorged ""stinger,"" the honeybee began to drool over Vanessa's form, now bee-ing stripped of its pesky clothing by her own free will. He viciously enters her shitter; her nipples begin to become stiff.

""Oh, Ken!""

A pause: absolute silence rang throughout the room.

""What the fuck did you just say, bee-tch?""

""B-B-Barry... I didn't mean it, I swear!""

...But there was no stopping him now. Dripping with lust and pre-cum, Barry squirms and wiggles into Vanessa's bee-hind like an insect to a flower. Clenching her body from the pain, Vanessa hears a sharp, wincing snap permeate throughout the air. Turning around in horror, Vanessa realized what she had done. Bug-goop dripped from her cavernous crapper.

Barry was still.

""I... I... I'm sorry! I didn't mean to,"" a sniff, ""Why, Barry, why? Why? I loved you... you were the only one who cared for me... the only one who didn't drink and beat and hurt me... Barry... Barry...""

She sobs and sobs over Barry's lifeless corpse. His head remained intact, but his entire lower section had been completely bee-headed.

Suddenly, a flash of light; wings fluttered softly. The body began to move once more.

Lifting his head up high, what could be blood or semen or tears in his eyes, Barry coughs and gasps into the air...

""How's that for pollination?""

And he remained still once more.",2018-06-05 14:55:42
1049,"Sounds like you're new here.  Most people go through this after their first bull run and subsequent crash.  Let me tell you what will likely happen.

The price will continue to recover slowly.  $700, 800, 900, retrace back to 750, back up to 1000+.  Eventually you'll reach the point where you've broken even on your investment, maybe even made a small profit, and you'll take your bags and leave.

The price will continue to slowly rise though, and you'll regret selling.  It'll go on another bull run, and you'll be slapping yourself the entire time.  The price will recover a bit, and you'll jump back in, probably at a slightly higher price than you sold at.  Then it'll go on another big bull run, crash again, but this time you'll be dead inside and won't care.  You'll just sit patiently and wait for things to even out again while the technology and adoption continue to improve.

Most of us have gone through it before.  A TON of people said exactly what you're saying last summer after the drop from 420 to 130, followed by 3 months of fluttering around 250-300.

If you want to sell it all and leave, then go right ahead, but the missed opportunities while you sit in FIAT are 10x harder to deal with than price fluctuations while you're in IMO.",2018-06-05 15:00:51

Hint 2: The next day, my friends, this guy, and I went to get drunk. I asked to see his phone (latest iPhone) and then asked to see photos of his recent trip to see the quality of the photos. I stumbled upon a photo of him shirtless in swim trunks. I sent this photo to myself accidentally TWICE cuz I was drunk and thought I was sending the photo to my friend. The guy saw and laughed. 

Hint 3: later we go out to a bar where Im placing my hands on him a lot and snag every opportunity to talk to him alone. Im doing the whole fluttering eyelashes and laughing at everything he says and smiling a lot at him. 

Hint 4: I leave for the bathroom. Apparently, my friend comes over to the guy. Asked him if he wanted to smash me. He said yeah! My friend, being the great wing woman that she is, said ok she does too. And leaves. ",2018-06-05 15:49:06

Whenever Richard Cory went down town,

We people on the pavement looked at him:

He was a gentleman from sole to crown,

Clean favored, and imperially slim.


And he was always quietly arrayed,

And he was always human when he talked;

But still he fluttered pulses when he said,

""Good-morning,"" and he glittered when he walked.


And he was richyes, richer than a king

And admirably schooled in every grace:

In fine, we thought that he was everything

To make us wish that we were in his place.


So on we worked, and waited for the light,

And went without the meat, and cursed the bread;

And Richard Cory, one calm summer night,

Went home and put a bullet through his head.

1057,"Just get in the habit of a checklist. Its pattern recognition, and I like to ignore the odd random beat until last. 

First: is it a flat line? Check the leads. Does it look like static? Shock it. 

1. Overall regular or irregular? If its regular its not a-fib. 

2. Rate (fast or slow): box method if regular, R waves in a 6-10 second strip if not. 

3. Is there a P for every QRS? (A fib has no Ps just a squiggly baseline, Aflutter has P like things, supraventricular tach the P is generally hidden, Vtach doesnt really have one) this also helps you look for heart blocks. 

5. If fast, is the QRS wide or narrow?

6. Ischemia. ST or T wave changes. Bonus points for MI criteria if they have an old BBB. 

7. Everything else: that random beat (pac or pvc), bundle branches blocks, T waves that suggest low or high K+, right heart strain patterns, electrical alterans, pacer spikes. Weird stuff like Wpw (delta waves), J waves, Wall aneurysms, familial diseases, etc.

As with almost everything in CFS this is mostly hypothetical but if you dont have normal energy everything is working harder, increasing your heart rate. Bedrest can also cause the heart fluttering as your body gets used to the change in posture.

It also sounds like you are having some anxiety. Again, totally normal and okay. You can and should get help with all of these issues but I get that it can be hard. With anxiety the main thing I find helpful is if you are anxious about a What if problem, thats just your brain being mean to you. Deep breathing is cliche but it works. ",2018-06-05 17:43:29

1067,"First of all your friend is an idiot. Ruck running is how people get hurt and cause themselves long term injury. Do not do that. 

Focus on your ability to run between 2-5 miles at a time, at a decent pace. The Army Physical Fitness Test standards can be found online. Base your 2 mile running speed around maxing that test. Your 5 mile run should be under 40 minutes. 

You can train for this by straight up running, or by doing interval sprint work to train your cardio. People love 30/60s, Im a fan of 400/800 meter repeats. Mix in longer runs to train your endurance. 

Also focus on your ability to do push-ups, sit-ups, pull-ups, dips, air squats, flutter kicks, pretty much any sort of body weight calisthenics. You will be tested on push-ups and sit-ups, but the rest of those exercises are frequently featured in our PT sessions. 

You can also start lifting. Tool around /r/fitness or bodybuilding.com for their starter plans and determine what you need to work on. Go from there. 

If you want to train your body to prepare for rucking then work on your squat, deadlift, back, and core when you go to the gym. Ruck running is absolutely terrible for you and your knees (trust me, I have had knee surgery) and you shouldnt be doing it unless youre under a time hack. ",2018-06-05 18:32:31

1069,"The black sinister smoke circled around me as I elevated from my hellish hideaway. Darkness was a friend of mine and I greeted it with a toothy snarl. Energy popped and gargled around me as sparks of rouge and chartreuse spiraled into the den of my summoning. 

""Oh dear!"" I heard a lady shriek. 

I prepared my throat for my big entrance to frighten those who summoned me with their wishes of grandeur. 

""Oh dear."" I heard the lady much calmer this time. ""This isn't quite right.""

Seconds later a sunspotted old hand reach forward and pulled me from my summoning circle. Fully immersed in new light, I looked around at my new abode only to see an senile old lady, grey hairs fluttering out of her bun, eyes squinted and crusty from poor care, and cracked lips that smack together constantly to re\-hydrate them.

""Oh dear,"" the old lady said dragging me around by my belled\-sleeves. ""Have you seen my cat, young man?""

""Cat?"" I repeated instantly.

""Yes, my poor dear Luc has gone missing. Can you help me find him?""

I dragged my nails across my face after hearing such a ridiculous request.

""Listen lady, I am Arawn, God of the Underworld. I don't waste time looking for some stupid cat!"" I whacked the old lady away from my hand and heard her thud against the wall as I walked back to the summoning circle.

""STOP!"" The old lady yelled freezing me in my tracks.

The summoning spell allowed the user complete word power over me if said with enough conviction, but rarely did these human has enough conviction or were smart enough to figure that out. 

I turned my face as well as I could to see the lady standing behind me. 

""You killed a human to find your cat?!""

The old lady came into view and smack her hand against the air. 

""That wasn't a human, it was only the paper boy.""

I cleared my throat. ""So you want help finding your cat?""

""Yes dear. Luc, he's a mischievous black cat. He always comes back home, but I can't seem to find him.""

I laughed to myself. ""Very well. We will find you cat, Luc and we will part ways. Deal?""

I stuck out my hand waiting for her to shake it. The skin hung off the bones like drying laundry. Muscle and flesh was decayed leaving behind the grey casing that was my body suit. 

The lady touched my hand without delay. The deal was set.

""Oh dear! We must get you something to eat first. You're basically skin and bones."" She began to pull me away from her basement up the stairs to a well light kitchen area. 

""That's because I am skin and bones. Lets go find you cat."" I tried to pull her the other way.

""I said sit!""

I then found myself shoving lasagna down my throat as she poured my another glass of milk. This wasn't so bad. I guess I could stay like this for a bit. ",2018-06-05 18:38:56

1074,"Ill call him Buck and heres the atrocities of Buck that made Sergeant Pickleindabutt life a very miserable one at times.

SPC Buck came to us overweight, very overweight. When doing flutter kicks, he told our 1SG he didnt know how to do them because they never did them in the 173rd. Buck also got a Article 15 because he told a new private to lie for him concerning the fact he didnt do the 8th lap on a 2 mile PT test, the Private told me this. Buck also sold his IBA plates because he couldnt afford the payments on his Alien computer. We found this out because we were doing a gear layout 12 hours prior to deploying very rapidly on GRF. How did he go so far without us knowing this? Because he was borrowing his roommates for over six month who also needed them now to deploy too. On that deployment, Buck was caught stealing a PLs NVGs because he lost his swing arm. Few days later, Buck forgot to put a humvee in thus resulting it rolling down a hill and crashing into another one. He also forgot to take off his seat belt completely while this was happening causing him to be dragged by this feral and out of control humvee. This deployment, after Bucks many events, he was only allowed to sweep dirt due to his inability to not fuck everything up. He was the only person in the battalion to receive a COA instead of an AAM, which everyone else received **BUT** him. 

Buck also became a jump refusal after this deployment and only decided to continue when he realized his wings could be taken. Do you realize how high up the fucking chain it goes when someone decides to be a jump refusal? Yes, there I was in front of the BDE CSM with my pride and joy, Buck. Prior to that, Buck slapped himself in the face Ric Flair style in the Commanders office because he was swatting a bug. Due to the sheer initial force of his retard hand when smacking this nonexistent bug, he feinted while at the position of attention and on the way down, hit his giant noggin on the fucking desk, knocking himself clean the fuck out. I really didnt know at this point if I was living in real life.

Buck one time got lost while taking a shit in the field. I know he was lost because I was standing on top of my humvee watching his dipshit self wander around back and forth looking for the gun truck. Here he was, looking confused as fuck, holding shitter paper and his M4. I just watched for a minute, he never travelled a over 50 meters away. Daylight. Multiple running humvees. People were talking because we were in admin. He lost us.

So many more stories. The time where he didnt want to go through the gate because the hospital put something radiological in him and he thought it would set off base alarms. The time we checked his room and you would have thought it was a To Go plate museum in there. 

Oh! He got me though with the last fuk u Sgt! We deployed to Afghanistan and he didnt come due to reclass orders. I came back to some new joes. I gave them my usual spill of If theres any issues, lets bring them in the open now. One told me he had financial issues already. He basically went to a Rent-A-Center and financed **EVERYTHING.** He told me he showed up to the unit and an experienced guy had all this cool shit in his room and asked the new guy if he wanted cool shit too. Drove him to the Rent-A-Center that day and got him into the fucking dumb privateist deal ever. Before he even said a name, I muttered it...

And in fact, I think I can actually help with that problem! 

Essentially, just by reading a few tips below, those of you non-swimming Redditors can learn to swim at a most basic-survival level, without having to set foot in a pool: 

--------------------------------

FIRSTLY: 

Always keep in mind that if your lungs are filled with air, you can't sink! 

This comes as a huge revelation to many non-swimmers. 

Unless, of course, you've got some kind of weight or brick or cement block tied to you by some guy named ""Vinny"" because you failed to pay your gambling debts (in which case you're a goner!)... 

But yes, if you suddenly find yourself stranded in deep water, or a tidal flowing water... all you have to do is: 

--------------------------------

A) Don't panic. 

B) Do the doggy paddle and take a nice deep breath. 

C) Next, tuck your knees into your stomach, and wrap your arms around your knees and hold them, so that you roll yourself up into a  nice ball shape. 

Picture yourself as a nice tight ball. 

--------------------------------

D) At that point you'll simply automagically find yourself floating nicely and blissfully in the water, with your face just below the water surface, looking downward. You'll bob up and down gently with each wave. 

--------------------------------

E) After a few moments, you'll want to take a new breath of fresh air. 

So... simply lift your face back out of the water and exhale, while doing a slow doggy paddle motion, and breath in deeply a couple of times... 

--------------------------------

F) Then once again, hold your breath, and repeat: rolling back up into a nice floating ball again, with your knees tucked into your stomach. 

--------------------------------

So yes... the next time you're in a swimming pool or lake, try this floating-ball survival technique. 

I think you'll be pretty amazed that you can just float like that with barely any effort! 

Getting good at floating like that will give you a HUGE burst of confidence, if you should ever find yourself in deep water. 

--------------------------------

NEXT... 

Once you've mastered the floating ball technique... which will probably only take a couple of hours to master--and some people even master it after 5 minutes!--you will then next want to learn some kind of ""stroke"" motion.

You'll need to learn a stroke motion, in order to swim slowly towards 
a land destination. 

--------------------------------

For newbies, probably an easy stroke motion to learn is the backstroke. 

So... after you've calmed yourself down, and stabilized your situation by floating as a nice ball... 

You can then turn around slowly on your back, and just gently flutter your legs in a slow kicking motion. 

While doing that, left your right arm towards the sky... and then keep your arm nice and straight but stretch towards the sky... and then keep stretching as if you were reaching for something behind you until you feel your arm splash back down in the water, behind your head. 

Once your arm splashes in the water, pull your towards the side of your body, and keep your hands cupped, as if your cupping and pulling on water. 

Once that arm reaches the side of your body, do the stretch with your arm... and keep alternating. 

Just do this back stroke nice and SLOW... no rush... 

keep gently fluttering your legs and feet as you do the arm stretch motions... 

Again... take it slow... no rush... 

--------------------------------

An ALTERNATIVE to the back stroke locomotion... 

You can always try the frog paddle... 

To frog paddle, just slice both arms and hands into the water in front of you. 

Keep your fingers straight like they are knife... slicing forward. 

Once your two arms have sliced forward, CHANGE the shape of your hands, so they are like cups, and PULL the water in a circular arc, as both arms move in a circular motion, until they hit the side of your body. 

When they hit the side of your body, change your hand into a knife shape again... and SLICE forward into the water like a knife, then change back to cupped hands, and PULL back on the water in a circular arc again... 

This will give you forward locomotion, as you gently swim towards a destination...

--------------------------------

IN SHORT: 

If you can't do the back-stroke motion I described above...

And you can't do the frog-stroke motion I described above... 

Then ALL you have to do is float like a ball! 

As long as you float as a nice relaxed bobbing ball, you'll survive until help comes, or you can figure something out and experiment with trying to locomote yourself towards land. 

At any rate, floating as a ball will dramatically increase your survival time.

-Bring a spare windbreaker (1am-4am can get chilly) and extra socks in case you get dunked. Put them in a dry sack so they dont get wet. 
-Dont bring too much food. Youll be hydrating more than you eat. 3-4 energy gels and Nuun tablets will suffice. Put them in your inside top zippered compartment in a zip lock for easy grab.
-Bring 1-2 tabs of Tylenol/aspirin.

1090,"> Are you high? The peak of growth was still during Dictatorship era and it started going downhill when he was being rebelled against and ousted. 

holy sh*t. you entire mindset is backwards. Economy didn't go downhill because he was being ousted, he was ousted because economy went down! Revelations don't happen because economies are doing well.

> even after he was gone, GDP went up 100% and then came crashing down the next year. 

Are you referring to GDP going from 1.7 to 2.8 as 100% increase? wtf is wrong with you? It's fluttering at the bottom, going from nothing to nothing.

>  Pakistan was more steady during dictatorship(apart from when he was obviously being ousted) 

The performance you are bragging about happened when US lifted sanctions against Pakistan because Musharraf agreed to be America's b*tch in ""war on terror"".

Here is a quick history lesson:
The economy went to shit after NS govt conducted nuclear tests (US and other continues placed sanctions), US removed sanctions (and gave aid) after 9/11 and the economy bounced back. It went back to shit after Musharraf tried to play off US and Taliban at the same time. Daily drone attacks on one end and suicide attacks on the other. At the same time, his short term thinking left little investment for the future. 

^ that is what forced people to take to the streets and get him kicked out. People don't line up to be shot by their own army because of 7% GDP grown.

But only after a few hours I felt amazing but also kind of an odd feeling. my migraine was completely gone. It was a migraine that Ive had every day for a while. But then as I was coming off of it throughout the night I started feeling really weird and messed up and had really bad stomach pains. 

 My Neurologist told me that Imitrex works by giving you a lot of relief really fast. then I tried taking other triptans that are more steady in relief instead of just shooting me upwards for a few hours then crashing down to hell again.

""Good-morning,"" and he glittered when he walked.


And he was richyes, richer than a king

And admirably schooled in every grace:

In fine, we thought that he was everything

To make us wish that we were in his place.


So on we worked, and waited for the light,

And went without the meat, and cursed the bread;

And Richard Cory, one calm summer night,

Went home and put a bullet through his head.

1111,"Most of what will follow I do in order to pay homage to a work of art found and what must have been painfully lost. It is intended as a means of respectfully treating this piece of art as what it is. An earnest and most likely private expression of thought and emotion.  



I'll make my case based on the relative ease of which the artist could project themselves onto her (for fairness possibly his) creation and on the ""effectiveness"" of that potential fantasy. (yes i have too much time) 




First a look at the girls art:

- Aside from the previously mentioned gradient dress she is also wearing what appear to be ballerina slippers (an unlikely choice for a young boy's fantasy)

- Her hair is shown in full and is particularly defining, appearing to have taking up a considerable percentage of drawing time. 

- She's wearing a wonderfully drawn whimsical dress 

- Her face is remarkably well drawn and humanlike. 

- Horns, red irises


Compared now to the boy:

- He unlike her is drawn rather simply in regular clothes and roughly, almost haphazardly

- unlike the girl his appearance is based off of another character (I personally think the inspiration is clear) Jack Skellington 

- Jack is rather popular with many tween and teen girls

- Noseless rounded head, big eyes, pale skin. Almost alien in appearance but non-threatening. 

- Horns, black sclera (perhaps another anime reference), blue irises



Overall the girl appears much more human being based off of real world inspiration rather than another fictional character. Despite them both possessing horns (which I believe may be an additional reference to the anime Darling in the franxxx) and strange eyes her eyes remain much closer to normal scale, and her horns smaller much more diminutive. 



Her mouth and nose are both present and in somewhat human proportions. Of course why would any anxious youth draw themselves, with all of their overflowing body image issues, in monstrous proportions? That would be self-flagellation. No this piece (especially the girl) was crafted with passion. Otherwise it would be an unpleasant fantasy experience. 



Of course if she did not look human it would be difficult to immerse herself into her role with ease the girl in the image is a metaphor for her inner feeling of pain and desire to belong. 



Next taking a look at the narrative (of equal art and importance, or else it would not be on the same page) normally a child around this age would, in fantasy, insert themselves into the persecuted role in order to play out the anxiety that they feel in a controlled and safe setting. 


That being said what narrative do we have and what roles can we find to fill? The girl, the boy, her father? The parallels to Adventure Time's Flame Princess and her own father are of course clear, but art imitates life and perhaps this young artist recognized these parallels between her own life and Adventure Time and subsequently her art. 



The girl is described in almost every line and takes a much more active role in the text, in contrast to the boy who is a passive party to the entire thing. Notice that his affections for her is not ONCE quantified, perhaps once when they both are described as ""lovers"". 

- ""SHE lives in the underworld"" , where does he live? In the mortal world? Perhaps but we aren't told. 

- ""so (SHE) is used to pain"", again no directly reference to the boy

- ""SHE sees him,"" again he is a passive actor in this play 

- ""and HE steals HER heart right away, "", but did he do anything? No. There was no interaction no interplay she saw him and instantly fell in love. 

- ""HER father tries to kill him"", the father lf course is the villain, but once again something is simply happening to the boy, no agency almost no participation.

- ""but SHE AND him run away"", once again she is the main subject running away and he is joining along. He is no hamlet simply a side character. He was almost killed but she was the one who ran away with him. 

- ""it's like whenever""

- ""SHES with him"" subject, object

- ""SHE feels SHES lighting up with hope"" 

- ""They have eachother, SHE loves no other"", notice it isn't stated how he feels.



He doesn't have agency in this relationship. Does he love another? Of course not he's not the subject and he does not act, but is only acted upon because this is her fantasy. 


Looking at the art again we see the boy is anything but sad or anxious, and to the contrary he seems very the definition of security and calm as a butterfly, a symbol of metamorphosis and rebirth, lands on his hand and perhaps this suggests the him as a symbol of puberty, metamorphosis, the desire of independence and the childish longing of adulthood. 



All of this led me to believe that it was created by a young girl, placing herself in the persecuted role of girl born in the underworld, perhaps stemming from real life family issues (which she wishes to escape), or school pressures, now free and living in a place she feels she doesn't belong, but validated by a boy who does belong and because of her unconditional love, loves and accepts her for who she is.



The reverse story (male artist and writer) is an all around less engaging fantasy or narrative. The boy character starts at one place (growing up in peace) and ends in that same position. There's no power fantasy there, no childhood drama, no angst, no heart break and absolutely no agency. Without any of these things what would motivate the creation of this work of art?




In the same way many boys chase after the princess to ""aquire"" self-worth our artist longs to ""secure"" her prince and therefore secure her belonging in the world.



The girl is drawn demure turned partly away from us, her left slippered foot en pointe, her position off center of stage, her face wearing an expression of unease, but her costume more beautiful and elaborate than the rest of the set combined. 



Why is SHE pushed to the edges of the frame? Surely she belongs in center stage? The question is posed to us in the audience but soon, with aid of the boy and a flutter of new found confidence she will fly out into view like the butterfly she is claiming her spot light. 



A harmless and beautiful childhood play that speaks as clearly to me as if it were my own past, and of all our past costumes we grew too big for. ",2018-06-06 00:42:07

1113,"Honestly, if I wouldn't have taken a pregnancy test on a hunch, I wouldn't have had the slightest clue that I was pregnant. I'm 26 weeks now. I've had irregular periods for about 4 years (sometimes months with no period), I'm a little chunky (215lbs) and my weight fluctuates regularly (\+/\- 10lbs). I don't want to come across as a brag\-er haha, but I've had no nausea/vomiting, only gained 10lbs thus far, and have had almost none of the classic pregnancy symptoms. I also have an anterior placenta, so I only really started feeling baby move about 6 weeks ago. I do think I would have figured it out by 20 weeks, though. I'm all belly and I feel like I'm be assaulted by my insides (missing when the movement was more fluttery and less kicky/punchy). 

I can see how some people might not figure it out. I had an acquaintance who didn't know she was pregnant until 35 weeks or so. She was a large, tall woman.. close to 300lbs and almost 6ft tall. I think she found out when she was going for an ultrasound to get her kidneys or gallbladder checked for stones, something like that. She said her periods were regular and didn't feel a thing.

1116,"I will try my best to help. Like others have said the deck doesn't have anything to build on for legacy. Duskwatch Recruiter sees play in some modern humans or good creature decks. He is decent in creature heavy decks and is played in Commander. Kozilek's Return does see some play in legacy but mostly as a sideboard card. 

If you play just with friends, casual doesn't have to mean weak, just that it doesn't conform to a format. Cards like Sol Ring or other inexpensive cards on the legacy banned list can pump up any casual deck easily. If you want to stick with legacy format you can try using proxies of cards until you can build out the real thing or just so you can play and participate. 

The closest legacy deck that plays like this one is probably Infect, although it isn't as competitive as it used to be its still a very powerful deck. So you could potentially start by swapping out your instants with cards like Vines of Vastwood,  Become Immense,  Blossoming Defense and Berserk. Non legacy options include Groundswell,  Might of Old Krosa, and  Mutagenic Growth. 

Then start to cut your creatures and swap them with green infect creatures, eventually cutting red from the deck altogether. If you can go mono green for a bit but your goal is to get to green and blue. For mono green look at pauper infect builds, for blue/green you can start standard and work your way to legacy. Infect is the only deck that is mostly the same despite being in many formats.  Glistener Elf and  Viridian Corrupter should be the 1st adds, if you need cheap other creatures you can also use Ichorclaw, Blight Mamba, Rot Wolf, and Llanowar Augur. Once you have some infect creatures in add Invigorate.  Add  Noble Hierarch when you are almost ready to move into blue. 

Next start on your land get Pendelhaven first, then the infect lands Inkmoth Nexus. You can add Crop Rotation or two in at this time. Gitaxian Probe can also be added at any time since you will rarely pay to cast it anyway.  Once you are ready to splash blue get the fetchlands and then your modern (Breeding Pool) or legacy (Tropical Island) Dual lands. 

With blue get  Blighted Agent, Brainstorm, spell pierce, ponder and Daze, Gitaxian Probe, flutterstorm, Force of Will and sometimes stifle. 

If you want a semi legacy playable werewolf build, there was a werewolf stompy deck for a bit but it is overshadowed by current red stompy builds. Like said before, you want to slow your opponent down with blood moon and trinisphere to get your creatures to transform and to make them suck less.

I believe that a knuckleball with NO rotation at all will usually be a big fat meatball.  We can see on this pitch, for example, that the ball rotates about one-half of a rotation, and I'm pretty certain that knuckleballs that don't rotate at all tend not to flutter at all.

However I don't know if the pitcher can even *attempt* to control this, or if he is simply doing his best to throw the ball without ANY rotation, and when he accomplishes that the ball will tend to rotate slightly on its own, due to the same forces and changes in air pressure which also cause it to ""flutter.""",2018-06-06 05:07:21

Charlie's only memories from a young age were that of the orphanage. Since it was the wrong side of town, it was pretty common not to grow up with a father, or any parent for that matter. At that moment, feeling that small message made Charlie's heart flutter. Maybe it was his dad, or his aunt, or his--

""This is going to be a good session"" thought the unidentifiable voice. It sounded like a man though, so maybe his brother, dad, uncle, or even granddad? Charlie couldn't wait to find out.

And boy did he. Turns out that the man, who was his brother, had been looking at porn at that fateful moment. This wasn't just any regular old porn, this was some BDSM Tenticle very VERY inappropriate (and frankly downright illegal) stuff. This didn't turn out so good for young Charlie at the orphanage. Charlie soon went from being the most active and friendly kid to a very paranoid and traumatized individual.

1140,"Okay so this is kind of long, but for a while I had a ghost attached to me. His name was Gregory Sarles and his body was found in the creek by my house at the time (years before we moved in). It started the very first night. I was on my fouton on the floor, watching Beerfest, trying to sleep. I see a hand fluttering under the love seat that was in there when we moved in as well as a shift in the air and i freak out a little, turn the t.v up and ignore it until the sun comes up. Okay so next day, I'm chilling in bed again and my window opens for no reason. I thought someone was breaking in but it always happened at like 2 or 3a.m  e v e r y night. After a few weeks of seeing shadows, hearing voices and a bunch of other creepy shit, my sister and I decide to search for the ghosts identity to try and give him closure. We look through multitudes of obits and pictures and articles, but when I saw his face, man. I got goosebumps, my eyes started watering and my head started tingling as well as an overwhelming feeling of HIM. He was shot and killed and, from what he told me, left to drown half dead. I knew we'd found him. So I tried to figure him out for a while bc he was always messing with me by distorting my music, making my bath water cold, and smearing my art. I learned that he doesn't like other people knowing about him and that he was unhappy with how he died and that he saw me as a sister almost. After we moved to a new place with a pond in the backyard, he laid off for a while. But right around Christmas, he started up again. He closed the chimney plume while we had a fire going to get me to go on the back porch, I almost died from smoke inhalation. He kept asking me to swim with him, begging me to. Then we found out my dad had cancer so I moved back in with my parents. He fucked with me harder then. He'd pick up shit and drop it randomly, make stuff disappear, rearrange shit, always say my name. Around this time, I met my now-fiance, E. He lived in Charlotte, three blocks from where Greg's car was found after he died. The first time I went up there, I could tell Greg wanted to stay, but there was something evil following me at that time and he had become a very protective spirit, so he stayed with me for a while longer. Every time I went to Charlotte, our connection would get weaker until one day, I didn't feel him at all anymore. I hope his soul found peace, I miss him. ",2018-06-06 06:14:36

1154,"> I'll follow the instructions of the hypnotist, but I don't get a strong sense of it being 'involuntary'.

Probably you will never have the feeling of doing something involuntary. Our brain doesn't like that.

And it isn't involuntary. You're doing the actions. Either with you conscious mind or with your subconscious mind. But in both cases voluntary. Hypnosis isn't a strange magical power that makes you do things. A hypnotist only gives you suggestions. You brain can translate these suggestions into feelings, emotions and actions.

So you question is basically: ""Do I translate the suggestions subconsciously into actions or do I play along consciously"" But even that is a question which is incredible hard to answer to youself. I will give you an example:

When we drive a car for the first time we will do everything consciously. We think about the steering, we think about operating the clutch, the brakes and the gas. We think about shifting the gears. This results in a terrible driving, because thinking is slow and this are way too much things to think about. So we stall the motor, we do stupid things, because we're concentrating on others things, we choose wrong gears etc. But after a while we learn to operate all this things subconsciously. We don't think about all this stuff anymore and all this things become easy. Now imagine following:

You sit with your friend in his car. He is driving. You're talking. Then you see your friend pressing the clutch, shifting from the 3rd in the 4th gear an releasing the clutch. All this while talking to you. Then you ask him why he shifted the gears. And he will answer something like ""Yeah dude, the revs got to high, I had to shift"" or at least anything like that. But it will sound like he made the active descision to shift the gears. But he is lying without knowing it. The truth is that he recieved a trigger (just like a trigger word in hypnosis) like the high pitched sound of the motor, or the sensation of speed or something like that. And the trigger made him shift gears subconsciously. His conscious mind had nothing to do with it. His arm and leg movement just was an automated response to a trigger. Just like hypnosis. But yet his brain made him believe that this was an active decision.

Do you get what I mean?

Do you do hypnosis with audio files or with other persons? If you do it face to face with a hypnotist then just ask him. There are clear signs if a person is in a actual trance or just playing along. Eye fluttering, ideomotoric movement etc. Also there are tests that hypnotist can do with their hypnotees to check how deep they are: Arm drop test, arm catalepsy test, movability of the head/neck. The results of these test can tell a hypnotist if the hypnotee is not in a trance, if he is in a trance or if he is playing along.

Anyway: Just enjoy it! If you like it and then keep doing it. And don't think to much about how ""involuntary"" or deep you are. Thinking about stuff while doing hypnosis isn't helpful at all. Just let go and enjoy.",2018-06-06 09:26:47

1158,"He wanders around aimlessly before he finds even one person who will talk to him. Some ratty beggar on the street turns out to be nice enough to explain where he is.

""You're in the afterlife!"" he tells the man, ""But you must have been a real shithead when you were alive, because this is the fourth ring, and only the worst people come here.""

All of a sudden, a siren goes off, one of those air-raid things. The man is terrified but the beggar gets up calmly and leads him to a big, dilapidated warehouse where thousands of other similarly unkempt souls are gathering. When the man asks why they're all here, the beggar points to a line of folding tables against the wall. Each table has some moldy bread, cups of dingy water, and some bowls of broth so thin they could have just run out of cups. Only then does the man realize how hungry he is. A guard in heavy body armor blows a whistle and all the people arrange themselves into three lines.

The beggar is helpful enough to explain them for the man. ""That one's the bread line, that's the broth line, and that's the water line. All the food here is free, but if you want to get out of this maggot hole, you've got to work, because the gate guards into the third ring ask five hundred dollars to get through. I've heard the food is better there.""

So the man gets his food. It's abominable, and right then and there, he vows to make five hundred dollars and get into the third ring. Unfortunately for him, very few people need work in the afterlife, especially when all of them are saving up to emigrate. Even still, after ten years of hard work, eating the moldy bread and indistinguishable soup and water, he finally saves up enough money. The guards let him through and he finds himself in the third ring. It's nothing too fancy, if anything, it's a bit below average for a real city, but to his eyes it is paradise. All the guards look much friendlier, and the houses and buildings, while not spacious or lavish, are at least up to code. And to his surprise, he runs right into a familiar former beggar as he crosses the street.

""What are the odds?"" they both ask and they get to conversing. The beggar, it turns out, only managed to make it in himself a few months back. Their conversation is interrupted, however, by what sounds like a school bell. When the man seems confused, the beggar leads him to what looks like a giant gymnasium. Here, people are gathering once again, and the man begins to understand. On a line of folding tables against one wall are stacks of hot dogs, big bowls of salad, and solo cups full of fresh lemonade. A cop shouts for everyone's attention and directs them all to stand in three lines. The beggar smiles at the man's wonder and points to each line in turn. ""That's the hot dog line, that's the salad line, and that's the lemonade line."" The man gets in each line in turn and gets himself his lunch.

While he's eating, basking in joy at not being stuck with old bread and water, the beggar encourages him, ""The best part is, halfway through the year, they switch from hot dogs, salad, and lemonade to chicken, chili, and hot chocolate. You can never get tired of it!""

Sadly, this proved not to be true. After only a few days, the man did again get tired of the same meal every day. But he knew firsthand that he could change his lot, so one day he went up to the wall of the second circle. This time the guards were asking for ten thousand dollars. Well, the man didn't like it, but he figured he had his whole afterlife ahead of him now that he was out of the fourth circle, and he could certainly take some time to save up. After ten years of hard work, it wasn't too difficult for him to keep up the work ethic, and only twenty years later, he went back to the guards of the second ring with the money in hand. He went through the gate and found himself in a glittering, clean city full of glass and steel.

And wouldn't you know it, but there, standing across the street was the same beggar, only now he was wearing a well-fitted suit. The man greeted the beggar as an old friend and they started talking again. Once again, their conversation was interrupted, only this time it was by beautiful church bells. ""Come,"" the beggar told him, ""I'll take you to the evening meal."" So the man followed and they entered a glamorous ballroom filled with beautiful attendees. Even the cops here looked good, dressed in suits and sunglasses like bodyguards. And sure enough, piled onto platters on huge mahogany tables against the far wall were plates of steak, bowls of the most delicious seafood soups, and glasses of champagne. One of the bodyguards cleared his throat loudly and politely requested that the attendees line up. Three lines were formed and the beggar pointed each line out in turn. ""That's the steak line, that's the soup line, and that's the champagne line,"" and then he added, ""and apparently here, they change the meals FOUR times a year!""

The man rejoiced, ate, and was happy, and for once felt that nothing was lacking. Four changes a year was enough for him. But one day, out of curiosity, he went up to the bodyguards that guarded the gate into the first and final ring of the afterlife and found they were asking for a million dollars to pass. Well the man was a bit disturbed by this, after all, the second ring seemed perfect to him. ""What is it,"" he thought, ""that could possibly be more wonderful than what I have here?"" That question haunted him for weeks until he came to a conclusion. He was used to working hard and he had all of eternity to save up, so he wanted, just once to see what he could possibly be missing in the first ring.

Fifty years later, he returned to the guards with a million dollars. When he stepped into the first ring he fell to his knees. The architecture was glorious and inhuman, and the bodyguard had turned into shining angels. To his surprise, someone helped him up off the street and when he looked, he realized he recognized who it was--it was the beggar he met in the fourth ring, adorned in a golden robe and glowing, and when he looked down at himself he realized he looked much the same.

The beggar laughed jovially. ""I got here only three years ago myself, but somehow I knew you would be right here behind me. I've come back to this gate every day waiting for you to make it in!"" Suddenly, the air was filled with the sound of angelic choirs and the beggar led the man off to a gigantic palace made of crystal and cloud. The room was filled with radiant citizens of the first circle and angels prepared everything. Sure enough, there was a line of massive altars against one wall, spilling over with glistening golden dragon meat, a pudding refined from clouds and dew and silk, and an ice cold tub of ambrosia and nectar ladled out individually into blindingly beautiful crystalline chalices. An angel fluttered from the ceiling and bowed silently to the assembled mass, who bowed respectfully back and then broke themselves into their lines on their own.

Smiling at the tradition, the beggar pointed to the first line. ""That's the line for the dragon meat,"" he said before turning to the next line, ""and that's the line for angeldust stew,"" then he paused, confused.

""What is it?"" the man asked his old friend.

The beggar replied, ""There appears to be no punchline.""",2018-06-06 10:41:43
1159,"I didn't do anything. At that point, I was already down to two meals per day, sometimes one and a half.

I couldn't exercise because I was in a lot of pain and I was always so tired, just totally exhausted. 

By the time I reached college, I was down to one meal, some granola, and a bunch of water. I would get so weak that I had heart fluttering, but the only thing that helped me lose weight was Adderall.

I eventually had to stop the Adderall due to kidney pain, and now I can't get the weight off at all.

Flutter wouldn't affect percussion so much. Not sure about bass.

> Edge channels are more prone to flutter than the center ones (so 1,8,9,16 or 1,12,13,24).

Thit I'm not too sure about. These effects are related to variations in tape speed, something which will affect all tracks on a tape equally.

What makes more sense when looking at tape is approaching it from the perspective of track blead. Loud tracks with lots of highs should ideally not neighbor unrelated soft tracks with no highs. From there it would make sense to go Drums -> Guitars -> Bass -> Vocals.

The order comes from mixing down to tape. Go read the old timers mixing with 4 channels (or fewer) to tape. They'd mix the drums together and then move them over to the ""mix"" side of the tape and then add another instrument or vocal etc and move it to the mix side and on and on..

The order doesn't matter, it just follows a typical workflow. Most of the time Vocals are recorded last or at least separate. Look at the crooners for instance. You had an orchestra recording to 2-tracks with Frank or someone sitting on a chair singing into a mic.

*******

You're reading too much into things. She was probably having lunch with her bro already and invited you.

She may have decided that since you were feeling fluttery and she wasn't that it wouldn't be fair to keep seeing you.

Tinder isn't always *just* for hookups. In my demographic, most of the profiles are looking for LTRs even.

Back to the fluttery thing - awesome that you felt that, but understand that is one of those things that many people view it as ""needs to be the same for both or it should end."" Which is totally okay. But by mentioning it early - you run the risk of forcing it to reach a conclusion prematurely.",2018-06-06 14:42:41

1186,"Loved mine. I was induced so I was in labor for like 36 hours and hadnt slept much in the days beforehand. I wanted to wait until I needed it but before I was in a lot of pain. I got it like 24 hours in because I was so freaking tired and just wanted to sleep. Id been awake almost 48 hours at that point. 

Prior to epidural each contraction was like breathe, breathe, fuck fuck fuck, breathe breathe, ahhhh. They were never awful but between the pain, the frequency and the sleep deprivation I was definitely not enjoying it and I was pretty cranky and pissed off. 

Cue epidural. I have a curved spine and they ran it a few times. Never felt the needle puncture but I could feel the tube going in. It felt weird, not painful just *weird*. It took less than 3 minutes from puncture to placement even with multiple tries. It took a few minutes to get it turned up enough (you get to hit your button every 15 minutes to turn it up to the right level) but once it was up...magic. I was asleep within minutes. And got a wonderful, much needed nap for the rest of the afternoon. Woke up, talked calmly to my doctor, joked around with my husband, did vomit but it was kind of nbd. Went back to sleep. They woke me up for a check and were like, oh. Youre ready. 5 minutes later I was pushing. 

Did not feel a damn thing. They were like, you feel a contraction here and I was like, those sweet butterfly flutters? Sure. I pushed for an hour and a half. It was a hard workout but not painful *at all*. Husband and I were making jokes between contractions and the whole thing was just so freaking cool. Like, I was lucid and happy and in the middle of birthing life. It was the most awesome moment that my husband and I shared. Best experience of my life. Afterwards they handed my daughter to me and the doc let me know I might feel a pinch for stitches. Didnt feel a thing. Nor did I feel the placenta delivery. I was just entranced looking at my daughter. 

Recovery was stupid easy. Epidural wore off after an hour or so and they wheeled me to my room even though I was capable of walking. I walked home from the hospital a few days later (nyc). 

It was actually my second epidural. I also had one for an ECV (turning a breech baby). It kills me when I read about people getting elective c sections rather than trying for an ECV because they are concerned about the pain. Its a barbaric procedure and it left me bruised but with the epidural I didnt feel a damn thing despite having 4 people pressing on my stomach with every bit of their strength. They were all sweating with the effort and I was like hanging out. 

People dont tend to write about their experience when everything went exactly like it was supposed to. They share their trauma so that they can connect with others who went through the same thing. Most epidurals work, most women are crazy thankful for them. The internet is not a representative sample.

Theres no basis to assume that the girls would be of different nationalities, let alone skin colors.

Having said that, you could make them all black or all white, or all asian if you wanted to. Go nuts. Theres just no basis for it in canon.

The closest Id get to anything like diversity among the main six would be a sliding scale of tannedness.

Applejack- Most tanned from working the fields all day, probably a farmers tan though with much lighter skin under her cloths.

Rainbow Dash- Less tanned than AJ since she spends some of her time napping in the shade, but more evenly tanned since youd expect her to wear more skin revealing sports wear.

Fluttershy- Though she keeps to her cottage for the most part, she spends a lot of time outdoors with her animal friends, so shed have an average tan.

Pinkie Pie- Like Fluttershy most of her time is spent inside since she works indoors at Sugar-cube Corner, but she regularly throws large parties outside. Average tan, shading slightly paler.

Rarity- Spends all her time either selling dresses in her store or designing them in her workshop. However, she is a lady who values her appearance, and thus has an ever so slight all over tan (tan lines are a sin darling) from the tanning booth at the spa.

Starlight- Spent most of her time on spellcraft or plotting how to make everyone equal, so shes probably on the pale side. She does like flying kites as a hobby, so she probably has an ever so slight tan from engaging in that activity.

Twilight- Pale as the day she was born. Spent almost all her time in libraries, used to live in a library. Considers sorting books to be a weekend vacation. Probably burns after an hour in the sun.",2018-06-06 16:42:05

This is a very well\-knitted community of CMBYN cryers, huggers and even laughers. Welcome aboard. Pull up a lounger and enjoy yourself. Depending on where you saw the movie, home or theater, I predict you'll view it again within the next 18 hours. 

The feelings you have experienced are because Luca left it for us to put ourselves in the place of one or both Elio and Oliver. We are left to recall our own great love. To relive those first burgeoning flutters of desire, then those nights when you can't sleep, days when you can't do anything productive. When your face becomes one great big smile. Heaven help us if it becomes a ball of tears. Even that is a part of falling in love often. Neither life nor love is a bed of roses. But oh how the roses make us feel. :)  Yes, you'll post real soon that you saw it again... especially if you read some of the topics in here. Because on our first viewing we always miss something. With this movie u/jackrunit, you don't want to miss a thing. It's often very subtle, very subtle. Even the funny stuff you'll come to cherish. Mmm... I just love this film. 

So u/jackrunit, you were proper in watching the film before the book. It is what Andre Aciman recommends that we do. The movie was shot for 4 hours of film. It was edited down to the 2.14 we see. And I for one am itching for the entire 4 hours. I suppose we could always say who doesn't love the entire ""Godfather"" trilogy, or ""Jaws"", or ""Star Wars"" etc... okay you get me. Some films just scream sequel without losing the impact of the original. Nothing can contaminate CMBYN if done as her sequel. \` 

The book goes into the depths that the movie doesn't and you will find some things were switched around, some left out that you may consider important.  For me when I watched the film and was listening to Oliver and Elio on the berm. I was like, wait a minute, did I miss something? Yeah, because it was cut. When Oliver said, ""Us you mean"", I was left scratching my head. How did we get to ""Us""? Last I heard you told Elio ""We can't talk about these things"".

Because at its core, compatibility means seeing the value of a given subject through their partner's eyes.   Sometimes it happens to jive which is fabulous...or maybe it takes an adjustment.  

Your husband, for example.   

Whatever the reason, he doesn't recognize that he needs to get over his selfishness and discuss things with you to the best of his abilities...or that he needs to put some work in to developing those abilities.  He doesn't really understand that he could/will ultimately lose you because of it among other things.  

No doubt you've prompted and maybe even begged him to be more communicative and he's chosen to stay stuck in whatever inhibits him....hobbles him from even considering the value it could bring to the relationship...blinders securely in place and resolved that you don't deserve the effort.   Because *that's* what his silence speaks.  As much as these things can actually be rooted in insecurity in the end they just boil down to entitlement.  

He feels he deserves you in his life...deserves not disturb his comfort zone or to adjust his understanding of what he recognizes as a genuine need for you.  If he recognizes *needs* at all in the Maslow sense beyond food and shelter.  

If he did...even in a modest degree that would make you more compatible.  Not that you happen to jive on any particular thing.  But that he would have shown himself to be willing to see your needs, without fully sacrificing his own, and make an honest effort to meet those needs in spite of himself.

Figure out your event weight and lock down your gear ahead of time, then train above your event weight.  If your ruck is 40lbs, train with 50 or 60.  A lot of solid tips can be found [here](https://ruck.training/free-10-week-goruck-tough-training-plan-guide/), and I know the author hangs out here.

1219,"Summoning Fae, Part 5

When Fae awoke, she was naked. Her long silver eyelashes parted to reveal her own moon pale body stretched out before her in repose, legs splayed in relaxation, her soft belly refracting the morning light that filtered through the gothic windows mosaic of stained glass.

She curled up instinctively, closing her legs, and her hands went to her throat. There was the collar, sealed to her like an armored second skin. She inhaled sharply, remembering her wild fear when the man who called himself her master had bridled her power with the necklace. Her whole body felt feeble, the ethereal power which had always pounded through her body like human blood now muted, leashed.

Shhh sh sh sh, she heard, and fingers massages her scalp.

She spun, rolling over, and there was the man at her bedside, his eyes tender, a warm honeyed brown, but something about the slight curl of his taut lips made her uneasy. Sensing predation, she drew further into herself.

But Julian was undeterred. He stroked her hair, easing his knees onto the bed. He smiled.

Good morning, my ethereal little nymph, he said, and with his other hand he reached to the bottom of the bed and produced her robe. I thought you might be more comfortable sleeping without this.  Clothes are a burden for the beautiful. I do hope youve slept well, dear.

Fae shook her head away from his grasp and sat up, drawing her knees to her chest. She stared at him. Why, she said, her voice a whisper, sweet and lights as birdsong, Why have you done this to me?

Julian smiled again, and he put his hands on her knees. She flinched but didnt move. Sweet fairy, he said, You came to me, remember? Hm? You hear me calling, and you came to me, through the door between worlds. Seeking something, werent you? A curious little Fae. You wanted to find me. And now youve got me.

No, she said, her hands going back to her collar.

Yes, said Julian firmly, grasping her wrists and gently pulling them away, taking her hands in his and stroking them with his thumbs. Youre mine now, Fae, so theres no need to be afraid.

Julian felt the fairy relaxing, waning, her hands complacent in his own. He gently let them fall to the down mattress and grasped her knees again, slowly, slowly pulling them apart, feeling them sink, her feet coming towards him. Her eyes were still wild and wide, but the tension in her body was fading. He released her and stood up, taking a goblet from the bedside table and holding it out for her. The fae had no need for mortal sustenance; they fed on the ether itself. She looked puzzled. He put it to her lips.

Drink, my dear.

Her lips parted a little, and she tasted a sip. It was enchanted wine Julian had infused with his own mana and then cast a handy little charm on. To a fairy who was all but robbed of power, he knew it would taste like nectar, his mana as sweet as honey. She immediately grasped the goblet in both hands and poured it down her throat. Greedily licking her lips, she held it out for more, leaning forward now, legs akimbo, her breasts borne forward, suspended like perfect tangerines, her nipples pink buttons surrounded by warmly complected areolas. Julian reached for the decanter and poured another, which she promptly sucked dry, stretching out the goblet again, but her arms faltered a little, as if the goblet had grown heavy, and her eyelashes fluttered, eyelids suddenly looking a touch burdened by some sleepiness. He plucked the goblet from her yielding fingers.

Fae still felt hungry for the liquid the man had given her. She yearned for it. She felt her body tingling, a foreign contentment sweeping through her limbs, pricking her cheeks, enlivening her spirit, making her head light and airy like snow carried on a gentle breeze. She felt unaccountably taken with this man, as if he were an old friend instead of her captor, and she got on her knees to take his hand in hers.

Please, said Fae.

Julian cocked an eyebrow. Please... what, sweet girl?

More.

He pulled his hand from hers and poured another drink, holding it to his chest. Please *what*?

She looked up at him, her chin sunk a little with intoxication, eyes glittering with a look the young mage recognized as longing, but he wasnt sure for whathim or the charmed brew.

1222,"So I actually did a report on this from an engineering perspective (Civil Engineering student). 

A Knuckleball with no rotation will be, like you said, more of a meatball. But, because of the seams, the airflow around the ball differs causing areas of low pressure and high pressure which, in turn, makes the ball move. Different orientations make the ball move in different directions, so if the ball makes a 3/4 turn by the time it gets to the plate, it effectively has exposed as much of its surface to the airflow as efficiently as possible. This makes it flutter, as you said, as it gets to the plate.

There are so many papers and articles written about this pitch. I love it. ",2018-06-06 18:50:01

One day I was in there studying when I heard a thud and a flutter of wings. I thought maybe a bird flew through the open window but looking around I didn't see anything and just assumed it might have been a breeze or something.

The next couple of days, I kept hearing strange squeaks and rustling. My parents didn't believe me when I told them I thought a bird or a bat might have flew in and is trapped somewhere among all the junk, but they searched anyway just to be sure. We ended up finding nothing and eventually the strange noises stop.

Fast forward a year or so later. My parents decided to renovate the room to make it somewhere more comfortable for me and my siblings to study in, so they were clearing out all the old bookcases. And lo and behold, when my dad pulled some boxes out from one of the top shelves, he found a dried up old husk of a bird. Strange thing was, no one smelled anything as though something had died in that room, so we had no idea.

In your opinion. Nothing is solid on this, but given that this term is not fixed in any law or guidance i'd be reluctant to use it. It's a word whose meaning seems to change with who says it.

> That's not what his job is

Correct. His job is to ""keep the peace without fear or favour"". Observe carefully who is being peaceful in this thread. He clearly does not agree with your point, but has not been abusive or insulting at any point... despite provocation.

> If you don't wanna treat people like human beings, then you don't deserve to be treated like one.

Wow. Ok lets take the most charitable line I can. Re-read that again. You have just said that there are times when it is acceptable to not treat people as human beings. I will assume that was not your intention. Surely people should always be treated as human beings... as that is where our value comes from

We are not just our sexuality. Our entire identity is quite literally infinitely larger than just that. You could be easily confused as ""de-humanising"" people by restricting their identity and worth to only their sexuality. Our worth is not defined by our sexuality... nor is our value defined by our identity for that matter.

>We deserve the basic modicum of respect

Indeed... but the pronoun is revealing. Are you defining yourself as a separate subset of humanity? Yet we have already established that your value comes from your humanity, not any other characteristic.

Besides, that works both ways. You are also expected to be respectful, not assault peoples characters and abuse people for simply disagreeing with you. You are better than that.

>For someone with the word stats in their username, you clearly have no idea how they work. 

My PhD and citations say otherwise. But in any case why would that matter here? We aren't discussing statistics, collection of data, processing and analysis, or dissemination of statistics... so why bring it up? Again it just seems as if you are lashing out at everyone around you. For nothing more than disagreeing with you.

> Your contributions to this thread are the most inaccurate things Ive seen in a good long time. 

Then I suggest you read more widely. If you disagree then say so... **it is fine to disagree**. Let's have a discussion. I don't think there is any reason to define a trans-male as *actually* male, whilst you evidently do. It is ok to disagree. I argue there are fundamental truths that except for very rare disorders are at the core of our being and don't just flutter in the wind of public opinion... whereas it appears that you dont.


I hope you read this far. Because *there is nothing wrong with you*. Your value comes from your humanity, not from anything else. Your value is not derived from something that keeps being redefined.

1274,"Here's my assessment:

Good:
- Proper City Siege Map
No more Warhammer 1-wall siege maps. For people that find M2, R2, Attila siege map pathfinding frustrating, worry no more: Traditional Chinese City Planning to the rescue. As you can see, Chinese cities are planned in a very ordered grid pattern with each gates facing the four directions of the wind. This gives a long, straight avenues for advance inside the city while keeping ample opportunities of chokepoints for the defenders. Also check the mountable siege engine on top of the walls.

- UI
I never expected this, but those inkstroke UI looks great!

- Unit Card Design
This is also entirely unexpected: The card highlights only the characteristic weaponry and armour so players can quickly identify the kind of unit at quick glance.

- Hero Type Differentiation
As to be expected. Not all of the RoTK cast are fighters. The most exciting part of RoTK battles for me is the mind battle between the strategists.

- Retainer System
This has multiple great implications: 1> This is a marriage of Rome 2's limited army system with the old Captain system. With this retainer system players can have exceptionally more strategic flexibility, as they can detach a part of an army whenever they need to without having to face thousands of one-unit armies. Players can also rotate their detachment for retraining and replenishing without retreating the entire stack from the frontline. 2>By different Character able to recruit different units, this implies a fiefdom system. For a character to raise an army of retainers, he must have some base of power he owns in the first place. Or, perhaps a character can only recruit from his own fief? If he gang-pressed men from a fief of other character's, it'll trigger dislike between them and starts a feud?

- Dueling Animations
This is necessary for RoTK, and the animations of Xiaohou Dun vs Lu Bu doesn't disappoint.

- Formations
See the Testudo animation? Unlike in R2 where its only have 2 animations (frontmost rank in shieldwall animation, the rest raise shield), it has at least three animation (with addition the flanks faces and protects their sides). Needless to say, the entire concept of formation was missing in Warhammer.

- Banners
The return of animated waving banner. A very welcome return from NTW era (S2 has fluttering banners, but nobori and sashimono's design limited the movement of the cloth). Players playing R2 and Attila's rigid cloth flags and Warhammer no-flag-whatsoever shall be very delighted with this.

- Siege Escalation
See the lower left side of the screen, you'll see a percentage by a building icon. As I understand it, this only means the return of Attila's siege escalation mechanics. The longer you siege a city, the more damaged the city become, thus further reduces the defender's morale

- Capturable Items
Just Incredible. I hope they are shown in the actual battle model, not just numbers and buffs in the background. For example, imagine: Lu Bu's horse, Red Hare, after Xiapi was captured by Cao Cao, and then gifted to Guan Yu.

Bad, but its just Pre-Alpha, can be fixed:
- Where's Liu Bei, Guan Yu, and Zhang Fei? 
They're supposed to be present too. Their models are not finished yet for E3?

- Overall lighting and polish
Don't get me wrong, its decent - but Shogun 2 looks far better than this. Hopefully shall be adjusted

- Over the top animations of rank-and-file soldiers
Mooks capable of kicking and bashing another rank-and-file mooks flying 3 meters high? That's should be reserved for Heroes!

- Hovering Icon Design
Only a friend-or-foe color-coded circle, somewhat similar to Attila. I expected something like Shogun 2, Rome 2, or Warhammer: floating banners bearing the faction's emblem and the unit type below it

Just bad, most likely won't be fixed:
- Return of Empire Total War instant scaling ropes
Insta-scaling really brought down the value of walls and proper preparation of siege engines. Why defend walls if its easily scalable? Why build battering rams and siege towers if everyone can go over walls so easily? C'mon CA, The Chinese were known for their creative siege ladder designs. Its a missing opportunity to show the Chinese Cloud Ladders!
If they want to retain this feature, they better feature falling chance percentage just like in Shogun 2 (in Shogun 2, people can slip and fall when scaling, only ninja can scale without slipping)

- Unmanned Battering Rams
Heaven's sake, this has been plaguing the game since R2. At the least if pushing animations are too expensive for its worth in CA's point of view; make some of the men go inside the engine when pushed and operated, not marching a good 2m behind the engines themselves.

- Counterweight Trebuchet

1278,"That's really it? Hu.

Start doing push ups. That's the go to for CAT training. Although they might have you do something else as women. I'm not super familiar with Australian military training, but assuming it's similar.

I did 12 weeks paramilitary training. Started at 10 push ups for a fuck up and increased it every week by 10. By week 12 if you fucked up you busted out 120 push ups. Yes. I fucked up in the last week.

If you're passing the run I'd suggest increasing your over all cardio vascular endurance over speed of the run. You'll be moving from sprints to body weight drills. Get good at doing a lot of body weight things. Burpees. Jump squats. Wall sits. Flutter kicks. Bear crawling. 8 count body builders. I mean really good. Be able to bust out like 60 burpees no problem.

Thing that will happen is group CAT training. You start as a group and finish as a group. So if you're required to do 40 push ups you all do them together. If someone fails you start over at one. You do this until you get to 40. You do NOT want to be the one who fails at 36.

Whenever Richard Cory went down town,  
  We people on the pavement looked at him:  
  He was a gentleman from sole to crown,  
  Clean favored, and imperially slim.  
  And he was always quietly arrayed,  
  And he was always human when he talked;  
  But still he fluttered pulses when he said,  
  ""Good\-morning,"" and he glittered when he walked.  
  And he was richyes, richer than a king  
  And admirably schooled in every grace:  
  In fine, we thought that he was everything  
  To make us wish that we were in his place.  
  So on we worked, and waited for the light,  
  And went without the meat, and cursed the bread;  
  And Richard Cory, one calm summer night,  
  Went home and put a bullet through his head.

1281,"Some of that stuff has been hinted at in the Rebuilds tho it is still very vague. Im just going to rattle off some random ideas based off of what I saw in the Rebuilds; Ill probably contradict myself but its just brainstorming.

In the 14 years we missed the world went to hell; I know they all believe Shinji did it I wonder. The Mark 06 halted 3rd impact at the end of 2.22; unless that was Kaworu waking up back in time after his death and rewriting history to prevent what we see in 3.33 from happening.

Mk06 is the 12th angel and it was set to run autonomously- which probably just means they gave free will back to the angel within and it charged in and killed Lillith. 

Through out Rebuild, SEELE talk about a covenant they have with Lilith. Since in this version, SEELE are immortal monoliths that have secretly guided humanity for thousands of years, at some point they have made an agreement with Lilith; to protect her from the other angels in exchange for her elevating humanity to a new state of existence -the Infinite (basically transforming the human race into Eva-like immortal beings).

All the Infinite Evas we see in 3.33 are decapitated; thats were all those Eva skulls in central dogma came from. I dont know exactly how it all happened, but I imagine Rebuilds version of Instrumentality occurred prematurely (before all the other angels were killed). Humanity was sacrificed and reborn as the Infinite; the newly formed Evas all gathered around Lilith who somehow absorbed Yuis soul from Unit 01 and took on her shape (like the Rei/Unit 00 after the 10th angels core was shattered). Mk06 shows up and cuts Yui/Liliths head off; resulting in all the Infinite Evas heads to fall off too.

Somehow, Liliths head was spirited away as Mk06 merged with Liliths body and attempted to take control of Instrumentality. The headless Infinite Evas charged after Liliths head, hence why they were scattered all over but their skulls were left in Central Dogma (like how Mk09 can operate without its head).

Someone or something slammed that seal over Central Dogma; it could have been sealing Mk06 off from the rest of the universe. This froze the Mk06 in its tracks; not frozen in time tho. Gendou has Yui back; trapped in Liliths head.

I suspect that WILLE is Rebuilds version of how Kaji was giving information to the Japanese government, only this time, Kaji (and Mari) are part of an alternate group who know Gendou wants to pervert Instrumentality for his own ends and they want to stop him. Kaji cod have stollen the research from Bethany Base to turn Angels into machines (like they were trying to do to the 3rd angel in 2.22), given it WILLE and they used it to build the Wundar from the 11th angel. How? I dunno really.

The central conflict was to protect Lilith from the angels; given she was the 2nd Angel all the lesser angels might want to kill her and take her place as 2nd. Kaworu didnt care because he was the 1st angel; he was above Lilith (above everyone) and so he just amused himself and went along with SEELE to meet Shinji. 

SEELE wanted the covenant with Lilith to come to fruition (to start Instrumentality) but they might have had their own goals or might have taken issue with Gendous interference. 

They talk about a catalyst or trigger a lot, so Instrumentality probably needs someone/something to kick it off and decide its outcome. After absorbing Rei/Unit 00, Unit 01 becomes that catalyst, but at the same time do did Shinji (and the Rei trapped in Unit 01 I assume). Maybe to create the catalyst you need to merge a man and woman who love each other into one being (sexual innuendo, yay!). Probably not, because Shinji is still a trigger after separating from Rei, but its an idea.

With the Angels all dead, all that is left is Instrumentality. SEELE wanted X to be the goal of Instrumentality. Gendou wanted Y to be the goal. Misato and the rest of NERV thought Z was the goal and WIILE wanted none of it to happen and for humanity to be left alone. SEELEs X-goal fell on its face, but they were happy to go along with Gendous Y-goal because it more or less worked for them. Misato and the rest, when they realised Z was not going to happen and Y would suck, banded together with WILLE to stop it all together. Something like that.

After Shinji tried and failed to enact W-goal (fixing everything) and added more to Gendous Y-goal instead, hes probably only got two options now. 

1. Give up and do nothing like EoE Shinji did. Or;
2. Join WILLE and fight NERV.

In the end tho, I wouldnt be surprised if Shinji sacrifices himself to prevent everything from happening; imagine if he gets Unit 01 back and everything turns to shit (Y-goal style) and Shinji just self destructs Unit 01, killing himself and destroying the last trigger.

Chuck in an epilogue scene where Asuka and Mari meet each other at Misatos funeral years later (she died of old age) and they talk about how humanity still hates Shinji but no one else knows the truth; that he was a hero who saved humanity. Cut to Asuka seeing Shinji standing next to Rei- then fluttering birds and theyre both gone. Asuka smiles to herself... idiot. The camera zooms out to see the city theyre in being built on the coast of a blue sea. Role credits.

Thats kinda how I would love 3.0+1.0 to end; forget all the death and misery from NGE/EoE and come up with something new and positive.

1294,"I was in constant contact with my best friend two years ago. We went to somewhat close universities and I visited him at his university at least once during the school year and were always around each other during the summer when we were back home. I remember everything leading up to his death so vividly. I had failed to get an internship and was back home for the summer, feeling miserable and like I was worthless because I was working a lifeguard job while my peers were off in the industry being successful. I was perusing through snapchat stories and noticed my best friend had put two old computer cases on his story with a caption saying thanks to his internship for giving the old machines to him. He had plans to repair and repurpose them. Being interested in computers myself, I offered to help him out with the restorations. We made plans on Friday evening for the next morning, as his family would be back from vacation and I had work in the afternoon. The next morning rolls around and I message him through snapchat again, saying to respond whenever he is ready for me to come over and get started. This was around 9am. About an hour and a half later, I send another message. I was running out of time before I needed to leave for work and wanted to get some meaningful work done with my best friend. He still hasn't opened the snapchat messages. Later on, I send him a text, just in case his internet is down. No response. At that point, I had to get to work. I send him one last message saying sorry about missing him and that I had to head out, reminding him to let me know the next time he wanted to work on the computers. On my way out, I had a a guy feeling of intuition. I thought about running by his house to knock on the door to see what was going on. It wasn't like him to ignore me, or anyone for that matter. I shook off the feeling, chalking it up to his family ariving home early and making him do chores, homework (yes, even during the summer. Even when he was in college), or something of the sort. The rest of the day is a monotonous blur. I went to bed and woke up around the same time as the day before the next morning. I reached for my phone to send a text to my best friend, but was stopped short by a single message from another good friend of mine. The text said ""Hey, give me a call when you wake up."" At that moment my stomach sunk and my heart fluttered. I knew what I was about to hear on this phone call. According to his family, he had killed himself sometime between Friday night and Saturday morning. There was no note. There was nothing to explain what happened. So many questions rushed to my head. Why didn't I go to his house? Why would he make plans with me if he was going to do that? Why did he go talk to his other best friend that night with no indiciation of his pain? It was a rush of emotions like nothing I had ever experienced before. The guy that I had known and grown up with since I was 10 was gone. Our Kingdom Hearts marathons and speed run attempts were gone. The only thing I had left of him was the memories we made together. The emotional overload continued until I finished carrying his casket from the hearse to his grave. I was still upset and confused, but in a way, I was able to take some solace knowing he was in a better place and I helped to carry him there. I still miss him and think about him every day.

After his recent heart surgery he was told to avoid stress, so he let himself slide into the background more and more. The one time each week he would completely let himself go was if he got to play DnD. Reginald would cease to exist and the broad-shoulderd Sigurd would take his place. A brave human barbarian, just recentley arrived in IceWind Dale. Friday came around as always, and this week they would start the hunt for the ice giants that roamed the icy north.

At least, that was the last Reginald remembered. He lifted his head slowly up. The sound was all wrong, to much noise, laughing, singing, clashing cups. All in all way more then his four friends could ever produce. The light was to sharp and he had to blink a couple of times. Once. Twice. And his surroundings got clearer and clearer.
These people were not his friends, the men and women here seemed like a rough lot. And this was not Dave's livingroom, this was a giant hall, bustling with people...

I raided some shores in England and all went well and all was good. But then their new king, Alfred-"" she spit out his name ""had to ruin all the fun. Long story short, i took an axe to the face."" She actually said it with a stupid grin.
""I'm not Si-"" Reginald started, but he stopped. *Guess this is happening any way* he thought, *might as well commit to this*. ""We were fighting giants actually. Ice giants if you want to know."" *Yeah, this felt allright!* ""And I swung my mighty axe, going for his bare neck - but was I going to kill him?"" Reginald always could recount his DnD stories with a certain flair, to bad the only people interested in those stories were his fellow DnD players. ""And then, wouldn't you know it, the magic 20 and I just knew the giant was slayed!""
Strange looks were thrown his way. ""What is this '20' you speak of, some spell?"" Thorsten asked. And as Reginald opened his mouth and thoughts were racing through his head *How am I going to explain this?* something tugged at his chest - no, in his chest.

""3! 2! 1! Clear"" the paramedic shouted. A jolt went through Reginald's still body. Nothing. ""Again!"" Nothing. ""Come on Regi,you can do this - Again!"". A blip on the monitor in the ambulance.
Reginald's eyes fluttered and in the brief instance before he fell unconcious again, all he saw was the roof of an ambulance and all he heard were the sirens.
All he thought, was *damn, why couldn't i stay?*",2018-06-09 02:07:27

1313,"Ok, first of all, this song has production taken straight out of the Flume text book:

* Reese bass 

* ""Fluttery"" melodic lines 

* Heavy use of automation 

* Use of multiple rhythmic devices such as 1/8th note triplets, 1/4 note triplets sextuplets, straight 16th notes, over the bar line phrases

* Minimal chord progression, IV maj 7th, I, ii min 7th  (Flume uses this exact chord progression a lot)

* Pitched down vocals

* Lots of pitch bend in melodic and vocal lines

* 'Loose' drum programming instead of straight to the grid 

* Arp pattern that modulates between different rates

If you don't know who Flume is, I would strongly recommend checking him out. This Taska Black person is basically just blatantly copying Flume's style.

Her slow writhing presses her breasts into him, their soft, warm flesh swollen and sensitive with the flush of her arousal.

She purrs, loving the feeling of him still hard inside her. Clamping down on him weakly as she wriggles her hips, she smiles up at him lovingly, nibbling her lip in a way that combines with her blush to make her look shy, vulnerable, eager to please.

The soft petting, the tenderness of this moment, the simple affection and gentle stimulation is just what she needed. A necessary reprieve from the mind-blowing sex of mere minutes ago.

Every loving kiss, every affectionate ear scratch heals her sanity, calms her mind, brings her back to normal.

And from there arouses her anew.

She whimpers when she feels his fingers at the base of her tails. How easy would it be for him to drive her over the edge again? A fourth time? A fifth?

Mere minutes.

""Please,"" she begs, voice hoarse and shaking. ""Not yet.""

Like you, I worried almost constantly about my heart function, and blood clots. I get extra heart beats (PACs) which are infrequent, but would cause a panic attack every time they happened. So, knowing that they were going to happen no matter what, I started practicing not caring. I'd feel the flutter, then immediately interrupt the panic-thought by saying to myself ""No. Stop. You are safe. Nothing is wrong"". And then moving on.

1333,"Hey man. So I was on a 2 day Ayahuasca weekend. Similar to your story, I had an amazing first trip. Felt loved and cared for and though I was accepted. My ego was strong though and I had never taken any psychedelics before. I was not experienced enough to know how to deal with any negative feelings that may arise. When, on the second night, my feelings shifted (after another amazing experience) I didn't understand that it was my subconscious fears manifesting in front of my eyes. I also didn't realise that panicking in the face of this manifestation would cause the fear to increase and overpower me. Like this video of a man staring down an elephant: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9WW3QbOgQA I needed to not react internally to the fears. Similar to the man with the elephant - If I react with fear and panic, then I would get destroyed by my fears. Unfortunately I didn't know any of this at the time and I thought I was being attacked by a demon and that it was trying to possess me. Needless to say my heart rate went through the roof. I felt fear and panic like I have never ever felt before and I completely lost the run of myself. When I eventually calmed down I was so shell shocked that I was terrified. I was shaking with fear. For the next 3 weeks I couldn't sleep by myself as I was hearing things that weren't there. I had to call a few friends who allowed me to sleep next to them or on the floor next to them so that I would feel safe.
I suddenly had an anxiety disorder (which I never had before) and I was convinced that I had had a heart attack (although my bloods came back clear after an ECG scan and stress test, so the doctors told me that I didn't have any heart attack - just an unusual heart rhythm) and I still questioned whether I had been attacked by a demon or not or whether I had been possessed or not. I basically experienced what it was like to be schizophrenic for the initial month afterwards - I had a total identity crisis, not knowing what to believe or how to move forward from this event. From talking with friends that I trust, I slowly came to believe that I had manifested the visions and that there are no demons, aside from the ones we manifest from our own subconscious. That was the starting point for my recovery - accepting that I had some unhelpful beliefs - I had to let go of the ideas that were hindering me. The next thing that helped, ironically, was another psychedelic experience - MDMA. I was very hesitant to return back to taking any psychedelics, as you can imagine, but my brother was experienced and convinced me that it is exactly what I needed. I took Ayahuasca because I didn't want to abuse drugs and use them just to party - I wanted spiritual insights - and so taking this step was difficult for me. Now I was just taking drugs to escape myself. The thing was I needed to escape myself. My Self was the problem that even a high dose of Ayahuasca couldn't fully evaporate for long enough for me to shed my ideas and conceptions. That MDMA experience was pure bliss. With friends in a nightclub, I was so happy and free of negativity. It showed me that I wasn't possessed. It showed me that if a tiny pill can rid me of my mental issues, then I realised that I am the problem. The way I was viewing the world was my issue. I realised that since the Ayahuasca, I had been focusing on my heart all the time and again, like I was when I was high, I was manifesting the heart flutters.
When I became sober after the MDMA I had a blank slate to progress again. I took ownership of the bad trip, my reaction to it, my inflated identification with my ego, and my recovery process. I decided to believe that my heart was fine, that I wasn't possessed, and that I was in control of my life.
From that point on I decided that in order to heal myself, I had to help others and become less self-centered in my approach to life. I returned to University to study Psychology. I just got my results from my first year in UCD yesterday and they were good. I feel like psychedelic assisted therapy is my calling and I hope to bring this revolutionary approach to mental illness to my country (Ireland)
My recovery was a slow process:
1. Understanding of what had happened - Ignoring the crazies who told me I had lost my soul and reading lots of books on psychedelics, the mind-body connection, and shamanism (although I take a lot of the shamanism with a pinch of salt. I have learned a lot of helpful information from shamanism, but you really have to sift through the dirt to find the gold)
2. Taking control of my mind once I had identified it as the problem: Yoga, Meditation (I still struggle with this), Wim Hof Method works for me though - Deep breathing technique and cold water exposure. The cold water exposure teaches you to calm your mind when the initial reaction is to panic when the cold water shock hits.
3. Time
4. Milder psychedelics in smaller doses. Cannabis at first, then MDMA, then LSD and over the past few months Psilocybin mushrooms. This has been a slow familiarisation process. Smoking Cannabis infrequently has been a huge help as it is a gentle space where I can learn to calm myself and learn to deal with the scarier aspects of my psyche. MDMA showed me that happiness is in my own hands. LSD showed me I still have a lot to work on. Magic Mushrooms - 3+ years later - have showed me that I am on the right path, that I am strong and that I have dis-identified with my ego to a far healthier degree. This was a long slow infrequent process. For the first year after the Ayahuasca I basically had nothing. Then I smoked a joint maybe 4 times over a 6 month period (but I have a fully immersive trip when I do so) and I had only 2 MDMA trips and 1 LSD trip - I didn't go mad at all. I needed to learn, not abuse, and luckily I was able to walk that line. Magic mushrooms have only been a recent development, and I was very excited about their possibilities. Anti-anxiety, non toxic, no downside other than the possibility of a bad trip - But I had somewhat mastered my mind enough so that was no longer a worry unless I took too much (I am yet to take more than 2.5g - yesterday - It was beautiful) This post was a little sadness post as I discovered that magic mushrooms might have a downside after all - Heart Effects - but I am unsure if this is just because I had 2 coffees that day. I would say now that I still have only had a few trips on Magic Mushrooms and I started with very small amounts, then half a gram, then a gram, then 1.5g, then 2g, and yesterday 2.5g. This has been a slow process as I'm not willing to risk my psyche to psychedelic induced psychosis again.
5. Practical steps to improve my life. Returning to Uni. Examining my behaviour and attitudes. Avoiding unhelpful behaviours in almost all shapes and forms. Nutrition, exercise routine, attitudes towards sex, playing video games for too long, vanity, social media, relationships. I basically tried to throw out all my habits and beliefs to rebuild a new and improved self. This was extremely difficult and I failed and still fail a lot, but I have improved to the point where I actually love myself - The self being a phantom of course - but I am delighted with the self I am choosing to create. It's now, for the first time in my life, fun to be me. I am working, studying, progressing, growing etc. I am more confident. I am on a path to a career that will help others. I can't remember who said it, but the quote goes something like this: I help others as a means to helping myself and I help myself as a means to help others. This approach is symbiotic and it really seems to work. I needed to stop focusing on me. My problems. My PTSD. My recovery. All that was still ego and self orientated. So I tried to focus on how I could be a valuable member of the community. I am a people person and I am intuitive and I am empathetic so I am suited to helping people through difficult mental issues. Focusing outwards has helped me a lot in return. We are all one after all.
6. Love and support from friends and certain members of my family I can trust - My brother.

I could write a book on this whole experience my friend, but I think that is enough for now.

I am fallible and I am as clueless as to life as the next person, but I have created a persona that I now enjoy. I needed to go my own path (My parents didn't think returning to Uni to study Psychology was a good idea - although they have come round - and so I had to go against their advice, which was difficult for the person I used to be i.e. someone who needed external validation, especially from my parents, when acting.

That Ayahuasca, and the subsequent mental break, led to lots of pain, including losing any chance of reconciliation with my ex-wife, but in all honestly it has been the best thing for me. Without all that pain and confusion I would still be the old me. I would still be lost in a lot of pain and illusion. Losing my mind was exactly what I needed, which is easy to say in hind sight, but from my current vantage point, it is true.  Pain = potential for growth.

So honestly man, my recovery took over my whole existence. I was also living in Australia and had been for a decade. I moved home to Ireland, which was another huge decision.

I hope that you find peace. If you need any advice - books to read for example - give me a shout and I'll talk with you.

Do the right things NOW and the future will sort itself out buddy.

Peace. M",2018-06-09 06:26:34
1334,"Buy some arky jigs.  Arky jigs are a good all around jig.  You can flip it, skip it under a dock, or cast it out into deeper water.  I really like www.dctbaits.com.  The owner is also a member here and hand makes great jigs and shares a lot of good info.  Buy more than a few as you will lose your jigs because you're tossing em into some type of cover.  However, I've had really good luck tossing the DCT Jigs into heavy cover and haven't lost many of them yet.  They come through the tulles pretty well and rarely get hung up so far.  Hooks are sharp and the jig skirt colors are beautiful.

I'd say get a few arkys in a DA PURP and some Black and Blue.  Two basic colors to get going and get some jig trailers.  

Jig trailers you can go with matching colors to make it easy and get two types of trailers.  A dead action trailer like a Sweet Beaver or Strike King Rodent, which doesn't have much action as the jig descends to the bottom or you can pair it with a something with a lot of flutter, like Strike King Rage Tail Craws or Netbait Paca Craws/Chunks.

More often than not, I tend to use Sweet Beavers as I believe my pressured bass here in So Cal are finicky and tend to like it better.  

I prefer to toss my jigs on braid to fluoro leaders (30lb to 40lb braid and 16lb to 20lb fluoro)and throw em wherever you want.  It's like Gerald Swindle says, if you can throw a worm, you can throw a jig!  I like to toss my jigs and let em hit the bottom.  I'll drag the jig a bit then if I feel a rock or some type of structure, give it two lil pops and watch my line and reel the slack in.  I've been hit immediately after giving the jig two pops.  I've also been bit when I've made my first cast and I'm letting the jig sink to the bottom.  You got to be ready anytime and watch your line when you're jig fishing.

Good luck!",2018-06-09 06:51:11
1335,"First of all, get that idea of you looking horrible out of your head. When you make eye contact with the camera it honestly made my heart flutter. You are my type in many ways and if I was single I prob would ask for your number... anyway:

I have a friend who talks exactly like you and unfortunately he doesnt take my advice but I hope you at least consider it. 

* Go on a date with every match. You never know if you find that girl who is young and cute but maybe is a couple pounds over weight or average. She may express interest in athletics and you two could use that as eventual date material to go to the gym together, run relays or races, do sports and build bonds through that. You could find a restaurant that serves amazing food and have a restaurant thats yours. And when you both feel healthy and look amazing the you will have built that up and went through the tough part together. (She doesnt need to be huge just more average with a brain to think for herself instead of always going for the hottest one...if that makes sense)

* Get a social hobby. I honestly suggest one that has a lot of single girls in it and the one I think would be great is singing. You are probably a baritone and theres lots of single ladies in the chorus of community theatre shows and choirs that would absolutely love you if you sing. Yoga and co ed sports also come to mind... 

* Work on confidence and eye contact. I love me some eye contact. You are a very deep person and a lot of people are surface fake people (especially those mega hot super models you prob want ) and every day person who loves conversation just wants someone to ask them back about their day. They want to person to genuinely listen to them while looking at them, asking follow up questions, and responding with their own story (thats not a one upper story) but really adds to the conversation. (My friend is the worst at listening to other people and hearing what they say! Not sure if you do this but many people seem to have lost this skill over the years)

* You look fine and any nonsuperficial women will realize you are in your 30s. Baldness is normal. Heck, even grey hairs are normal. Gaining weight is normal in middle age and so are those weird nose and ear hairs (doesnt hurt to trim them though!)

* Dont play the pity party. Just as much as you are on tinder or whatever talking to many women they are on there talking to many men. Its like a job interview right? You could nail the interview but if the candidate after you if just a tad better hes getting hired right? Doesnt mean no one liked you or wanted you and there is just A better one more suitable and they gotta pick one. You have to keep trying right? Right place right time lands you the position.

1342,"Well with the preface that I am fully aware of how pretentious I sound when I talk like this, alright.

That feeling, the flutter you get when you've made a real connection with someone. When you've actually fallen in love for the first time and you just *know it*. A lot of us throw the word around without really understanding the feeling, especially when we're younger, but then someone special enters your life and for the very first time you have that sensation of ""true"" love.

It's special, the sensation and situation around it are completely unique to you. Nobody is going to feel that love in the same way you will right in that moment and yet we all experience it at some point. There's no other emotion like it. That love is unique, it's special, it makes you want to spread that joy to others in whatever way you can just like the OP did by making this thread. 

None of us know the OP but we can almost all empathize with how they are feeling right now because we have felt it before or we are going to feel it eventually. When you open yourself up to a connection like that and want share it with the world... It's just the most human thing you can possibly experience. 

The moment is fleeting. Eventually that heart flutter will pass and you'll go back to life as it was. You'll feel it again but who knows when? There is so much you can learn about yourself in that moment, so much good can come of it but we let it pass us by without learning. When you take that moment and make it a part of yourself it is empowering. 

When you manage to keep that feeling, that open connection in mind in your day to day life it changes how you interact with others. It can help make you the best version of yourself that you can possibly be, and that is what we should all strive for. In your darkest moments, remember it. If you ever lose faith in people, remember it. Whenever life seems like it's just not worth the effort, *remember it*.

This all probably reads as nonsense from a bad romance novel but I swear it to be true. In short, you will be at your most human when you feel true love and you'll make yourself a better person if you try and spread that feeling through the rest of your life.

most of the crowd was confused after the lip sync so i imagine watching it on tv wont be much better. its just gonna be like a that was it? sorta thing. 

i HOPE its an iconic moment where at the perfect time, Asia rips off titties to reveal live butterflies but instead of triumphantly flutterring up and around her, half of them just fall to the ground dead, but im expecting something melodramatic tbh. ",2018-06-09 09:24:17

>**Kenku Names**

>Given that Kenku can duplicate any sound, their names are drawn from a staggering variety of noises and phrases. Kenku names tend to break down into three categories that make no distinction between male and female names. 

>Kenku thugs, warriors, and toughs adopt noises made by weapons, such as the clang of a mace against armor or the sound made by breaking bone. Non-Kenku refer to the Kenku by describing this noise. Examples of this type of name include Smasher, Clanger, Slicer and Basher. 

>Kenku thieves, con artists, and burglars adopt animal noises, typically those common to urban settings. In this manner, Kenku can call out to each other while those who overhear them mistake them for common animals. Non-Kenku use names that refer to the sound made or the animal a Kenku mimics, such as Rat Scratch, Whistler, Mouser, and Growler. 

>Some Kenku turn their back on crime to pursue legitimate trades. These Kenku adopt noises made as part of their craft. A sailor duplicates the sound of a fluttering sale, while a smith mimics the clanging of a hammer on metal. Non-Kenku describe these folk by their trades sounds, such as Sail Snap, Hammerer, and Cutter.

1363,"The chime on the door rang sharp and crystalline.  You dont remember walking in, but here you are, standing in the entryway of a brightly lit 50s diner.  Everything is immaculately clean.  An old record jukebox sits in the corner, sadly quiet despite the ambiance of everything else. Bright yellow padding on the seats invites you to sit down and make yourself comfortable.  Theres also plenty of room at the counter, next to the revolving pie stand kept behind glass.  The flavors are cherry and peach today.  You take a moment to glance from side to side, realizing that theres nobody here but you.  
Whatll it be, chief? says a man that seems to have appeared out of nowhere.  He sets a glass of water down on the counter as you settle into a seat.  His smile is bright and cheerful, but also unnerving.  Theres something not quite right about him, but you cant figure out what.  Hes far too handsome to be at a job like this, for starters.  High cheekbones.  Milky white skin.  A sharp and narrow jawline.  Golden eyes that glittered under the light of the fluorescents.  Looks like he should be on magazine covers, not working for tips at a joint like this.  His movements are calm and relaxed, but his enthusiasm is like a fluttering bird.  You think at any moment he might flit to another table, but then recall that youre the only one here.
    Eggs, over-easy, you speak up.  The thought of good food is comforting, and you add to your order without pause.  Side of hash, thick cut of bacon, you nod, glad to have found your voice which seems to put everything into a bit more focus.  Everything doesnt seem quite as fuzzy as it once did.  Not quite so bright and disoriented.  Your waiter leans back to shout to whoever seems to be cooking in the kitchen.  Two flops, sweep the floor with an overland trout! and then goes back to wiping glasses with a dish rag.  He gives you that disarming smile again.  Not wanting to stare for having a lack of anything better to do at the moment, you notice his nametag.  Luc, you say it out loud, and the grin he wears stretches farther.  Youd swear it was all the way up to his eyes.  Those bright citrine eyes.  He smiles like he knows something you dont.  Like hes waiting for a prank to playthrough.  The other shoe to drop.  Its no fun explaining a joke if the recipient doesnt get it.  Your food comes quickly.  With only a pause to admire the beauty of breakfast cuisine, you dig in like you havent eaten in days.  It is gone before youve a chance to savor it.  You dont remember the last time you had anything that tasted so perfect before.  Youre near to weeping when you realize there is none left.  This will be a five star on Yelp for sure.
    The bill comes and Luc slides it casually across the marble countertop to you.  You lean forward to examine it, reaching into your coat to fetch your wallet where it should always be.  Excuse me, Luc? you raise a finger in concern.  He turns to you with that smile again.  This doesnt have the price on it.
    Aah, Luc explains, Thats because youve already paid.
I what?
Mhmm, he says again.  You hear the door lock behind you.  Now you get it.  Now you understand the joke being played here.
    One human soul, the devil tells you, looking like hes about to burst with excitement.

1367,"**Prompt 4:** Write someone reading an excerpt from the Randy Dowager Quarterly story inspired by the Inquisition.

**Mildly NSFW**

------

Olivia Trevelyan was about to retire for the night when Varric, looking unusually disquieted, asked her for a private audience. Bemused, she led him into her quarters where he let out a heavy sigh and handed her a bundle of papers, averting his eyes as he did.

I confiscated this from a kitchen maid, he said. Thought you might want to know about this.

What is it? Olivia frowned. She wasnt looking forward to putting out yet another fire, but whatever this was it seemed to bother her companion to no end.

Ill... let you see for yourself. Varric didnt look at her as he kept shifting uneasily from one foot to another while she examined the parchment.

It appeared to be some sort of periodical that consisted of no more than a few dozen pages. The missive looked fairly nondescript with nothing but a few passages on the front page that described its nature:

*The Randy Dowager heralds Summerday with the collected* Rift and Sword*, being an enticing tale of a mage and a warrior come together in a congress of mind and body. The courage of their days is matched only by the passion of their nights.*

*The Randy Dowager: Exhibitions for the noble of thought, but spry of step.*

*The Lady herself says: A fortress besieged with weapons such as these has no other choice or indeed intention but to surrender and embrace its sweet demise. Four scarves fluttered in shock out of five. - RD*

Olivia had a brief look at the first paragraph on one of the more worn out pages, clearly read more than any other:

*The rift between her thighs held more allure and mystery than anything the Fade could offer, promising him pleasures the likes of which he had never felt before. Her body was his temple and he would worship at her shrine tonight. Without another world he kneeled before her, his lips a prayer against her-*

Oh, Olivia winced, Its *that* kind of story. 

The pervasive nature of such literature was no surprise to her. Quite a few of these writings circulated around the Ostwick Circle as well as the ladies drawing room at her parents estate. She even made an attempt to read one, before she had to abandon her pursuit, having laughed herself silly at the repeated mentions of heaving bosoms and burning loins.

She shrugged, not quite sure why Varric of all people would find this offensive. The maid has a poor in taste in literature, but I dont think theres any harm is this.

Read on, Peaches, Varric mumbled, tugging anxiously at the sleeves of his jacket.

Perplexed, Olivia flicked through the serial until a passage caught her eye:

*Your counsel is invaluable as always, Commander, she murmured, her voice the sweetest music to his ears. There is but one way I can express my gratitude.*

*Her hand glowed a mystic green as she reached out towards him, setting his senses ablaze when her fademark touched his skin.*

*Inquisitor, he whispered as he closed his eyes, surrendering himself to her caress.*

Oh no. No, no, no, no.

Its-Its, Olivia stammered, Varric, its...

Speechless, she slid down onto the chaise, looking in disbelief at the stack of parchment in her hand. 

The revelation was difficult to absorb. She was getting used to the fact that the role she found herself in caused no small amount of rumours and speculations about her life and the nature of her relationship with her inner circle, but she never could have imagined someone would use her private life for... *gratification*. Yet evidence to the contrary was in front of her, plain as day. And people in this very fortress were indulging in it. She doubted she could ever look any of the kitchen staff in the eye. Looking at Varric was proving difficult enough.

What do I do with this? she asked him helplessly.

The dwarf sighed. 

In my experience its better to leave these things alone. Or, he added hastily when she shot him an affronted look, you could talk to Ruffles. See if she can do something about this mess before any major damage is done.

Too late for that Im afraid. Olivia groaned, the images conjured by the missive still vivid in her mind, I doubt I will ever look at a Rift the same way ever again.",2018-06-09 14:08:13

Lessee here. Hi, I've been an off-again on-again wishlister for a while. Who am I? I'm 46, male, live currently in NYC. I went back to school a few years ago and am currently at Columbia as a senior in the History Dept. I do research for money, and spend a lot of time looking over declassified govt docs trying to answer whatever pressing question my boss has posed at the time. Currently am supposed to be looking at diplomatic cables and identifying those that use hostile language like ""unacceptable"" and ""our nation will respond"" etc. It is dry and tedious mostly as you might expect, but occasionally I find something fascinating that gets folks all in a flutter around here. I'm working on developing a thesis around the outlaws of the old west, as being victims of a sort who had little choice, and were sometimes not even criminals. An ancestor was in one of the bandit gangs in the late 1800s and I thought it would be fun to put his story into context. After this, it's off to grad school. So I will be nose to books for a few years yet, but I wanna get a PhD so I can say, ""It's Doctor Xokolatl, thank you."" Aside from schoolin' I have been a roadie for funk and punk bands, been to every state at least briefly, in that capacity. Ive slanged cappuccinos and lattes, and can make foam solid enough to use as a pillow for a few days, at a mom and pop cafe somewhere, all over SoCal. I've been inside a volcano in a helicopter, um, I've done road trips just because, I've had poetry published, um, I like chocolate and coffee. and cigarettes. And I dunno, I read a fuckton, mostly old sci-fi, because those guys are fun.

I like blue and purple, and oh, never married and never had kids, so far as I know.

1370,"Long story time:

So two days (nights...?) ago I was banging my girl, and after finishing i felt a little different, was immediately ready for round two. Now i wont claim to be super man, on a good day i need like a solid 15 mins to recover, so this was new, but hey i wasnt complaining. So we got at it again, finish and again same thing. Now. I'm off cycle and i dont take any cialis or viagra (though i was starting to think my girl slipped me some) so idk whats going on, but we go round three (bless her for keeping up) and after that im really out of breath.

So im lying in bed and she's lying beside me arm/head across my chest. I'm feeling a little dizzy but i've never done 3 rounds of sex back to back to back, so im thinking thats probably normal. But then my girl tells me my chest feels like its beating fast and hard (now i dont remember what i said, but im 100% certain it was a horrible joke about ""fast and hard"" all i remember is getting the death glare from her.

So i close my eyes and try to feel my heartbeat, and yeah its a little fast and some hard beats, but shes looking really concerned so i go to check my pulse (im a nurse). Fingers on my neck and i swear i felt one of the weirdest heart rhythms ever.

So im like shit that aint right. I go to stand up and all i remember is waking up lying sideways in bed with her putting my pants on. And since im an idiot, i make a joke about how this is hardly the time to go for round 4 (it kinda looked like she eas taking my pants off since they were at my knees). Well if i thought i got the death eyes BEFORE, i have never in my life seen someone's eyes look so angry then she did right there.

So i get dressed and next thing i remember im in the passenger seat of the car and she's driving me to the hospital. Important fact: i am 6 foot tall around 195lbs (im off cycle and its summer cutting time pls no bully) and she is 5'2 and maybe 110-120? Idk im bad at guessing weight and i may be an idiot but i aint asking a woman how much she weighs. Basically shes tiny and i have no idea how she got me in the car (but the next day my back and the back of my head really hurt so im pretty sure i got dragged down the stairs and across the driveway.

So anyway we're at the hospital (where i work) in the ER (where i sometimes work) and of course all the staff are people i work with and recognise me. So i get my vitals checked and my bp is like 85/52 or something and my heart rate is jumping between 160-190 bpm.

That aint good. So they do an ecg and im in rapid a-flutter, but all the nurses are telling me they've never seen someone as young as me with such a shitty heart rhythm so hey, at least i got that going for me.

So i see doc and OF COURSE its the young doc i talk to about cars all the time (why wouldnt it be?) So i tell him the story, i can see him trying to hold back laughter. 100% chance he'd be laughing if my girl wasnt beside me. So im getting iv fluids, heart meds etc... and my bp comes up, my heart beat comes down, but im now in an a-fib rhythm (but its controlled so its k) they still want to monitor me so i get admitted to the cardiac unit i used to work on for 3 years! Yaay

And of course the nurses are all the nurses that were on my rotation and i worked with all the time, so they recognize me immediately. So im getting pushed in the wheelchair and my girl is still walking beside me looking all sheepish and embarassed. I get to the room and its a private room (thank u employee benefits) and my nurse goes to put the cardiac monitor on me. She says something about me working out, and im like ""yeah, i do yoga and wing chun, just want to be toned for summer"". Im still not sure if she knew i was joking, she seemed to believe me and i didnt have the heart to tell her.

At this point its like 3am, and i tell my girl she can go back home and sleep, but she says shes tired and doesnt want to drive home. So she climbs in the tiny hospital bed with me and we lie there listening to the relaxing sounds of call bells and the dementia patient screaming he cant be in this prison because he pays his taxes.

At this point i nudge my girl and point to the heart monitor and tell my girl ""hey, its a private room, so if you're feeling frisky we can watch my heart go crazy in real time"" while rubbing her thigh. She starts laughing (a little too hard) i had been making bad puns all night and she was really annoyed, so i think i finally broke her

Got maybe an hour of sleep but whatever. Day nurse is a young new hire who started after i left so she doesnt know me. She's making jokes about having to put in a catheter , and i say ""well you gotta let me fluff it up a bit first, im only wearing a hospital gown and its a little chilly"". My girl is back to being annoyed with my jokes :(

She goes home to sleep and shower (i told her she was smelly, and she said its because she was sleeping next to me and i rubbed off on her)

I do a bunch of tests echo (fancy ultrasound of heart) stress test (that treadmill heart monitor thing) and its all normal, i converted back to sinus rhythm (normal heart rhythm) some point in the early morning.

My old manager for that unit (who i wanted to smash) and my new manager (who i also want to smash) come say hi to me (i guess an employee being admitted is a big deal) they both know why im admitted so its a little awkward.

Friday goes by and nothing happens after the tests. Im monitored over night and nothing happens. This morning at 8 doc comes in, tells me they dont know why it happened but to take it easy for the next few weeks until i see him as a follow up, and discharges me. I got home about an hour ago. Have to stay away from the gym for at least 2 weeks,and im on a low dose beta blocker for 60 days. And im off work for 2 weeks as well so im going to go crazy at home. Send help.

Sorry for the long post, was an interesting expeirience and i thought u guys could use a laugh at my expense.

 

Tl;dr: i fucked my girl so hard i went into a dangerous heart rhythm and got admitted to the hospital i work at so all my co workers know.",2018-06-09 14:52:35

1393,"[](/starlightspittle)So, I guess this was a weird one for me. I really like a lot of their pockets of Mane 6 interacting with the Mean 6. I think it is also pretty clear that this episode is setting us up for something else, possibly coming into the season finale. [](/sp)

[](/ajeesh)However, there were a lot of strange things with this one. 

First of all, the anti-Mane 6 personalities is something already done all the way back in season 2 with the Return of Harmony. Flutterjerk and Applelie are already long-established things. Although this time we got to see both normal and anti-Mane 6 characters interacting at once, it did feel a lot like ""this has been done before"".[](/sp)

[](/squintyglam)The other slightly weird thing was that the Mane 6 literally never needed to do anything to resolve the issue. They may have made amends after all the misunderstandings with the Mean 6, but they never came to any sort of conclusion that magic might have been involved.

It's also true that the Mean 6 burned themselves out on the elements entirely on their own. In very much a Raider of the Lost Ark kinda way, the heroes didn't need to do anything for the bad guys to melt their own faces on the power they did not understand. [](/sp)

[](/twisheepish)I guess we'll need to see where this goes later in the season. As it stands, there's definitely a lot more potential we can have with a Chrysalis and anti-Mane 6 villain combo.",2018-06-09 16:20:01
1394,"Tiny Pop (they of Season 6 infamy) aired this here in the UK a few days ago, so for once I can corral some thoughts together and post a comment within 48 hours of the discussion thread going up... hurrah!

So! The quickfire semi-resolution was a surprise (I was convinced this was going to split itself into a two-parter, right up until the clones got arbitrarily killed off *literally* seconds from the end), but I do like the way it left things. The Tree is confirmed to have some level of sapient self-defence; Chrysalis now knows where the Tree is even if she can't take the Elements out of it herself; the Mane 6 never worked out what was going on (or even that something more than standard Everfree dark magic shenanigans *was* going on), despite unwittingly meeting all 6 clones *and* Chrysalis during the episode.

Other than that, though.. oh, wow, I loved this *so* much. A loving tribute to The Return of Harmony, a dangerous gamble given that's one of the most beloved episodes in the whole history of the show, but for me, it worked. I mean, it *really* worked. I think they got it pretty much spot on, with every callback a worthwhile embellishment of the original; in particular, Rarity's even more extreme hoarding was just amazing (including Rainbow and AJ speculating on what was wrong with her, which is the kind of inspired script touch this show comes up with sometimes). Nothing can touch Liar Applejack's constant stream of utterly surreal bullshit (*127 Hours* reference was awesome, and ""badger art installation"" is already my default response to anyone asking ""what is this?""). And seeing the real Fluttershy being so utterly crushed after Jerk!Fluttershy poisoned the animals against her was genuinely hard to watch, without feeling like a cheap grab at the audience's heartstrings.

The ""new"" elements in the mix, the characters we never saw getting messed up by Discord all those years ago, were all home runs. Devious evil Twilight showing what a brilliant villain she could be (and her neuroticism calling back to Lesson Zero); Starlight just killing it again with her repeated awesome FML-face, her whole overladen packhorse bit, plus some amazing lines...

[](/rstarlightspittle ""I swear Kelly Sheridan's acting gets better and better with every episode) I should have just told you, I'll never love camping. (beat) Also... I'll never love camping. [](/sp)

...and of course seeing so much of Chrysalis, who seems to have lost her fucking mind at some point between the S6 finale and now if her ""dialogue"" with the trees is anything to go go by (is it the Everfree Forest that does it, or is she like Celestia and just can't cope with being alone?), getting increasingly impatient with being surrounded by disobedient morons... that, right there, that is the show I love.

Also, oh man, the way that the friends' conflict was resolved so easily was actually really heartening, because just as my kids were starting to shout at the Mane 7 for not realising how out of character the clones were acting to upset them, when Twilight punctured it all by just saying ""eh, it actually doesn't matter, because we all trust each other, we all know how to annoy each other, and we all know better than to let some petty nonsense mess us up. Now, let's go to the campsite""... rather than feeling rushed, it actually felt like a vindication of the past eight seasons, one of those moments where the show cashes in on the goodwill it's built up, feeling like The Return of Harmony could never happen again now because there is *literally* nothing Chrysalis or anyone else can do to split them all up for long, intentionally or otherwise.

Something I really want to talk about is the direction, because I never really see people talking about the direction in this show, and it was *spectacular* today. This was such a quickfire farce script, throwing a *lot* of gags at the viewer, that it could have very easily unravelled, but instead Big Jim and company just nailed it. The blocking, timing and reactions from every single character throughout this episode were some of the best I've ever seen in the show.

That pre-title sequence, with Chrysalis stealing the hairs and taking the photos, was a masterpiece - from the second she bursts through the door, there is literally not one wasted frame where something funny isn't happening away from the main focus (seriously, it's actually worth watching in slow motion). Fluttershy briefly having Pinkie's mane, Rarity's disbelieving scowl, Starlight's face when she's barged out of the way, Twilight's complete lack of tact, her and Rainbow's reactions to what's going on, the actual Polaroids themselves... Beautiful.

It's been a few days and so the excitement might not have properly worn off yet, but right now, this has to stand as one of my favourite epsiodes, not just of s8 but of all pony, full stop. How long is the hiatus? I want more of this. More!

1395,"It's easily my favorite horror franchise. I love Amityville like others love slasher flicks. My heart fluttered when I saw Amityville on the screen. I am working on getting any Amityville related movie, official or not, in my collection. 

Real life is very scary. Ofcourse the real horror started before the Lutz family waltzed in and that's what makes it so appealing. What brings someone to kill their family? Why were they face down? Why did no one hear gun shots? Did Dawn help? What was Ronnie's relationship with Dawn? Was Ronnie under a supernatural influence if such a thing exists?  Is he just a sociopathic liar?  Questions, questions, questions, and the list goes on. Then after all this mystery, uncertainty, and tragedy you have the Lutz family and their story (as dubious as it is).

I did not like the one with Reynolds, though it is sentimental to me as it's the first non documentary I saw on Amityville. I can't pinpoint why I don't like it, but it's definitely my least favorite.",2018-06-09 16:22:13

1397,"I ended up going for Them's Fightin' Herds. Tl;dr: literally Skullgirls with MvC3's controls. Besides the controls, everything in here reminds me of Skullgirls, including and especially the characters' personalities (all of them would fit right in Skullgirls). 

Luckily for me, I prefer MvC3's controls. Unluckily for me, this is still in beta and it's missing things a hopeless fighting game player like me needs, like specific character combo tutorials. Also, I don't mean to insult anyone at all, but the game is also kinda...ded. Youtube videos have ~500-1,000 views. I took a very quick glance around but didn't immediately find much in the way of character tutorials, which is always a worrying sign. I don't find random PvP in fighting games to be that fun, so I don't mind it much personally, but it's still unfortunate. That all said, I find myself more interested in this world than I did SG, and I find myself *wanting* to get better at it, so I might spend actual time in the old lab for the first time since UMvC3.

One of the best parts and the reason they made the game, of course, are the alt colors. The Trixie and Braixon ones in particular got me. It baffles me a little why Pom got so, so screwed in the alt colors department. It takes a full minute to spin around and appreciate Velvet's colors, but Pom has, like...half a dozen maybe? And none of them really stick out that much.

I've at least briefly played every character, and the one that sticks out to me is Orleander. From what I saw of Fighting is Magic ages ago, Twilight was the one I wanted to play the most, so I'm not surprised at all. I enjoy nothing if not fucking with opponents, and Orleander seems perfect for that. Pom, Fluttershy's equivalent, strikes me as insanely strong, but *good fucking luck* using her. I lied, I haven't tried Paprika yet. Pinkie was the second most one I wanted to try, but Paprika's design...doesn't do it for me. Arizona does what she does. Velvet's my second favorite. Tianhuo...more like Tianhu-no. I wasn't that interested in RD's style to begin with, and then they made her look like...that. Points for the Rapidash skin though.

I don't feel the least bit of regret supporting this game. It looks like they have monthly patches, which works for me. I foresee myself flipping out when I get to play the story mode, so hopefully I have a better handle on the game by then.

If you like Skullgirls, it's definitely worth keeping an eye on.",2018-06-09 16:29:09

One thing I've never quite figured out though, if someone got hit on the head and died, what did the ancient cultures think happened, if they thought the brain wasn't important?

[](/twiponder) Ooh, they played tense music the moment we saw that her holding up the pictures with her magic. Why? Is it because it's the first close-up shot of her magic, which is green? Did they really think we would be that saavy to this pony being a Changeling? It matches her coat; I would've probably felt the pony was malicious and not just zany but I doubt simply seeing a close up of her greeen magic would let me realize it was Chrysalis.

And if they expected the viewers to have seen the animatic then I wouldn't see how this would be the part people would realize if they'd forgotten either.

Wait is she at the edge of a forest? Huh, there's a forest just outside the Friendship school, isn't there? That's where AJ and RD took the school on a field trip? And... the school's right beside the castle, right? There's just this... forest? Between the castle and Ponyville? Or is it on the other side? The castle faces Ponyville, and the school is on the right from Ponyville's perspective, so from the shot we see here the forest is between Ponyville and the castle. Or I guess the forest could be to the left of Ponyville from the castle's perspective?

Wait who cares

Holy shit that remix of Chrysalis's leitmotif right after the intro... Hers certainly isn't the most memorable compared to Tirek, Discord, Sombra, or Pony of Shadows, but man that evoked the previous Chrysalis episodes well. 

[](/sp)

> Oh, and this

The way she skims over this makes me feel like it's very important; maybe it'll somehow be the spell's undoing. The Cutie Mark.

[](/sp)

Wait Chrysalis is now privy to the Elements. They attempted to get the Elements in A Canterlot Wedding, but were stopped by the massive number of Changelings inside the holding room. On reflection, it's likely she knew about the Elements; the density of Changelings inside the hall compared to just around Canterlot would make no sense if they didn't realize what exactly was in there.

> Which means you will be able to use them too

You see? I think the Cutie Mark she's burning is super important to the spell. If not for this detail I'd be calling BS and talking about how I'm concerned the show's been making the EoH from this seemingly sentient nearly-all-powerful artifacts attuned to good to just some super-weapons. Without some strange Cutie Mark magic shenanigans (Cutie Marks very obviously functioning like souls in various other stories), I doubt the EoH would attune to any random copy of the Bearers, especially malicious ones.

[](/sp) [](/sgpopcorn) Ooh! What if the Cutie Unmarking spell is what destroys these clones! Chrysalis's disregard and lack of respect for Starlight as she shows both in To Where and Back Again and in this episode's beginning causes her downfall.

Wait wtf why is Rainbow's hair multicolored? The way it looks she should just be growning different colored strands of hair, not having each strand change color. The lines on her hair should be going perpendicular if it were.

You know, I'm liking how Chrysalis has essentially been patched to catch up with the DLC.

Wait I mean...

Tirek was essentially Chrysalis+. Chrysalis was a Changeling. She could disguise as other ponies but was bad at acting, and she could slowly drain their magic over time to become stronger while her victims are left weakened. Then Tirek came along and he just had magic draining taken to 11. Sure, he can't disguise himself nor does he have an army, but that wasn't enough to counterbalance how ridiculously OP they made his magic draining. With the more recent episodes showing her actually knowing ancient spells and artifacts far beyond the natural Changeling abilities, she actually feels like a heavy hitter among the villains again. 

I'm going to stop commentating this live.

Okay wait I was just about to restart the episode and heard her say this

> Can you forgive me? I don't expect you to forgive me!

What if this is forshadowing how Chrysalis believes the ponies wouldn't actually forgive her for the evils she's done and that's why she didn't choose to surrender?

Wow also look at how Twilight just looks so pissed at her even when Starlight tries to be like ""no it's okay"" and only stops when she starts acting like a crazy bitch lmao

Gah I can't stop theorizing

What if Starlight uses the spell to create an 'evil' Starlight and it's just good


[](/sp) Okay I can't stop and I'm not going to stop.

Man love how these corrupted mane six have the same personalities as Discord's. Wonder if that's just supposed to be 'coincidence of creating opposite versions' or if there's some connection between Chrysalis's spell and Discord's magic.

Also, speaking of the spell itself, is this the new thing? The magic in the recent seasons feel more occult. I feel like every two or three seasons, there's been this theme with the magic.

I dunno why, I half expect Twilight to just betray and beat the shit out of Chrysalis.

Hm, at the least evil Applejack still seems to have the mind to fear Chrysalis. Most of them are just douches. Twilight I feel is the only one with the potential to do serious evil. 


Oh my god it's happening. Evil Twilight contradicted Chrysalis, giving her own orders. It starts off with 'suggestions', but soon...

Oh nevermind they just outright said it...

[](/sp)

Lmao Twilight's meeting with Pinkie was plot important, but then Rainbow just flipped Fluttershy off. This is the best.

I'm surprised evil Twilight didn't realize she was talking to real Pinkie.

I swear to god if they use this gag as an explanation for why Starlight can't fight back against Evil Mane Six I won't even be mad.

Actually now I'm kind of hoping evil Twilight's just way underestimating Chrysalis, who just eventually gives the fuck up and brutally destroys all of them

1421,"Been asking the same question for a while now . All I have found is a few ways:

1)[tensorflowlite only for image classification in android](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/tensorflow_lite)

2)[image classification app](https://github.com/AshKetchumza/waila) 

3)make your own API package for flutter  I guess 

",2018-06-09 18:53:46
1422,"I'd recommend Google's Flutter framework for something like this. In my opinion, it's a bit more approachable than native Android development and will allow you to have the application available for both Android and iOS without writing a line of Objective-C/Swift. 

I'm not sure what the best method would be for hosting/getting your images, but I imagine it could be setup pretty simply using Cloud Firestore. You would have to layout an upload schedule/method to make sure that accurate data is available when needed. 

Something like this could be thrown together in about a day by an experienced developer, but as others have said, there are a lot of concepts that you would have to wrap your head around before getting started if you have no previous programming experience. Even getting a development environment setup can be a bit challenging with Flutter if you do not have any previous experience or are not that tech savvy. 

Before jumping into Flutter/Dart, you'd want to become familiar with Object Oriented concepts, asynchronous vs synchronous operations, very basic data structures, packages/libraries, and maybe some design/layout concepts e.g. rendering a UI component, getting it placed where you want on the screen, setting attributes (size, color, font), and handling what happens when the user interacts with it (getting data from a textfield for storage/manipulation, navigating to another view/page, displaying a pop-up message, etc, etc.).

If you are interested in pursuing this as an option, I'd recommend [this](https://www.udemy.com/flutter-dart-the-complete-flutter-app-development-course/learn/v4/overview) tutorial. I think it's like $10 right now and covers basic programming concepts, setting up a Flutter/Dart programming environment (both MacOS and Windows), and moves on to cover most of the basics of the framework/language. One of the applications that he has you build along the way is actually a standard weather application that uses a free web API to receive real-time weather statuses for a specified location via JSON objects.",2018-06-09 18:56:32

[](/twishame)Like the evil Twilight. Loved her and the other asshole versions of the ponies.

But, Pinkie should be at a point where she knows Twilight pretty well. So if she would berate and yell at a demure, scared Fluttershy then red flags should be popping up in her head.

[](/ppshrug) It should be like that with the other scenarios as well. The girls should know each other better and therefore know when something isn't right. Instead of just chalking it up to ""Oh, the stress of keeping to a schedule"" or whatever.

I loved how Chrissy was basically a background threat essentially. And I think losing her hive caused her to snap mentally. Because why else would you trust an evil version of the smartest pony you know?

1434,"Every relationship you have but 1 is going to fail and most are going to fail substantially. 99% of them.  POOF smash boom gone.  

So get your head around that because its not going to change.  Its the same for everyone.  Its a game of failure, rejection, lessons and all the good stuff too, but this isn't a talk about the good stuff.

So I have been you and I get how you feel but you are just not finding the actual problem, and I certainly don't know what it is but maybe my shit can help your shit.

THIS IS ABOUT ME. So it might not match you exactly.  But abusers cheaters and the like is all I used to find.  So I had to look at it like this.

The only common denominator in all your failed relationships is you.  you pick the women, you date the women, you reject the women.  Its you who is making shit picks.  Not the womans fault for being shitty, its your fault for picking the shitty woman.  Shitty people can't help but be shitty.  Its why they are by definition shitty people.

So you are picking them.  Why?  

For me.  I have a HUGE thing for awful mean bitches for lack of a nice way to put it.  The shittier they are, the harder I swoon.  There are sparks, and connection and excitement and my heart flutters and all that shit that should be awesome.  Then they always turn out shitty.  Every single fucking one.  EVERY ONE.

So.  After a stream of shitty ladies and 1 failed marriage to a cheater it finally clicked.

Those ""fireworks"" that people get in movies and that normal people feel.  They feel for people who click with them.  When I get those ""Fireworks"" It means I am about to meet a real peice of work.

So I had to reject my ""type"" start from scratch and thats what I did.

Every date when I felt that ""Spark"" I was done.  Date over.

it was hard at first because what other indicators do you use?  That is what I learnt was the sign of awesome, but it kept biting me in the ass. 

So I changed what I was looking for, and I changed the requirements I had mentally in my head.   

Then things changed.

While I didn't get instant butterflies.  I was having dates with women.  Sans crazy, sans drama.  I was making friends with them and finding different kinds of sparks. Instead of going with my gut, I started using all the shit I learned from and about mean women, and started actually meeting quality people.

They didn't work out at first, due to the lack of sparks instantly that I always kind of expect, and it not being a good fit.  But I did't get cheated on.  We just parted ways and had a nice time together.

Then I met my wife, and just like the ones that were not crazy, I didn't look for instant butterflies.  I looked for the ones that came later when I learned how smart she was, and how funny she was.

It was way better, she is a wonderful person and my best friend and all that passion and spark that wasn't there instantly is there now in spades.

Like I said.  That might not match you at all.  But I can tell you from experience, you are picking the shitty women.  You are making a concious choice and there is a step in there that is wrong and you need to find it.

Probably a lot of rambling but I hope it helps.",2018-06-09 21:30:09

These first two episodes are definitely a lower quality than I recall from my initial watch. I think they're the worst in the show though, so hopefully anyone who remains in the rewatch is able to accept that it's uphill from here. As you may have guessed from the last couple minutes of today's episode, Akatsuki no Yona is a series that will focus on character development and interactions. As the cast expands, the show gets better and better. There are some cool action scenes here and there, but I would temper expectations on that front. 

On the topic of character development, showcasing the future is a neat way to display how much Yona will eventually change. For anyone who watches Boku no Hero Academia, you'll know that this technique is used in a similar fashion there. 

Compare the Yona we know to her future self. Throughout this episode she is extremely listless and has little to no reaction to anything due to the shock of seeing her father dead. Yona also holds no agency whatsoever. Things are happening *to* her, instead of her causing action. The journey to see Yona develop into a person who can stand tall in front of an army while notching and flying an arrow is definitely my favorite aspect of the series.

My parents were supposed 'soulmates' and I watched them argue every day of my life. Watched them waste their best years in front of the tv. Watched them grow old and useless. Watched them die.

Except.
Sometimes. I fly too close to the sun.
On our fourth date, she walks in the room and my breath catches in my throat. Strike one.
Her fingers brush against my arm and leave trails of liquid gold on my skin. Strike two.
Suddenly my laughter is flowing more easily and I lose track of time. Lose track of myself. She tells me she's never met anyone like me before and my heart flutters in my chest. Like Death itself is knocking on my rib cage. I know this feeling too well. I've watched it happen to countless people. I've seen what happens with their vitality gets stolen. I can't let it happen to me. Sometimes breaking it off isn't enough to squelch the flames, and I'm not about to take any risks.
I take her home. A few pills slipped into her wine is all it takes. I found this is the least messy way to take care of it. By midnight, she's gone, and I feel free again. Another bullet dodged. I should be more careful next time.
Saturday I'm hanging out with the Loveless group. One of the girls invited her friend from work, I don't remember her name, but she meshes with the rest of us like she's been here all along. I tell them about my last date and how I had to cut it off, omitting certain details. They can relate. We laugh. We share stories. This is what life is supposed to feel like. I have fun but I'm in control. I feel stable and comfortable.
Weeks pass and I learn the new girl's name. Kimbra. I'm glad she started hanging out with us. She gets along great with everyone. She tells jokes and parties harder than anyone I know. We stay out until the sun rises once or twice, even just sitting around talking is so fun with her. The weird thing is that I never really notice when she's there but I notice when she's gone. Somehow everything is a little more stale without her.
Months pass. One morning, I look at my hands. Something is off. They seem somehow, dryer than before? More rough? Maybe a trick of the light. Maybe I need to drink more water.
I told Kimbra about my hand problem. By now we've become close friends and I tell her pretty much everything without even thinking about it. She says she noticed the same thing about herself, and we laugh it off. Must be all those late nights we've been pulling recently. I'm glad to have a friend who can relate to all the strange little things in life.
A year passes. Somehow this past year feels like the shortest and longest year of my life at the same time. Like every other Saturday night, I head out to chill with Kimbra. This time, its her who had a date get a little too heated for comfort. Like I've done a hundred times before, I listen, I laugh. But I'm going through the motions. Inside, I feel a stab of pain. This is new. Completely unlike the feelings I've had with the other girls before, but somehow familiar. The thought crosses my mind that I feel like I've known Kimbra my entire life. Like an echo of something I can't quite make out, this thought, too, sounds like something I've heard before. That thought haunts me for the rest of the night. And the next night. My sleep become restless, until, suddenly it comes to me, clear like a bell. Where I've heard it. That's exactly what James said when he left us. He tried so hard to explain why he couldn't see us anymore. He sounded like a madman. And yet. Here I am, with his words resonating in my head. They're my words now. Line for line, everything he said now makes sense. I'm not ready. 
Later, I invite Kimbra over to my place. I make drinks, she has no idea that this night might be different than any other. Like always, we waste most of the time talking and laughing. I'm trying to hide the pain. I go into the kitchen alone, resolved to do what I need to do. This isn't what I want. I didn't ask for this. I take out my trusty pills and my hands shake above the lid. My throat closes up and my vision goes blurry. I must have stood like this for a few minutes because suddenly she's here with me. Her arms are around me and I feel the deepest peace I've ever felt.
I'm sorry, I tell her.
I know. She replies.
She tells me she's noticed we started aging. I share with her the thoughts I've been having, she admits to thinking the same. Maybe this is what life is supposed to feel like. Maybe a lifetime of peace and complete understanding with another person is better than a million wasted nights with shallow friends and nameless dates. Suddenly it all makes sense. I'm looking forward to a life well lived.",2018-06-09 23:36:53
1450,"[](/flutterroll) Considering what has happened during the past two seasons, **likely**. I'd be shocked if there are no more leaks, and **even more** shocked if there are no early releases.",2018-06-10 00:02:56
1451,"Some people chase after money. Other people chase after love. Still others chase after book, movies, hell, even writing. I couldnt even imagine: just sitting in front of your computer coming up with stories. Why do that when you could go out and make your own?

But all of them, yes even the writers, are looking for one thing: the elusive Rush. That feeling you get once a blue moon that makes you think, yeah, this is what I live for. Some people get it when getting that paycheck or driving at 300 miles per hour. 

I got the Rush by watching the light fade out of someones eyes. 

I looked in the mirror again. Red lipstick but not too red. I was playing Mary Sue  inexperienced, but eager. I wore a dark blue dress that fell down to my ankles with but an open back. Little eyeliner to accent my eyes, and my dark hair was pulled into a simple ponytail. The perfect Mary Sue. 

I blew a kiss to the mirror and went to see my date.

***

He was ten minutes late. 

He looked like his profile picture at least. Tall, he was around my height, tan skin and curly blond hair. He wore a button down shirt with rolled up sleeves and black pants. Time to play my part. 

Though I wanted to throttle him for being late I got up in a calculated movement, expertly knocking my chair back, like I was some flustered idiot, and stumbled.  

He was at my side immediately, helping me regain my balance. I fluttered my eyes at him. Oh, I-Im sorry, Im always clumsy. I used an old theater trick to make the blood rush to my cheeks, making him think I was blushing. 

Oh, um, its fine. In fact, I should be the one apologizing for being late, he said, looking like a kid whod gotten caught with his hand in the cookie jar. 

I laughed at the expression. Wow, that was actually kind of cute. So, um, should we sit?

***
He told me jokes and stories. I just blushed at first, giving me slight smiles, but then as I sipped at the wine I let myself open up, laugh a little more, casually brush my fingers against his. This one was devious. I could see the glint in his eyes now that wasnt there when hed help me from my stumble. The innocent face was a disguise. A damn good one at that, if it had fooled me, if only for a few minutes.

But I wasnt me, I was Mary Sue. So, I drank more wine and laughed harder at his jokes. I guess Id take him back to my kill house  his type would say yes, I was sure.   

I could probably overpower him, but he was well built and must have at least 50 pounds on me, Didnt hurt to be sure though I supposed. So when the food arrived, I made a show of digging in my purse for my phone and opened a case inside my purse and carefully picked up a single grain of the poison and crushed it between two of my fingers. 

I flashed him an embarrassed smile and squeezed his fingers  getting the colorless poison on his fingers. We were having wings, so no silverware involved  hed ingest the poison. It wouldnt kill him immediately, but it would begin working through his system, making him weak, easier to overpower. 

Another job well done. He opened both of our bottles of beer with his key chain bottle opener and we clinked our glasses. I took a swig of the drink. He put his drink down and bit into one of his wings. 

Both of us froze. 

That *bastard.* It was subtle, but it was there. Gloriella. It didnt really have a taste, but I could feel the powder warm on my tongue as I drank the beer. He was here to kill *me.* It wouldnt kill me immediately, I had a couple of hours to safely to take the antidote. He had frozen too, a bit comically, with his teeth half biting into the wing. He recognized the poison. 

I began to laugh.  

He shook his head and showed me his teeth. It was a smile of a predator. I matched his with one of my own and undid my hair, letting it fan across my back while he unbuttoned the top button of his shirt. Seemingly small gestures to any onlooker, but to professional killers it was like taking off a costume. Mary Sue was gone with her silly laughing and perpetual blush. 

He had changed too. Gone was the good boy look, and the more sinister side Id seen a shadow of dominated him now. He leaned back in his chair, wearing an expression of supreme confidence. 

Poison on the fingers eh? he said with a sardonic smile, not even bothering to keep his voice low. No one would hear us over the din of conversations all around us. 

I shrugged one shoulder in a casual gesture. Less clich than poisoning a girls drink at least. 

He rolled his eyes. Oh please, the classics are classics for a reason. If it works, it works.

Well, I said after taking another swig of the *poisoned* beer. It didnt. 

He blinked a few times at me drinking again, then a slow smile spread across his lips. A game. He dropped the wing entirely and very purposefully sucked the tips of his fingers clean, making sure to get all the poison Id gotten on them. 

You missed a spot, I said, and offered him my hand. 

My, my, arent we forward, he said, putting his hand on his chest in mock shock. But he then took my hand is other one and kissed my fingers. 

I raised my own beer in salute and drank the rest of it in one gulp. 

***

We were outside now, and he walked me to my car like a real gentleman. I had no idea where this was going really, but I was ready. I had a knife strapped to my thigh and a gun in my purse. I wasnt an idiot butI wanted to see where this was going.

We got to my car and I turned to him. Half his face was illuminated by the neon lights of the restraint sign, but I could see one half of his lips curve up in that trademark smile of his.  

He leaned forward and, after a moment, so did I. 

Our lips touched. 

We stood there, not kissing, but touching lips, exchanging the poison residue both of us had on our lips. It was stupid, borderline suicidal, but hell if it wasnt fun. He pulled back a shade before I did. 

My heart was beating wildly, threatening to jump out of my chest, and my cheeks were actually flushed. This was it, the Rush. And no one had died, or at least, not yet.

Sowill I see you again? he asked.

I grinned.

1452,"Haggard  was a fat giant of a man. He towered over his students at nine 9feet tall. Hermione watched in awe as he guided his students  into the magical creature pen just outside his wooden hut.  

""Right, ladies! T'day we're gunna lern aboot Brarhead Hoonds! Tern to page 69 of yer textbooks!""  

There was a flutter of paper  as students opened their books.  A Japanese girl to Hermione's right raised her hand.  

""P-Professor? Do you mean, Braehead Hounds?"" 

""Aye, chinky,"" Haggard replied, ""Thas what I said - Brarhead Hoonds.""

There was a pause  as Haggard opened the gate. Two excited Braehead Hounds leapt and barked.

""Ahh need two 2volunteers!"" Haggard boomed.  

He scratched his beard and looked at the class before suddenly pointing at Hermione. 

""Whoremione! You'll do! And I need one more... Oy! Slanty eyes! You're up as well! Get in the pen!"" 

Hermione and the Japanese  girl stood up and stepped into the Braehead Hounds'  pen.

""Now, girls. These are magical creechurs. Yeh have to be be very careful because these are horny dogs! I'm gunna teach yeh how to handle them safely!""

Haggard then closed the gate and locked it shut.  

*Ring ring*    

""Aww shit, that's mah phone.  I'll be back faster than Congress  can impeach Trump.""    

Haggard wandered off, leaving the girls locked inside the wooden fence with the Hounds while the class watched.  Suddenly the Braehead Hounds  began to walk towards the girls!

""G-good d-doggy..."" the Japanese  girl whimpered, stepping back and raising open palms.   

Suddenly, one of the Hounds  leapt at her, knocking her onto her back. She landed on the ground, her schoolgirl skirt lifting up to reveal her panties. Hermione watched as the Japanese  girl's arms sank into the muddy earth.  She struggled to stand back up - but her arms were completely stuck! 

The Braehead Hound  wasted no time ploughing its snout  between her yellow thighs. It's sharp teeth quickly found her cotton panties and chewed them off, exposing her virgin pussy to the entire class!

""N-Noooo!"" she screamed.

Hermione panicked as the second Hound turned to face her. In a frantic flurry she made a dash  for the wooden fence. There was a small crack between the planks - maybe enough for Hermione to squeeze through. She could hear the Hound chasing her!

""Ah! Dammit!"" Hermione cried.

She had tried to dive through the gap, but she had only managed to get her upper half through the hole. She was stuck waist down in the pen. No matter how she struggled and wriggled, the little witch couldn't break free.

She frantically searched for her wand,  grabbing it from her cloak's pocket. As she lifted the magical stick to cast a spell it was snatched from her hand! 

""Sorry, does this belong to you, Whoremione?"" Muffloy jeered.

The Slither-in student had stolen her only defence against the Hound.

""Give that back!"" Hermione yelled.

""No, I think the class would rather watch what happens next, you filthy mudblood."" 

The Japanese  girl's arms were still stuck in the thick muddy soil. The Braehead Hound  had buried its head between her thighs now. Its long, wet  tongue  was repeatedly caressing her virgin slit, lapping up her teenage juices. 

""Ah! Ah! Ahhh! St-stooohhhhp! Ayaaaaahhhhhh!""

The Hound slurped and slobbered    at her cunt, its hot tongue  driving her  with unwanted pleasure. Her little clitoris  was burning with each graze of the beast's  talented muscle.  

""Oh!!! Ohhhhh! I'm cuuummmmmiing!"" she screamed, her body convulsing. 

She shook and thrashed near-uncontrollably. The unwanted orgasm rocked her body to its core. But the Hound  wasn't finished yet - it continued licking  even after she had finished.

""W-Wait! Ahhh! T-too sensitive!!!! Ooooohhhh! Ahhhhhhhh!!!""

Hermione was not having much luck  either. The second Hound had placed its paws upon her back in an attempt to mount her. It's hard, eight 8inch shaft was already pressing up against her tight vulva  through her panties. It thrust forward as hard as it could, but the elastic panties refused to yield. 

""Oh! Ah! Bad dog! Ah!"" Hermione gasped.

She struggled to break free and keep her composure in front of her class. If she could only last until Haggard came back...

*rrrrriiiipppp*

""AHHHHHHH!""

Hermione's panties suddenly snapped and eight inches of doggy dick plunged into her soaking wet pussy.   

She felt it fill up her body, stretching her cunt with its thick cock. Almost immediately it began to thrust in and out at an inhumanly quick pace. 

""Ah! Ah! Ah!"" 

Her moans came fast. Too fast. She could barely catch her breath.  She curled her toes  as the pleasure spread like a plague  throughout her body. With each thrust her big breasts   swung back and forth.

She clenched her hands  and banged her fists  against the fence. Her efforts were fruitless though - she was well and truly stuck.

The Japanese  student had cum four 4times now. Her little mind was going blank as the hound's  unceasing tongue  never stopped licking.

""Aaaahhh! Oh yes!! Yesss!!! I'm a little doggy slut!!! Lick  my pussy  !"" she hollered, another orgasm washing through her body.

Hermione felt something thick begin to swell within her pussy.  

""Oh look,"" Muffloy laughed, ""it's knotting Whoremione!""

The swelling pushed up and stretched her pussy, placing an immense pressure upon her quivering g-spot. This was enough to drive  her over the edge.

""Oh! Oh fuck! I'm cummming! Nooooooohhhhhhh!!!""

Hermione's body betrayed her as she came. Seconds later she heard the Hound howl.

""Arroooooo!""

""No! Don't cum inside me!""

Hermione knew that many of the magical creatures in Haggard's class could impregnate girls. Right now was a very dangerous time of the month for her!

She felt a hot, goopy fluid rush into the depths of her pussy  and flood into her fertile womb. The sensation was enough to send a second orgasm through her teenage body. Already, the Hound's sperm were swimming towards her teenage eggs , seeking to fertilise them. As the Braehead Hound  continued to cum, the cum began to leak  out of her pussy  and trickle down her thighs.

""Hahaha!"" the class roared in laughter at the two girls' plight. 

""Looks like Whoremione is going to be a pregnant slut now!"" Muffloy jeered, egging the crowd on.

""N-noooooo! Get me out of the fence! I- ahhh- I need to get the cum out! Ooooh!""

After five minutes of pumping her pussy  full of cum,  the Hound finally released her, leaving her lower half drenched in thick white semen.  The Japanese  girl wasn't faring any better. The Hound  had finally left her alone - but she was still quivering on the ground in the aftershock of twelve 12consecutive orgasms.

Haggard returned four hours later - long enough for the Hounds to fuck the Japanese  girl, and for Hermione's tight little ass  to get flooded with doggy cum too.



""Oh bugger,"" mumbled Haggard, ""I've already hit mah allowed limit of eight impregnated students this month. The school nurse is gunna kill  me...""",2018-06-10 00:35:45

""No! Don't cum inside me!""

Hermione knew that many of the magical creatures in Haggard's class could impregnate girls. Right now was a very dangerous time of the month for her!

She felt a hot, goopy fluid rush into the depths of her pussy  and flood into her fertile womb. The sensation was enough to send a second orgasm through her teenage body. Already, the Hound's sperm were swimming towards her teenage eggs , seeking to fertilise them. As the Braehead Hound  continued to cum, the cum began to leak  out of her pussy  and trickle down her thighs.

""Hahaha!"" the class roared in laughter at the two girls' plight. 

""Looks like Whoremione is going to be a pregnant slut now!"" Muffloy jeered, egging the crowd on.

""N-noooooo! Get me out of the fence! I- ahhh- I need to get the cum out! Ooooh!""

After five minutes of pumping her pussy  full of cum,  the Hound finally released her, leaving her lower half drenched in thick white semen.  The Japanese  girl wasn't faring any better. The Hound  had finally left her alone - but she was still quivering on the ground in the aftershock of twelve 12consecutive orgasms.

Haggard returned four hours later - long enough for the Hounds to fuck the Japanese  girl, and for Hermione's tight little ass  to get flooded with doggy cum too.



""Oh bugger,"" mumbled Haggard, ""I've already hit mah allowed limit of eight impregnated students this month. The school nurse is gunna kill  me...""",2018-06-10 00:36:25
1455,"Haggard  was a fat giant of a man. He towered over his students at nine 9feet tall. Hermione watched in awe as he guided his students  into the magical creature pen just outside his wooden hut.  

""Right, ladies! T'day we're gunna lern aboot Brarhead Hoonds! Tern to page 69 of yer textbooks!""  

There was a flutter of paper  as students opened their books.  A Japanese girl to Hermione's right raised her hand.  

""P-Professor? Do you mean, Braehead Hounds?"" 

""Aye, chinky,"" Haggard replied, ""Thas what I said - Brarhead Hoonds.""

There was a pause  as Haggard opened the gate. Two excited Braehead Hounds leapt and barked.

""Ahh need two 2volunteers!"" Haggard boomed.  

He scratched his beard and looked at the class before suddenly pointing at Hermione. 

""Whoremione! You'll do! And I need one more... Oy! Slanty eyes! You're up as well! Get in the pen!"" 

Hermione and the Japanese  girl stood up and stepped into the Braehead Hounds'  pen.

""Now, girls. These are magical creechurs. Yeh have to be be very careful because these are horny dogs! I'm gunna teach yeh how to handle them safely!""

Haggard then closed the gate and locked it shut.  

*Ring ring*    

""Aww shit, that's mah phone.  I'll be back faster than Congress  can impeach Trump.""    

Haggard wandered off, leaving the girls locked inside the wooden fence with the Hounds while the class watched.  Suddenly the Braehead Hounds  began to walk towards the girls!

""G-good d-doggy..."" the Japanese  girl whimpered, stepping back and raising open palms.   

Suddenly, one of the Hounds  leapt at her, knocking her onto her back. She landed on the ground, her schoolgirl skirt lifting up to reveal her panties. Hermione watched as the Japanese  girl's arms sank into the muddy earth.  She struggled to stand back up - but her arms were completely stuck! 

The Braehead Hound  wasted no time ploughing its snout  between her yellow thighs. It's sharp teeth quickly found her cotton panties and chewed them off, exposing her virgin pussy to the entire class!

""N-Noooo!"" she screamed.

Hermione panicked as the second Hound turned to face her. In a frantic flurry she made a dash  for the wooden fence. There was a small crack between the planks - maybe enough for Hermione to squeeze through. She could hear the Hound chasing her!

""Ah! Dammit!"" Hermione cried.

She had tried to dive through the gap, but she had only managed to get her upper half through the hole. She was stuck waist down in the pen. No matter how she struggled and wriggled, the little witch couldn't break free.

She frantically searched for her wand,  grabbing it from her cloak's pocket. As she lifted the magical stick to cast a spell it was snatched from her hand! 

""Sorry, does this belong to you, Whoremione?"" Muffloy jeered.

The Slither-in student had stolen her only defence against the Hound.

""Give that back!"" Hermione yelled.

""No, I think the class would rather watch what happens next, you filthy mudblood."" 

The Japanese  girl's arms were still stuck in the thick muddy soil. The Braehead Hound  had buried its head between her thighs now. Its long, wet  tongue  was repeatedly caressing her virgin slit, lapping up her teenage juices. 

""Ah! Ah! Ahhh! St-stooohhhhp! Ayaaaaahhhhhh!""

The Hound slurped and slobbered    at her cunt, its hot tongue  driving her  with unwanted pleasure. Her little clitoris  was burning with each graze of the beast's  talented muscle.  

""Oh!!! Ohhhhh! I'm cuuummmmmiing!"" she screamed, her body convulsing. 

She shook and thrashed near-uncontrollably. The unwanted orgasm rocked her body to its core. But the Hound  wasn't finished yet - it continued licking  even after she had finished.

""W-Wait! Ahhh! T-too sensitive!!!! Ooooohhhh! Ahhhhhhhh!!!""

Hermione was not having much luck  either. The second Hound had placed its paws upon her back in an attempt to mount her. It's hard, eight 8inch shaft was already pressing up against her tight vulva  through her panties. It thrust forward as hard as it could, but the elastic panties refused to yield. 

""Oh! Ah! Bad dog! Ah!"" Hermione gasped.

She struggled to break free and keep her composure in front of her class. If she could only last until Haggard came back...

*rrrrriiiipppp*

""AHHHHHHH!""

Hermione's panties suddenly snapped and eight inches of doggy dick plunged into her soaking wet pussy.   

She felt it fill up her body, stretching her cunt with its thick cock. Almost immediately it began to thrust in and out at an inhumanly quick pace. 

""Ah! Ah! Ah!"" 

Her moans came fast. Too fast. She could barely catch her breath.  She curled her toes  as the pleasure spread like a plague  throughout her body. With each thrust her big breasts   swung back and forth.

She clenched her hands  and banged her fists  against the fence. Her efforts were fruitless though - she was well and truly stuck.

The Japanese  student had cum four 4times now. Her little mind was going blank as the hound's  unceasing tongue  never stopped licking.

""Aaaahhh! Oh yes!! Yesss!!! I'm a little doggy slut!!! Lick  my pussy  !"" she hollered, another orgasm washing through her body.

Hermione felt something thick begin to swell within her pussy.  

""Oh look,"" Muffloy laughed, ""it's knotting Whoremione!""

The swelling pushed up and stretched her pussy, placing an immense pressure upon her quivering g-spot. This was enough to drive  her over the edge.

""Oh! Oh fuck! I'm cummming! Nooooooohhhhhhh!!!""

Hermione's body betrayed her as she came. Seconds later she heard the Hound howl.

""No! Don't cum inside me!""

1465,"Bid Now Continued - (Page 2 of 3?)

> Did you notice any impact on your waistline, weight, or complexion after WOBO?

As mentioned, I like to do n=1 experiments so that I feel more confident posting about some of these issues.  In April, I had ""experimented"" up to 198 pounds, and then did a seven day fast, Standard keto, a four day protein shake Protein Sparing Modified Fast, Standard keto, ending at, you guessed it, 198 pounds.  My weight was 198/189/198/191/198 so I knew what to expect.  I ended the WOBO at 190.6, or down 7.4 pounds.  Unfortunately, I know very well how to add that back overnight should I wish.

Likewise, my stomach measurement goes up and down as well, and I dropped 1.625"" over the seven days, or 1.75"" compared to my April starting measurement.  My head circumference, knee circumference and my arm-chest measurement all went down, which is a good indicator of perhaps lower water retention and inflammation for me.

I'll guess that was 7+ pounds of water as I expected.

> Did WOBO bring about any changes in sleep, mood, energy levels, or gastro/inflammatory/autoimmune conditions? 

I felt a bit more achy upon waking.  Sleep was about the same, except at Day 5 discussed below.  I noticed no change in my mood, as I am always a damn pleasant guy, however my anxiety seemed to increase a bit around Day 5.

> Please discuss any other changes worth mentioning (grocery costs, ketones, NSVs, cravings) 

I checked my blood glucose and blood ketones daily because it was an experiment after all.  These are all second thing in the morning readings:

Day 0 - 85 BG, 1.3 Ketones - 7:30 a.m.
Day 1 - 78 BG, 2.1 Ketones - 6:30 a.m.
Day 2 - 70 BG, 1.5 Ketones - 7:30 a.m.
Day 3 - 75 BG, 3.1 Ketones - 7:00 a.m.
Day 4 - 76 BG, 1.9 Ketones - 8:30 a.m.
Day 5 - 70 BG, 2.1 Ketones - 8:30 a.m.
Day 6 - 87 BG, 2.7 Ketones - 4:45 a.m.
Day 7 - 96 BG, 2.0 Ketones - 5:30 a.m.

Any /r/Losit posters want to compare?
 
I did not sleep well after Day 5 and I attribute the higher BG level to waking earlier and the Dawn Effect or anxiety.

> Did you use salt? 

No, and I was somewhat concerned about this.  I had two instances of postural hypotension (low blood pressure) and felt a bit woozy.  I recognized the feeling and continued on even without salt.  I had some muscle flutters in my calves three or four times and drank some water and that seemed good enough.  I did no strenuous exercise this week.

> Other than salt, what spice/seasonings did you use?

I used no spices or artificial sweeteners at all.

> Were any of the days of the 7 noticeably harder/easier than others? 

My anxiety seemed to increase around Day 5.

> How does WOBO compare to the hardest & easiest dietary challenges you've faced in your life? 

Since I am well experienced with fasting, this was no problem.  

> Did anyone join you for a nothing-but-ground-beef meal at any point?  Ha .. 

> Isn't WOBO really boring? 

Yes.  I was considering buying a dog food bowl to serve it up by the end of the week.",2018-06-10 01:54:35

1467,"Someone posted about this last year and it seems like it's not an inside thing, the government just looks at the numbers.

I removed the dates and removed 1/2 my jobs.  Some ask when you graduated from college, which should be illegal.

I hear about react native and Flutter and others, but seems that ObjC and Swift are still the popular ones.  I live in the commute zone to Silicon Valley and we had a company just on the edge of what most would consider the commute zone.  They were all ObjC for years, then Swift, then C# about the time Microsoft bought that Xamarin.  They ran ads for jobs using Xamarin for months, over and over again.  Then after about a year, they ran tons and tons of Swift ads.  They were hiring anyone even willing to learn Swift.

The reality of the market place for languages is that there is a balance.  A company might want language X, but that doesn't mean that a programmer is will to bet their career on that language.

I was at a company during the DotCom era that was code locked with something that was outdated by many years and they wouldn't pay the priced to move to a different platform.  It was DOS based and offered no real Windows solution.  Another one was using Pascal, Delphi and the number of people willing to commit career suicide was pretty small.

At the one company, we tried for about 2 years to get anyone even willing to learn parts of the language, no good takers.  All we got were people that couldn't even open a file on a server.

I left, others left and they were finally forced to hire TONS of programmers to do everything over from scratch.

It's not just one side, programmers don't want to be tied to a sinking ship.  Even Swift got a pretty big push back, but Apple open sourced it and pushed pretty hard to make it stick.

Apple also has a history of not allowing certain types of apps, and they are one of the big players.",2018-06-10 02:00:43

1470,"Possibly Depression, or the beginning stages of it. Possibly just normal for you.

One important thing many people seem to forget, is that you are not supposed to be happy all the time. Most of the time, you are likely to be neutral in feeling/emotion. Only when something nice happens will you feel happy/excited. Like seeing a random butterfly flutter past you. Or sad when you see something sad, mad when something annoys you, etc.

So I suppose you have to try to see if the empty feelings are simply you being neutral and not feeling anything in particular, or true emptiness in that 'something is wrong' empty.

Also, procrastination can make you feel like nothing is getting done, and it's true, but not because of Depression like some might think.

Or it could be.

It's really hard to tell with these kinds of things, and only you can really know for sure if something is wrong that needs to be looked at/fixed, or if it's just normal stuff we all do. Like putting off working out, and then feeling bad that you aren't losing weight.

1488,"As a point of information, SVT is a class of arrhythmias, of which afib and aflutter are two.

I'm not an EKG expert, not a cardiologist and certainly not an electrophysiologist. That looks to me like a rhythm with fast, short waves that I'd hesitate to call P or T waves. They look like fibrillatory waves, but with higher amplitude than I'd expect (although that depends on axis, which we don't know). And those are irregular QRS complexes, sometimes tachy and sometimes brady. That sounds like atrial fibrillation, except afib is classically a fast arrhythmia, and there are sometimes several seconds between beats there, which would probably produce low blood pressure and, yes, you would feel woozy and maybe pass out. So afib with heart block? Escape rhythm?

I do think it's SVT of some kind, but I'm not confident of the kind. And cardioversion \+/\- beta blockade makes sense, although it sounds funny to beta\-block symptomatic bradycardia.",2018-06-10 04:31:34

1504,"Jason glanced at the two guards laughing at something suspiciously but as the iron bars of the portcullis started moving he quickly forgot about them. They didn't matter. He was only here for one reason really. Only one person.

He jumped off his horse, giving the reins to a stableboy and his helmet to one of the Massey guards who'd come with him. His pure white cloak fluttered behind him in the soft spring breeze as he made his way over to the gathering of Faines. Just like them, Jason was wearing full plate, an expensive-looking silver-and-gold coloured suit with an engraved triple spiral on the back of each gauntlet as well as prominently on his chest piece. Bits of mud dirtied the polished boots, but Jason didn't seem to mind.

He spread his arms wide as if to hug the entire family and grinned. ''It's good to finally be back among people I know. Tris, Evelyn and little Lucifer are all so busy with their royal tasks, and the other nobles at court are so incredibly plain and boring. It was fun for a while, but I longed to return home to Massey's Hook.'' He quickly glanced at each of the Faines, his gaze lingering on Kerena for just a little longer then the others.The hint of a small, teasing smile lingered around his lips before he returned to Myles.

''What's all this then, eh?'' He pointed at all the commotion around them. ''It's like you're preparing for war. You do know the Laughing Storm is dead, right? Got himself stabbed by an Uller last I heard. All the singers in King's Landing were very fond of telling me that part. As for the King himself, he told me publicly that he'd consider my request of Baratheon land, and promised our House would be reimbursed for it's efforts, then I never heard anything from him again. Personally I find it insulting, but I know Father won't share my view.'' Jason shrugged. That was a problem for later, when he returned to Stonedance.

1519,"Many have come to see Eberron, the world sage, and seek his wisdom. Some come seeking help, after their lives have devolved so far into despair they see no other path to salvation. The world sage is known as a healer of what is broken. Others come in search of advice, seeking a way to know the future, to gain some great victory or success. The world sage is known as one who can see beyond mortal sight. And some come, like the visitor today, to usurp the world sage, to find the secrets to his magic and wrest them from his grasp. Today's visitor was one of those.

*A young mage, much like I was, once,* thought Eberron as he watched the young mage warily, trying to anticipate how this one would try to steal his secrets. 

The mage began his formal request, ""Great sage, I came today to ask a favor. Will you\-"" 

Eberron noticed a slight pressure around his left temple. It was clever of the young mage not to reveal his intentions. Eberron had had many challengers. Most in the days of his youth, but still one or two each year, hoping desperately to gain his extraordinary abilities. He had destroyed them all. This one would be no different.

Eberron raised a hand, and fire began to gather on his outstretched palm. ""You have thirty seconds to explain yourself before you are annihilated. Why did you attempt to gain access to my mind?""

The young mage ran. Bolting out of the caverns that the world sage called his home and back to wherever he called home. Eberron could have killed him as he ran, of course, but it was better of other people also saw the result of trying to unseat him. Humming to himself, the world sage opened a scrying spell and focused in on the young mage. The mage had begun a transport spell. After about fifteen seconds, the mage disappeared from the grassy area outside the caverns and appeared in the University.

That was interesting. The university hadn't sent a challenger in years. This one must have gone alone then, hoping beyond hope that he would be able to defeat the world sage, and move up in the university. Eberron felt a bit of sympathy for the young mage, but mercy once is a thousand challengers later, and one death was better than many. So Eberron cast his spell. A three dimensional image of the world sage appeared inside the university. The image put out a hand, straight in front of itself, and fire began to gather on it. The mage frantically began to look for a way out of the room he was in, but he found all the doors locked and the image impervious to any kind of attack, until, in a blast of flame, the mage was incinerated, and the image of the world sage disappeared.

Eberron, back in his cavern, just shook his head sadly, and, today's work complete, went to sleep. 

He dreamed of younger days, and greener pastures.

*Many years ago*

Sid and Mary, best friends since they had both begun to study at the university, were discussing the merits of the various names that they could choose when they graduated.

""I think I would be a Meredith, or a Morgana,"" Mary said decisively.

Sid decided not to point out that this was about the seventh time Mary had changed her opinion, and based on the laws of experimental probability, she would probably do so again about every two hours.

""I'm sticking with Eberron"" It had been Sid's favorite mage name ever since he had found it once in an old spellbook that had been misplaced in the library. Eberron's Guide to Magery. He was going to read it, but before he could, a librarian had rushed over to him and pulled the book out of his hands, scolding him for stealing a book from the ""Graduated Mage only shelf."" He hadn't, of course, but that didn't seem to matter to the librarian, who gave him a week's detention. He had never quite forgiven her for that.

""So boring,"" Mary complained as the two walked together to their first classes of the day, ""Why don't you ever change it up?""

""I just like the name."" Sid turned off into a different hallway, where he had class, while Mary continued straight.

""See ya Sid!""

""Bye Mary""

As he walked the remaining distance to class, Sid remembered something with a start. It was presentation day! Today, he would need to present some work of magic to the royal family. He had been preparing for a while, but he was still a bit nervous. What is he messed up? What if the royals didn't like him?  
As he walked into class the teacher looked up from her book. ""Sid. Fantastic. Well class, now that our last student is here, we can go see the royalty.""

Five minutes of walking and hushed conversation about their projects with the other members of their class, the students arrived in the amphitheater. The royal family was already seated, all together in the guest box. After a short introductory speech, the teacher introduced the first student. 

""Benjamin, will you come present your project please.""

Benjamin slowly walked to the center of the amphitheater, bowed to the royal family, and began to draw symbols in the air with his birchwood staff. He finished about a minute later and Sid was mildly but pleasantly surprised to realize that he could understand the basic shape of the spell, and what was going to happen. It was actually a fairly complex piece of magic, but unless Sid had completely misunderstood the runes, Ben was going to turn himself invisible. This he did, and after about thirty seconds he reappeared and bowed again, taking a seat and enjoying the applause he recieved. What followed was fifteen minutes of Sid being far to nervous to truly appreciate what any of the other students had done, up until the teacher called his name. Sid, heart pounding and stomach fluttering with something so much larger than a butterfly, it could be considered a dragon, walked down to the stage and bowed for the appropriate time. Then, he began his preparations. After about a minute of drawing runes, he requested to borrow one of the royal's cups of water. The prince offered him his, and Sid caused the water to levitate out of the cup and towards the runes Sid had drawn. His plan was to transform the water into butterflies, and then back again. It was a feat of magic much more complex than anything the other students had done, as transformation was one of the most difficult magics. Sid levitated the water onto the first rune, and, in a flash of light, the water transformed into, not butterflies, but a swarm of rats, which attacked the royal family. It turned out that rats were the Queen's greatest fear, and the terrified monarch screamed and jumped out of her seat, trying to run from the oncoming rodents. In the process, one of her high heeled shoes was flung from her foot and flew directly into the king's face.

The king shouted, ""Bring me that mage!""

Sid ran.

He didn't even know where he was running until he found himself, terrified and out of breath, in the library's restricted section. Maybe there was a book here that could help. Sid found himself drawn towards one particular book, Eberron's Guide to Magery. He opened it, hoping desperately to find some way to escape. Instead he found a warning: ""You who would open this book, BEWARE. It holds dark secrets, demonic creatures, and dread magic within its pages. You have been warned""

Sid, reasoning that dread magic is better than being dead, opened the book to the next page. It contained a spell the likes of which Sid had never seen before in his life, labeled ""For use in emergency ONLY"". Knowing he had only seconds to spare, Sid read the words there, and then realized, too late, what they were. An invitation. He felt something slide from the book into his mind, and a cold, demonic voice spoke in his head, ""Hello Eberron. I think we're going to get along quite well.""",2018-06-10 11:19:28

&nbsp;

I am not

Not what? A slave? You are, Ahriman. Every beat of your blood, and every conjured thought in your skull, serves the Changer of Ways.

You speak

From the first moment you saw the stars in the sky you served the God of Change. Every beat of your life has happened for its amusement.

I am no ones slave, and no ones son!

It burns, does it not? laughed the daemon. Truth, ignorance, power, there are no things deeper, no things darker, no fires more fierce. You are a slave. Your choices are not your own, no matter what you may believe. I offer you freedom, Ahriman. Take Ctesiass place in my debt, and the chains will fall. Its voice was low, crooning, like a mother offering comfort to a child. No other can promise you this. No other has broken those chains themselves. I alone am the salvation you crave.

The tableau of battle was dissolving, and the daemons presence was a suffocating coil of pressure squeezing tighter, anticipation and hunger seeping from it like heat from a fire. I could feel Ahrimans presence then, the hard crystal of his mind resisting the slow strangling. He was strong, but if I had been able to speak I would have told him that he was not strong enough.

This is a trap, breathed Ahriman. You never wanted Ctesias. You knew I would come for him, and so you sent the daemon hounds to kill him. You have been waiting for Ctesias to fail, so that you could engineer this moment. You are here for me.

The great intellect revealed at last. The gods will fall, and the warp will howl at the foot of my throne. You may join me in that future, Ahriman. It can be yours.

No.

Then you will lose what you came to save.

Needle points of ice pierced me and ripped downwards, and the daemons anger and spite was roaring through my blind soul like a wind of knives. And then I heard something that terrified me more than the pain of my torment.

Ahriman laughed.

So certain, he said, and there was no humour in his voice. Only iron. So used to power. So much a slave yourself that you cannot see that your delusions are the amusements of the gods you rebel against. I could feel the daemons anger and confusion. And so certain of your power that you forget your nature and limits. You have lingered here too long *Belakor*. And while this is a trap, it is not yours.

No! roared Belakor.

Cracks of white and blue light split my sight, blinding me, pulling me down. Belakor howled and blackness howled with it. I was coming apart. I was shreds of thought separating under a blade. I was a single, long shriek of agony.

And then colour and sound and feeling rushed in, and I had an instant of numb disbelief before I began to drown in my own blood.

Chanting voices poured into my ears. Flame light spiralled around and above me. I could see a ring of figures in blue armour and white robes. Their hands were raised, fingers linked by chains of lightning. I was lying on my back, blood pulsing from the wounds in my chest and neck, pink foam frothing as I gasped. Ahriman stood above me, his horned helm a crown of brilliant light, his open hand splayed above my eyes. His voice echoed as he called I call you from the shadow of this soul, Belakor.

Darkness vomited from my lips. The spaces between the lights dimmed. A black cloud swelled through the air, caged by the fire and lightning.

I call you into the light!

The shadow cloud twisted, searching for a way out. Shapes formed within it, sketches in shades of midnight.

I call you!

The cloud rushed outwards, and then snapped back into something that had shape, something less and more real than smoke. And at last I saw Belakor. I had never seen him before. He was many things at once, images and forms overlaid and combined, all the same and all separate: a withered skeleton with twisted horns of rotting bone, a towering creature of bare flesh and red flame, a figure of flowing obsidian muscle, a shadow like the flutter of great wings. He loomed larger than sight, his presence ice and cold oblivion.

You will burn, sorcerer! roared Belakor. I will make your dreams ashes!

I have an offer for you, daemon. Ahriman sounded utterly unconcerned. A trade.

I will drag your soul through the garden of knives. I will stew it in the pools of decay, and burn it on the fires of wrath.

Control is made of knowing what we have, and want we want. Power is having something that someone else wants and cannot have. I make you a simple offer. You release Ctesias from your debt, you heal his wounds, and you grant me the answer to one question. For this I will give you freedom.

You dare

If you do not accept this, I will bind you into Ctesiass corpse, and bury that corpse beneath stone, and fire, and leave it there until the stars turn cold.

You do not have the strength.

I do. It might cost, but what does not have a price?

Through the haze of blood and fading life, I saw Belakor, the First Prince of Chaos and Master of Shadow, shake with rage, and then become still.

I it hissed. I accept your terms.

You submit to release my brother Ctesias from all bonds made between you, to return him to life, to give me the answering of one question I will speak to you?

I do.

Pledge it!

By the hidden marks of my name, by all the power that is mine, by the fortune of all that I will bring to being, I answer and am bound by your gift.

Good now make it so.

The daemon twisted, its substance spiralling into a column of fire and black smoke. I felt my heart beat a last time, and felt thousands of invisible hands grip my flesh and begin to pull me down. And with the last scrap of life I heard Ahriman speak his question to the daemon, and I heard Belakor laugh as he answered, and then I felt the memory of both question and answer vanish as the blackness finally took me.",2018-06-10 12:46:00

1529,"Solid advice: pressure > boost, or alternatively: ABP (Always Be Pressuring); most situations this will apply, but dropping back for the 100 boost is fine if it looks like a long clear from the opposition and you have no part in the current phase of pressure - the key part of that is positioning to receive their long clear, rather than the boost, but when you do so, spare a second thought for your team mates and see how they're rotating back - if they look low on boost (most probable), leave the 100 for them (if you can) or at least don't gobble up the small ones as well.  This pathing is critical in a game of such minor factors making large differences, most players have their routes for collecting small boosts down pat, but the paths to avoid these small pads, to leave them for your team mates, is just as important.

A step before this though is boost management: I often see team mates and opposition 'fluttering' their boost for no reason, when not part of that phase of play - it's probably sub-conscious, they're focused and on edge, using that little bit of extra boost to 'move around' and 'position', but if you minimise this, then releasing pressure to rotate out for boost becomes less pressing.",2018-06-10 13:09:11

1532,"It wasn't bad, but I had mixed thoughts on a few things and it could have been better.

The characters seemed somewhat off, especially Chrysalis. Chrysalis seemed to be more cartoony/corny villainy than what we've seen of her before. I got this vibe when she was monologuing her exposition dump when creating the Mean 6, and when she kept tolerating the antics of the more corny Mean 6. She was fine when dealing with Mean Twilight though.

Talking about Mean Twilight, she was good....the other Mean 6 weren't nearly as good though. They seemed worse than Discord's version of them. Again, it seemed like they were pushed too far into cartoony/corny villainy.

Oddly enough I found Mean Fluttershy hilarious when she was ~~bullying~~ motivating the bird to help itself back into it's nest. Unintended comedy I suppose, maybe it was the animation of the bird being shoved and crawling up the tree that was visually funny.
Kind of weird though when the actual Fluttershy got pinned with the blame, it wasn't amusing but rather flat. I assume the mistaken identity segments were suppose to be played amusingly, like Fluttershy asking what just happened with Mean RD flying off.

I didn't mind the Mean 6 and Mane 7 never ending up in an actual direct confrontation; although I felt the Mean 6 was wasted when they were written out at the end. What would have made an much more interesting ending is if the Mean 6 were less cartoony villains like Mean Twilight, rebelled against Chrysalis, and won. Say the Mean 6 learned to work together at the end just like the Mane 7, overpowered Chrysalis, she flees, and unbeknownst to the Mane 7 the Mean 6 were out there somewhere running amuck. Maybe this could have even set up for Chrysalis being reform, she would have to work with the Mane 7 to defeat the Mean 6. Instead this episode didn't seem to setup much new, other than reminding us Chrysalis is still out there plotting (which we already knew), and maybe the Tree of Harmony is corrupted now.

Overall okay, but a little disappointing.

> Bakermat, an alias for young dutch producer Lodewijk Fluttert, had a quick rise. In just three months he gained a lot of views, likes and followers with his productions. He always had an obsession with music, in many genres. The young Bakermat was into jazz and blues and discovered house music when he was around 12. By fanatically listening to every track that was posted on blogspots he soon had a huge library built up. At the age of 18, he went to the University of Utrecht to study Psychology and to finally live on his own with other students. It was Utrecht that made him discover deep house and producing.

> He started practising a lot with production and deejaying and quickly developed a sound of his own. His sound, deep house with jazz and soul influences, started to get a lot of attention in this short time. He went from being an ordinary student with no musical network at all to a producer with labels and agencies knocking on his door. In september Bakermat singed a contract with agency Soulmax, knowing that they will bring him to the next level.

> His sets are filled with joy and happines, and always melodic. Saxophones, flutes, trumpets, Bakermat tries to use them a lot because its the combination of these jazz instruments with deep house music that make Bakermats style unique. Still growing as an artist, Bakermat had a release in August on Delicieuse Records where he released the Vandaag EP consisting of the tracks Vandaag and Zomer (DM mix). Some other tracks that are received succesfully are Uitzicht, Black Cat John Brown and Strandfeest. He is currently working on productions with other artists as well like Arjuna Schiks, Tonique etc. A lot of work in progress is ready to be released and the gigs are lined up, growth is what matters!

1540,"I chew my lip for a moment as the thoughts of last night come fluttering back into my mind through the few hours of sleep I managed between now and then.

And I sigh as I take notice of the massiveness of your bulge in your tight little boyshorts. Christ. If its that impressive when its so very flaccid and concealed, I cant even imagine how intimidating it has to be when its hard and bare for all the world to see.

Im not sure if its the memories of the audio show I got last night, the sight of your admittedly delicious-looking bulge, or the way you so shamelessly inhale the scent of last nights contestant on the *Holy Shit, Its Huge Show, Starring You,* but my own pint-sized prick begins to inflate within my panties beneath my comforter. I try to make the way I lay my hands over the spot where my little hard-on would be look casual.

N-No. No. I mean, I heard a little. But no, I was fine. I quickly answer, glancing away as I try my hardest to both not stare at your bulging softie and steal as many glances as I can.

You smirk as you turn to face me fully, dropping the neon-hued underwear back down onto my laptop as you take a step towards me. I silently grit my teeth at the rude gesture and feel my cheeks begin to flush as I come eye-to-eye with your the outline of your clearly growing member in your undies.

Just heard? Didnt *see?* You purr down at my bed-sitting, erection-hiding form with a little giggle. A taunting giggle. A giggle that would through me and not at me if it had eyes to look with. Your next words are infuriatingly smug, since we both know that you already know the answer to your query.

Want to? See it, I mean?

Your voice is like velvet as you gently jut your hips forward at me and cross your arms over your chest. I hesitate only for a moment.

I reach forward and hook my fingers underneath your waistband before glancing up at you and raising an eyebrow while subconsciously adjusting to sit on the edge of my bed. My little 2-inch stiffie must be obvious at my panties.

Dont fucking tell anybody, though. My voice is stern, and a bit impatient. I make myself say the words, even though Id rather just be pulling your dick out.

You sling back with a chuckle.

About that cute little Tic-Tac youre hiding downstairs? Got it, all hush-hush.

I exhale through my nose and glare up at you for a second before rolling my eyes and gingerly shucking down your boyshirts to your mid-thigh and gasping softly as your fat semi flops free and into view.

Its gorgeous. Recently shaved, judging by the lack of hair or stubble upon your pubic mound. Lengthy, at least 8 or 9 inches as it becomes fully turgid, but with a meaty thickness to match. And a juicy-looking pink mushroom tip. A few nicely distinctive veins, too.

Overall, definitely worthy of the cliche that I accidentally let crawl from between my lips as my orbs flick up at you.

Holy shit, its fucking **huge.**",2018-06-10 14:14:05
1541,"She loved him? He loved her. She needed him? He needed her. She wanted him? He wanted her.

Coming into her apartment after a long day of work, she deflated with every step, taking off her coat and slipping out of her high heels. In the lounge, she dropped into the armchair, sinking deep into the cushions. Head muddled, full of fluff, her eyes fluttered closed as she fell into a not-quite sleep, on the precipice.

He crept through from the kitchen with a smile on his lips. A floorboard creaked underfoot.

Hello?

He stilled while she remained unsettled, and then resumed his careful walking when the tension left her. Step by step, he closed in until close enough to reach out and squeeze her shoulders.

Rather than surprised by the sudden touch, she didnt react. But, she smiled?",2018-06-10 14:16:00

1544,"Before Jenny was famous for reviewing Star Wars, she was popular in the Brony community for her parody show she created with her friend Griffin Lewis. The show was called Friendship is Witchcraft, and it was considered the best MLP abridged series by the majority of the fandom. Each episode of Friendship is Witchcraft was a retelling of the original episode it was based on with the characters changed a little. Twilight Sparkle was a power hungry narcissist, Rainbow Dash was a blind idiot who said Rainbow and Dash like a Pokmon, Rarity and Applejack were both veterans in some unnamed war in the past. Rarity was left with ptsd from the war, and Applejack was an apparent war criminal who had never been prosecuted. Fluttershy was an insane cult leader who wanted to bring back lord smooze, and Pinkie Pie was a traumatized orphan who tried to bring back her parents with gypsy magic. Jenny voiced nearly all the characters except for Celestia and Discord who were voiced by Griffin and a few minor guest voices. When the last episode was too elaborate to edit out of existing episodes, Jenny and Griffin did a live reading at a brony convention. The full show can be found here

Her eyebrows fluttered as she turned to Rodrik and smiled, a nervous one at that as a strange feeling lingered within.

""Thank.. thank you, Rodrik."" Her fingers ran against her arms to try and warm her, ""It is rather cold."" 

She spoke as she felt him warming towards her, closer than before. Was it too early to place herself against him? What would her father think? She did not know.

A cold pale hand with slender fingers placed against Rodrik's cheek for a moment as she felt the fibres of his cheek. In a few years, he may have a beard but now it was as clean as Royce's bottom. As he continued to talk, she merely listened, keeping her hand close to him.

Cold grey orbs widened with the last line of his speech as they trailed before the cold snow.

What I'm saying is with all  the stuff they've endured, and been through together that there should be a level of self-awareness if any of them act ""out of character"" so to speak.

1557,"No offense taken at all. I was drawn to your post for the same reason, it's just fascinating to see the other side of things. Yes, it is absolutely exhausting to be so emotional. I am personally a very logical person at the core, and so often emotions are just irrational, and that becomes a tough thing to accept. I can see the situation, know in my head that it's okay, but still cry. Or meet a new friend with whom I click and then my heart starts fluttering and I imagine what life would be like with them. I think the most exhausting part is that tug and pull from my logical side of my brain and the emotional side. 

I connect very strongly to most songs. No matter the song, just because I have felt the whole spectrum of emotions at some point. But definitely more so to the more poetic songs. Love to me actually feels stronger than is often portrayed in songs or movies. If that makes any sense at all, because it really doesn't to me. lol. I definitely see how ridiculous a lot of that can seem. But for instance, I was with my ex for 6 years and we would always say that we felt our connection was stronger than anybody had ever experienced before. Pretty naive, but it felt that way. Like nobody else could have possibly found a love like that because the world would be a different place if this love existed in any common form. That crying during separation is very real to me. I attach myself on to a person so I feel if they are gone a piece of me is too. It's very difficult for me to feel whole while alone. That is what I hate most about BPD. I hate having to constantly rely on another person all the time. It leaves me extremely vulnerable and easily manipulated. 

I personally have not ever cried during a movie. I am actually the same way, I see those people and those stories for what they are...just stories. I think maybe because I do feel real emotions so strongly, I can spot the fake ones. However, if I watch a show like America's Got Talent, I will bawl my eyes out watching those people pursue their dreams because it's like I can feel that excitement swelling up inside of them. I actually also prefer documentaries over most other forms of television. The lack of emotion in them is often calming to me, because like you guessed, it really is exhausting. 

It's tough to tell if someone is manipulating you while they are crying. That is certainly a common way people manipulate others in relationships, but it could also be very real. I think that if you feel you are somewhat immune to being manipulated, maybe you could trust their emotions as real? That way if they are real, they feel validated but if they aren't real, you can't be manipulated any way, so no harm no foul.

What have relationships been like for you in the past? Do you feel differently towards a person you're dating than you would towards a friend? I know you mentioned it briefly in your original post, but I'm just curious about it. I really wonder what a ""normal"" relationship is like between two people without mental illnesses. Maybe somewhere in the middle of nothing and everything. Right now I am starting a relationship with a guy I suspect might have psychopathic tendencies as well and it is a very odd combination when we try to do anything relationship like. So far we have been able to balance each other out pretty well but I'm definitely curious where the limits of the relationship lay. ",2018-06-10 16:24:30

1559,"> **Shock Corridor (D. Samuel Fuller, 1963) [65/100]**

Right on the cusp of a three-star rating as I frequently found myself fluttering on the spectrum of my liking of this film, my first venture into the work of Samuel Fuller. A veteran of World War II, having landed in Normandy, Sicily, and Normandy, Fuller trades the horror of war for the horror of psychopathy by sending his main character, a fair-minded journalist pridefully seeking the Pulitzer, into the bowels of a mental asylum where he has tasked himself with routing out the killer of a patient by questioning three patients.

As an easy companion piece to *One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest*, a similar film where a sane man embeds himself into a mental asylum, Shock Corridor touches on an array of contemporarily topical themes: racism, mental illness, the psychiatric system, communism, post-war anxieties (the bomb, specifically) and post-traumatic stress disorder. Quite a medley of topics for Fuller to tackle in a relatively slim runtime, and although he touches upon every one to some degree, their widespread, thin breadth in the film more makes them systematic concepts to dissect rather than taking a microscopic look at them with authentic depth.

In fact, the film would probably work better as a theatrical performance, a five-act play, given how the narrative is so clearly broken up into acts: the planning, the first witness, the second witness, the third witness, the fearful consequences. Striking camerawork with a great opening shot: the camera sequentially and slowly pulls out to introduce character after character in a small room that in the beginning seemed to be populated by only two.

Not sure on Fuller's handling of Johnny's descent into madness; his fits seemingly come out of nowhere, and though you can discern most outbursts to be him putting on a performance, once the final fade-out arrives, I cannot believe his degeneration is at all as convincing as Fuller intended  instead it plays off as the writer-director wanting to make an artificial point at the expense of organic characterization/storytelling.

A slew of noteworthy players: Constance Towers as Johnny's reluctant girlfriend/accomplice tears up the screen in the opening scene; and the supporting roles of Larry Tucker's Pagliacci (a self-proclaimed opera singer who supposedly murdered his wife while singing), Hari Rhodes' Trent (a black man who believes himself a member of the Klan), and Gene Evans' Boden (an atomic scientist with a Nobel prize who has regressed to the mentality of a young boy).

Despite the thinned themes, some editing peculiarities (odd cuts that seem more like nonessential cheat cuts), loud (sometimes literally), messages, and Johnny's feeble characterization, *Shock Corridor* is a bold piece of work that surely provoked mid-century audiences even though that provocation today seems more cartoonish than efficacious.

> **Trainspotting (D. Danny Boyle, 1996) [70/100]**

Came to be reminded of Terry Gilliam's *Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas*, a similarly told tale about drug addiction wherein the camera and mise-en-scne transmogrifies, entreating the audience with psychedelic imagery that one may envision during a heroine-induced high. But whereas Gilliam injects comedy into Hunter S. Thompson's narcotized journey through the Nevada desert and the Vegas oasis, director Danny Boyle instead administers harsh turmoil into the lives of the film's characters; an assemblage of young adults  still living with their parents  as they dizzily stumble from high to high. The height of this cinematographic form comes in with Renton's withdrawal, a protracted sequence midway through the film where he hallucinates a baby crawling on the ceiling toward him, the room having become impossibly elongated much in the same way the walls do in Wonka's factory (another fever dream, drug-injected film with its own hefty supply of bamboozled visuals  one in the film surely a nod to the milk bar in *A Clockwork Orange*), and his psychotic friend sharing his space under the sheets of his sweat-soaked bed until he quickly disappears into thin air, leaving Renton behind only in the company of his yearning wails and convulsing body. Wide angle lens are used frequently, effectively creating a visual manifestation of doped discombobulation. Director Danny Boyle has always had a penchant for loud cinema, his taking to formalism very much heightened and subsisting in much of his filmography. Here, in an early work of his, he is seen pushing the boundaries in small ways. In homage to Pynchon's *Gravity's Rainbow*, Renton, early in the film, drags himself into the bowels of a (disgustingly dirty) toilet. The film then cuts to Renton swimming in a massive pool, a deep blue all around him. A small taste for the abstractions to come. Aside from Boyle's drugged filmmaking, he also saves room for complete devastation when a toddler's corpse, dehydrated and starved and neglected by junkies, is shown lying dead in the crib, the camera staying still to look upon the malnourished, all-too-young face. The apex of pathos is achieved here, yet the film, in one manner of imperfection, never quite reaches for more catastrophe. Sure, scenes of violence and the parting of friends come (not to mention a scene very much imitating *Once Upon a Time in America* by way of a man betraying his friends for a load of cash), but the film more or less stays flatlined in emotional intercourse. Plus, as is with Guy Ritchie's equivalently bombastic ensemble of characters in his own films, Boyle's like set of characters are slightly marred by the fact their characters' quirks are louder than their personalities, leaving me never really attaching myself to any of the players. However, as much as Trainspotting doesn't shy away from the nastiness of drug addiction (looking to the literal 'shitstorm' scene for example), the group of players here are  alongside Boyle's formal direction and John Hodge's propulsive script  well-crafted enough to warrant much praise. A fine picture.",2018-06-10 16:33:45

1563,"That is such bullshit. Like the other user said, that rule has been made for selective news only. I am sure you must be one of the 'just' mods or probably a naive mod of the sub, but the fact of the matter is that you have other moderators ( namely fluttershy_qtest for once) who keep on abusing their power to control the narrative just because they happen to have some different political inclination. She/he does this by banning users while giving fake reasons like 'brigading' and 'hate mongering' and removing comments that don't violate any rules. But then again, I guess SJWs get offended by everything and don't look for logic.

There was a **LOCAL CRIME **  story about a young girl being raped in India. But since the  victim was from a minority (muslim) community, it served the agenda of hatemongering against the big bad majority aka Hindus or/and the democratically elected right wing party and thus was kept at the top of the world news where it gained tons of upvotes. Any attempts of reason or counter argument  was taken as hate mongering and user was banned.

Now the sub attracts various trolls in itself. My alt is banned from the sub ( by fluttershy_qtest ) because I asked another redditor who was getting abused by troll spewing lies to not get angry and respond to 'paki trolls' . I was then banned for 2 reasons. 

1. Using slur paki.

2. Assuming user was from Pakistan 

I however did not know that paki was a slur, so I politely apologised and asked to be unbanned. Then I mentioned how the user himself has claimed he is from Karachi so I did not assume anything. I was never unbanned and my highly upvoted comment was removed. I was then told 'we don't want filth from other subs here'. 

So when you say bullshit like 'one of our oldest rules' it grinds my gears. Either you make new rules or don't complain and remove posts when users find a 'loophole'  because you chose to be selective earlier.

1566,"I have two stories.

The first being the time I destroyed a Target bathroom. I had the day off and it was a beautiful summer day. There was a Sonic in the same parking lot as Target so I decided to get a cold drink to take with me as I shopped for things I didn't really need. I went through the drive thru and got a small hot fudge shake. It tasted so good I drank it before I even made it to Target.

So I mosey into the Target with the intention of going to Electronics, which is at the back of the store. Important note: this location only had one bathroom and it was at the front of the store. As soon as I set foot into the Electronics department, my stomach rumbles and my asshole quivers. This isn't going to be good, I thought. I take off speed walking through the store and barely make into the bathroom to unleash a hot lava lake into a poor, unsuspecting Target toilet. The other people in the bathroom were subjected to the exorcism of RunicSquirrel05's bowels. It smelled like death to the point that I was nauseous just smelling my own stench.

Second story:

I went to visit my friend in a large city about 2.5 hours south. We ate delicious food for 3 days and walked it all off visiting various shops and hanging out.

Our last stop before I drove home was a Mexican restaurant where you filled out a slip to tell them what you wanted on your tacos and any sides. I got a side of rice and beans and two tacos. One taco was chicken with a mild salsa and the other was a slow roasted steak taco with their second hottest sauce. We also spilt a basket of chips and queso and I had one small peach margarita (truth be told it was a very weak, but delicious margarita).

We go back to his place, hang out for a bit and then I decide to make the drive home. About an hour into my drive my stomach started to hurt. I had stopped at a gas station in a small town for gas a cigarettes. I was a little hesitant to use the bathroom because I'm sort of androgynous looking and have had people make ""wrong bathroom"" comments to me in my own city. I didn't want a confrontation at a small town has station at 9:30 at night. So I pulled a feat of mind over matter and forgot about the ominous rumbling of my stomach.

Another hour into the drive my stomach started to kill and I could literally feel my bowels churning. At this point I had roughly half an hour left in my drive and I was on the interstate in the middle of nowhere. No gas stations or stores for miles. Once again I mentally muscled past the foreboding feelings of my intestines.

Half an hour goes by and I make it home. The rumbling and churning by and large forgotten. Until I stood up to get out of the car. A sharp pain emerged in my stomach. It felt like I had been stabbed. Then my asshole fluttered and it felt like hot lava once again.

I ran inside my house, leaving behind my bags I had packed and dodging my cats lest they be caught in a shit river. I make it to the toilet, so sure that relief will come quick.

I was wrong. This shit was not what I was used to. I was used to eating spicy food and for liquid shit within a few hours. Nope. I had all the spicy food pains, but somehow I was nearly constipated. I pushed and I pushed but nothing happened. My stomach felt like there was a bag of rocks made out of lead just resting inside.

This continued on for at least 10 minutes, but it could've been longer. I was in so much pain that I could not even comprehend the passing of time. I even propped my feet up to get a better angle and then nothing happened.

I waited, and I waited and finally. The turd came out. At first slowly, and then all at once. The whole time it felt like I was going to die between the pain in my stomach and the pain in my ass. It was a completely clean wipe, as well.

I flushed the toilet and it clogged. I had to plunge it even though I was almost too weak to stand. I then crawled straight into bed and passed out.",2018-06-10 17:31:07

If so I'd love to hear your perspective specifically on that issue, but if not, I'd really prefer not to have those women's experiences trivialized from an outsider to make somebody else's point.

There are a *ton* of fraught gender issues in the female bodybuilding and strength communities as a result of steroids.  Bodybuilding keeps adding rules to require female bodybuilders to *reduce their muscle mass*, or adding categories for women to compete at less muscular sizes like figure or bikini, but then the largest women in those categories fare better than others, forcing pressure to use steroids or lose.  Almost since the inception of women's bodybuilding, there has been great debate on whether women should even be allowed to compete on the basis of muscular size, and if they should be judged based on the goal of being big and strong or on their ability to conform to ideal female bodily expectations.  There's the ridiculous sparkly bikinis and enormous heels, the huge hair, breast implants, the expectation of highly performed femininity to counteract the perceived masculinity of being a woman with big muscles.

Jennifer and Connor had an average marriage. It had it's ups and downs like most relationships. They still loved each other very much, but it was becoming more and more rare for either of them to stoke the fire. On a lovely summer day Connor decided he'd try something new.

Jennifer wouldn't be home until after six so he had time to set the stage. In the back yard Connor had laid down a blanket and readied a bottle of champagne. Jennifer was always partial to the combination of the colors red and black, so Connor ringed the blanket in candles of those colors. He then scattered rose petals. A bit much perhaps, but he believed Jennifer would appreciate the effort. A blue tooth speaker was at the ready to softly play some of their favorite music.

When Connor heard the car pull in to the driveway he rushed outside with the champagne to light the candles and turn on the music. With the candles lit and the champagne poured Connor hit play and readied himself, nervous with anticipation.

Something was off. The bluetooth must have been on the fritz. It sounded oddly garbled. The wind picked up suddenly and the candle flames fluttered chaoticly but didn't go out. Thunder boomed in the distance.

Figures. Connor said as he hopped up to save the items from what he assumed was an impending storm.

As he stepped out of the circle an arch of lightning came crashing down into the center of the circle of candles setting the blanket on fire.

Holy shit! Connor yelped as he hopped backwards and fell to the ground.

Hello man. A buxom figure with skin so white it was almost trasnlucent hovered in the smoke billowing from the blanket. Her black hair flowed about her as though she was underwater. Embers for eyes crackled with delight and dark red lips pulled tight into a menacing grin.

Connor scrambled away as the demon chuckled at his fright.

Why so scared my pet? My appearance was clearly intended. The candles arranged perfectly at the proper time. A bottle of the monks' mistake, petals of the lust flower, and discordant music. It's been so long since anyone has gotten it all correct.

I didn't mean,.. Connor was at a loss. He had totally forgotten about his wife as the back door swung open. He and the demon turned quickly to see an irate woman standing in the door.

What the fuck Connor? Jennifer seethed.

Oh, hello Jennifer. The demon's eyes narrowed and the grin vanished.

Maz'riel. Jennifer growled.

Connor hadn't been expecting any of this, but his wife knowing the name of an unintentionally summoned demon cut through his fear.

1575,"Cycle: NTNP 17 cycles (in 26 months), TTC 1 cycle

Ovulation cycle day: probably CD34 but could have been CD37, my temps are weird and CM was kind of inconclusive.

Relevant BD: If I ovulated on CD34, then O-4 and O-1. If CD37, then O-4, O, and O+2. We were kind of burnt out from lots of sex the week prior when I kept getting high fertility digital OPKs for like 10 straight days, and I thought I just wasn't even going to ovulate, so we were doing it for fun, not ""business""..

Tracking method/apps: I had been tracking cycles/CM with Kindara the past couple years since coming off BCP. Switched to FF this month because I wanted to start temping etc and didn't like Kindara's userface. I went all out this month- oral temps, digital OPK, analog OPK, the works.. and it just confused the hell out of me.

Symptom spotting: obsessively!! I have irregular cycles ranging from 30-50 days. My nipples usually get a little sore 7-10d before my period, but they got SUPER sore about 4-5DPO this time, which was unusual. I had noticeable heartburn which I rarely ever get, let alone multiple days in a row. A couple instances of slightly bleeding gums when I brushed my teeth. Otherwise, just a general heavy feeling in my abdomen and a funny fluttery feeling up inside my vagina- like my cervix was quivering or twitching on and off throughout the TWW.

Day of positive tests: now THIS is the craziest part!!! I started testing at 9DPO and kept getting stark white BFNs. The morning of 13DPO I had an 8am OBGYN appt for a ""preconception consult"" to evaluate my irregular periods and see if it was PCOS, anovulation, hormonal issues, whatever, just so we could address the issue before spending a year trying. She did some bloodwork and I asked for a beta while she was at it, just out of curiosity, although my FRER was completely negative that morning. Results came back negative- hCG of 1.3. That SAME night, sad and kind of frustrated and with one FRER left, I said screw it and peed on the stick. FAINT BFP. I almost fell over and died. My husband, who is an ER doctor, said that it was a false positive because physically impossible for me to be pregnant with a beta of 1.3. But I must have literally implanted DURING THE DAY because the next morning the line was darker, and even darker that night. Called the doctor who was shocked but skeptical and told me to come in the next morning for a repeat. Lo and behold, hCG of 25.7 at 15dpo, 48 hours after I was at 1.3. They're having me repeat next week just to be sure everything's okay, but my lines are darkening, so I feel like it might be the real deal!

Supplements and medications: OLLY prenatal gummies

Birth control history: On and off the pill through and after college. I was on the lowest possible dose (lo-loestrin) due to some side effects. After my wedding, I went off the pill to give myself time to ""regulate"" before TTC and thank god I did. It took me almost 5 months to get my period after stopping (151 days).

Typical cycle length: irregular but usually between 30-50 days.

Health conditions/medical tests: never diagnosed with anything reproductive-wise but I was concerned about PCOS. The bloodwork my doctor did on 13DPO showed normal testosterone, prolactin, DHEA, LH and TSH though, so I'm still not sure of the cause. I have mild-moderate anxiety but have never been medicated.

Content wise, I mostly like your stories. I'm particularly fond of the early few as they were quite deconstructive. They come of as typical men controlling women's bodies, but by the end, the women were in control either the whole time or have gained full autonomy. I'd like to see more of that because it seems to have fluttered away as you continued writing. And then, this is more personal, I just want to see more AE/Butt expansion.

""But,"" you say, ""my instructor always told me never to operate the engine oversquare."" Get a new instructor. Either your present instructor does not understand the situation, or he/she is insulting your intelligence by giving you an overly restrictive rule of thumb with no basis in fact. You can brush off the overquare warning with this wisecrack: If it is really so dangerous to be oversquare, why don't engines blow up when the plane is parked on the ramp? After all, there they sit with 30"" MP and zero RPM! And how about all the turbocharged engines that fly happily to TBO cruising at 34"" MP and 2300 RPM, or the little Skyhawks that do 10,000 takeoffs between overhauls using 28"" MP and 2400 RPM? And what is ""square"" about this square anyway? A square's height is equal to its base, in what sense is 24 inches of mercury equal to 2400 revolution per minute? These numbers live in different dimensions. If we measured MP in psi and engine rotation speed in rotations per second, the same power setting would be about 12 psi and 40 RPS. You will search in vain through internal combustion engine theory books looking for discussions of ""oversquare"" conditions. This wives' tale in the pilot clan seems to have been repeated often enough to have gained some respectability, but it has no basis in fact.

Having said this, I must point out that there definitely are limits to the extent to which you can go ""oversquare."" As MP rises, so does BMEP. And when BMEP goes up, so do the pressures and temperatures in the cylinder--and this will push the engine closer to its detonation limits. But when the manufacturer set up the RPM/MP envelope, detonation was definitely being considered, and you can safely operate anywhere inside the envelope, including oversquare settings.

Actually being too far ""undersquare"" is more damaging. In this case the pistons race back and forth in the cylinders, undergoing huge acceleration and deceleration loads, without the cushioning effect of compression pressures. For this reason, if you need to expedite your descent, it is much better to reduce RPM to the bottom of the green arc with the MP well above idle than to leave the prop at its cruise RPM and reduce MP to idle. Continental puts a warning on this subject in its Owner's Manuals: ""CAUTION...Rapid descents at a high RPM and idle manifold pressure setting are to be avoided.""

In fact there are a lot of advantages to running your engine at the lowest RPM that will provide the desired power. (i) Friction losses are minimized, and this means greater engine efficiency. (ii) Propeller efficiency is generally greater at low RPM, so more of your BHP and fuel burn is converted to useful thrust. (iii) The volumetric efficiency of the engine is greater. (iv) The tack time adds up slower. If you and I cruise side by side for years, you using 2400 RPM and me using 2200 RPM (and more MP), you will have an airplane with 2400 total time on the tach, while mine will show 2200 hours.

1593,"This is the flight before my first solo, I was on finals in my soon to be solo plane (PA38 ZK-TAW), with severe turbulence that was being read as 10knots up to 10knots down (pretty much immediately) on the VSI. There was also a cross wind which was roughly 12 knots. As I was flaring for the landing after kicking rudder to line up straight with the runway, we hit 10knots down VSI and slammed into the runway from about 25 ft AGL. The sound of the nose wheel exceeding full compression was so loud I though we crashed or that the propeller hit the runway (grass strip in NZ, Matamata). I taxied back to that aircraft parking bay and myself and my instructor hopped out to have a look, no damage at all! The aircraft was grounded for 24hrs so that we could check for stress signs or any latent damage. Then the next day after 24 hrs I flew solo in the same plane. 

Another time was in another PA38 ZK-TDL. I was doing solo conciliation flights from Kapiti airport (NZ) and after takeoff turning into cross wind leg I looked at the wings and they fluttering. Both of them. It wasn't an optical illusion, they were both fluttering. So instead of carrying out circuits I landed immediately, taxied back in and told the flight school. They checked and found warp marks along the wings. I later found out that the trim cables for the elevators had snapped. 

Gotta love PA38's!!",2018-06-10 20:12:21

1595,"""Meet up tonight. There was an accident,"" the letter said, signed God with a neat, tight script at the end of the scrap of paper. I tossed it out the window of the car, swearing. Stupidly, I had taken my eyes off the road to read it, and I had to swerve to miss a family of ducks and some kid chasing after a basketball. The letter fluttered and vanished down a gutter. I saw it in the side-view mirror. 

So when I went inside and took off my jacket, I was not expecting that same letter, with the same creases and same torn edge, sitting in my jacket pocket all snug. I opened it and read it, just to make sure, and the words were exactly the same. ""Meet up tonight,"" God said. ""There was an accident,"" God said. 

I wasn't sure I liked God that much. After I got fired for the third time, the idea had began to settle in my mind, and after skateboarders keyed my car for no reason I knew with certainty: God was a dick. I tore up the paper, then tore up the scraps again and again until it was confetti, then tossed them in the trash. Whoever was sending these was *not* funny. If it really was God, and since this was the fifth note I'd received it  was looking a little likely, I didn't want to speak with Him. He could go and stay behind His pearly gates, perching on his stupid throne while his stupid angels played their harps or whatever. He could wait. In all His infinite glory, he could manage to spare an hour or so. 

The phone rang. Thinking of the job I applied for, the one I was *hopefully* qualified to do, I crossed over to the kitchen, where the phone sat on the counter, and picked up. 

""Hello?"" 

""This is God."" The voice was purity. It was deeper than any voice I'd ever heard before, and smooth and warm like honeyed sunlight. 

I hung up. ""I'm serious,"" the voice from the phone said, completely ignoring what I had just done. *That decided it,* I thought. *God is real. Phone's don't do that.* 

There was only one thing I could say. ""What do you want,"" I demanded, crossing my arms even though there was nobody to see. It came out sounding like a command. ""Look, you're God, right?"" 

""That is true,"" the voice said. I unplugged the phone, just to be sure. The voice continued mid-pull, unaffected. 

""Then you're the reason my life is so -- so shit. You're the reason my parents died in that crash. You're the reason I can't get a goddamn job.""

There was a pause from the being using my phone. ""That is true,"" the voice said, following a brief sigh. 

I echoed the sigh. I stared at the phone, unplugged with that impossible voice emerging from the speakers. ""I'm going crazy, aren't I?"" The voice started to speak. I cut it off. ""Shut up. Fine, where should I meet?""

The voice went silent after that. I picked up the phone, looked for caller ID, found none, and slammed back on its cradle. I paced around the house, swearing and sweating and rubbing at my face (doubtlessly no good for my pimply skin) but nothing supernatural happened. Not for the first time, I wondered if this was all a hallucignation; if I was truly going crazy, like my grandma and my grandpa and my sister. The craziness ran in the family. I wouldn't be surprised if some day I ended up rocking in some padded room, babbling about aliens or gods or alien gods. 

Eventually, I got tired, and I went to sleep. All doubt was gone that night, because God appeared in my dream. 

I knew it was Him. I don't know why, I don't know how -- I just knew. Perhaps it was the ethereal light radiating from His robed form. Perhaps it was the chorus playing from all around me. Perhaps it was the clouds and angels and golden throne. 

""God,"" I said. 

""Yes.""

""You're underwhelming."" It was true. He looked like a guy of ambiguous age or race. In fact, he kind of looked like one of my neighbors. 

""My true form would burn your eyes from your skull,"" he said. The angels, which were pretty men and women with massive white dove wings, nodded. I felt a little disappointed in the whole thing. God, being this stereotypical? Seriously?

""You must have questions,"" God added. He stood up and stepped down from the steps leading up to His throne. The clouds making up the realm shifted and solidified into a glowing white couch. 

""A couch? Seriously?"" God ignored me and sat on the couch, leaving plenty of room for me. I sat down, pressed against the armrest, glaring at him suspiciously. ""Okay,"" I said. ""Fuck right I have questions. First: What accident?""

God sighed. His face seemed immensely sad, but if that was supposed to make me feel sympathetic it didn't work. ""The accident,"" he said, which cleared up absolutely nothing. ""The greatest accident of all. Do you know the story of Genesis?"" 

I nodded. Of course I did. 

""You should know it is only partly true. The seven days are an approximation. Creation, of course, took eons. At first, I was a child. Hard to believe, I know, but even a being such as me has their beginnings."" God smiled sadly. ""I had a mother. I had a father. They begat me, and they gave me their power, and they were no more. This is what my kind does, you see. We create. You, humanity, were my first creation. Even now, you are my only creation. It took millennia, but I made you, and I watched you prosper. I left you to your devices. I liked watching you grow, you see. On your own.""

I stood up, trembling. ""So that's it? Are you telling me you just *watched*?""

God nodded. 

""That's all you did. You watched."" I punched him. That's it -- I punched God Himself. He didn't even react. My hand hurt like I had hit a brick wall. ""You did nothing, you lazy fuck, while we raped and burned and warred and -- and--""

My voice turned into a wordless yell. I got up and paced, running my hands through my hair, while God watched. That's all he did -- watch. I hated him so much at that point. ""So what -- we're just fish in the tank to you?"" 

""The universe--"" he began, expressionless as when I hit him. 

""WHAT about the universe?"" 

""The universe,"" he began again, sitting calmly on the sofa, ""grew larger than I had hoped. Other worlds sprang up, and I gifted them with life. Other civilizations sprang up, and I watched them prosper or fall."" He looked directly into my eyes. ""You are not the center of the world. Is that so hard to believe?""

I opened my mouth. He held a hand out, closing his eyes for a second, and I fell silent. He was God, I remembered. He could smite me, right now. He could rip me from existence, leaving behind only a messy flat and siblings that would barely notice my disappearance. 

""Okay,"" I said. ""I'll let you talk. Talk.""

""This is my apology. I am sorry.""

""That's it?!""

""No -- but I did ruin your life. I ruined all of your lives, so I'm giving you an option. All of you."" He spread his arms out. Windows sprang up in the air above them, windows showing sleeping figures all over the world. ""All of you will dream me, and all of you will get the same message. I am sorry. And--""

He paused. An emotion flitted across his face. ""And I am going to offer you your salvation. There is a new world waiting. I have created it already. It is beautiful, safe, and verdant. You will be happy, I promise, and you will be watched over. You have my word.""

The windows closed. God lowered his hands. His face was wrinkled. I hadn't noticed before. Looking closer, I could see thin red lines in the whites of his eyes and tired crow's feet at the corners. He looked old. I watched him, and he transformed from me into somebody immeasurably old and immeasurably ancient and -- tired. 

God was tired. 

""Are you saying--""

""Eden,"" he said, finishing the thought before it left my mouth. He nodded. ""Yes, I have Eden. I will return it to you."" He snapped his fingers. ""I'll start over, but you'll remain. And this time, I will watch over you.""

""What about what we already did?"" What about the Taj Mahal, the pyramids? The flag on the moon? All the art created, over all of those centuries?"" 

""No."" He shook his head, face somber. ""It will be a new start. You will create new wonders, and you will remember the old wonders, but they will be gone with this world.""

I did not speak at first. God waited patiently, hands folded in His lap. The angels hovered around us. Back in the real world was a planet, and its seas were growing dark with pollution and its forests thin, but on it there was a civilization of lights. We could not leave it like that. Things may get better. Things had got better: women could vote, racism was generally agreed upon as terrible, and telescopes were scanning back to moments before the Big Bang. It felt wrong to leave all of that behind. 

""No,"" I said. 

God closed his eyes for a second. ""I thought you would say that."" 

""Let me wake up.""

He waved a hand, and around me Heaven was giving way to blackness. That's when I woke up, and I lay there, minutes before my alarm rang out, staring up the ceiling. I could hear a car backfiring down the street, and the leaky faucet in the bathroom was dripping away like a metronome. 

I sat up, pushed aside the blinds. A dawn sun was peaking over the horizon, painting the horizon pink and yellow. The sky looked like it was on fire. I shut the blinds again, casting myself in darkness, and waited for the rest of the world to make its decision.

So she made no attempt to. The deliberate nature in which she was being toyed with was near enough to rile her into a frenzy she hated herself for entertaining. Rising her hips to meet with the pressure afforded to her swollen mound, Cass moaned breathily. All in quick succession, respite never quite finding time to settle. She abided to the slow, teasing tempo he had set. The bastard may have been greedy but he had not turned her into some desperate bitch just yet; even as the heat in her was coaxed out of her cunt with a care that bore resemblance to nothing she had known.

As his weight was eased atop her, the hint of her error came in *his* hesitation. And when Darick halted a low, extended groan rose as response to her wanting. Her squirming fruitless as the friction was so expertly receded.

Frantically the bastard worked to retrace her words in mind. As Wylde's inquiry carved through a lie that she had assumed would rouse no suspicion. Cass' efforts in placating the Castellan backfiring as rapidly as she had let the guilt of the act be passed to another. One of the few things Orys had been innocent of that now threatened to be her downfall. How funny he would have found it all, ""Estermont did worse to me than slice *me*, Lord Castellan.""

She allowed her head to ease back to the table. There was no where for her to go. Not to be safe from Darick's prying or the stories she had weaved. And not from the breath, warm-- no, *hot* now as it drifted across her neck. Snaking behind her earlobe. Shuddering, ""The Fat Lord had given him the sword. When he still lived, with blade stained light and dark on either side, much as he was really. How proudly he struted to me with it at his hip. Said how a man so rarely got to choose where their first cut will fall. It was a conquest.

1618,"I liked this episode.  Funny thing is it's continuing from the episode I really disliked ""To Where and Back Again"" where Chrysalis inexplicably captures all of Equestria's monarchy only to have her plans foiled by Starlight and her reformed villains posse.    

Here Chrysalis, who is why I probably liked this episode because she is still a villain,  is foiled yet again this time by her own creation, a sort of throwback to Discord's spell turning the Mane 6 to their polar opposites.   They're not grayed out though, they just have different color cutie marks and they have a single hair out of place.   (So green apples turns AJ into a liar?)   The real and fake Mane 6 interact with another and it becomes a ""comedy of errors"" situation where accusations run rampant because of a lack of awareness.   So the story's been done before.   Still I found the entire episode to be enjoyable and with the addition of Starlight to the Mane 6, it had an extra element to the internal conflict.   I also like that the resolution was a stronger bond between friends and not tied up in explanations of what happened to whom and why.   

As for Chrysalis just flying away after her ""servants"" failed her with evil Twilight's attempt a mutiny, she gets to have her revenge for another day......meaning she's still a villain; [](/flutteryay)",2018-06-11 00:19:33

1635,"The last of the guests is ushered out by the guard. He wordlessly paces one last time around the hall; I evade his searching glances, eyeing him through the socket of his pride and joy. He turns to me suddenly, I fear he might see me; I slowly release my breath as he dismisses his suspicion. After pausing a moment, he sidles out of the room, his final footsteps echoing through the rafters.

Ba-dm, ba-dm, ba-dm, ba-dm.

I slither out from under the massive skull. I know his old ears can no longer hear me, but, just in case, I touch down softly. Besides, I enjoy the silence. It strikes me, it chills me. It is my own personal symphony, it is my own soothing melody. I stand facing Her, we lock eyes. The pride and joy of this museum of death, She sits, disembodied, day in and day out; She is a prisoner of Her ancient wisdom. I feel my heart begin to pound in anticipation.

Ba-dm, ba-dm, ba-dm, ba-dm.

I close my eyes, and my mind looks back. I remember, vaguely, the first time I met Her. Though it is blurred now, I remember the feeling of clarity I had when I locked eyes with Her. The eyes - well, the lack thereof - they understood. In what all these others called a beast of this uncivilized past, I saw myself. She is a prisoner of her age, of the things which they hope they might learn from Her mistakes; I am a prisoner of mine, of the things which they believe I cannot know. My eyelids flutter open, I hear the guard in the next hall over: such is my quiet. His steps echo, disturbing my peace.

Ba-dm, ba-dm, ba-dm, ba-dm.

His presence fades. She and I are one. I had thought this act best done in silence, but I feel a rhythm in the night. Gazing around the room, I feel the others staring into me. I cannot have my freedom, but by the grace - no, the neglect - of those who deign to dictate our lives, they can have theirs. A pounding rises in my ears.

Ba-dm, ba-dm, ba-dm, ba-dm.

I return to my hiding spot, I fish for my tool. It is almost too much for my arms to lift, but I am on a mission. I lay it onto the ground. I try to do so gently, but it clatters to the ground anyway. I dont care. I dont care about anything anymore. Ive been alone too long. My parents always thought they knew right. See how it served them. Mother knows best, what a tired old adage. She didnt know what was coming. Father didnt either. I did, I could hear it in the wheels. I could feel it in the road. The sound of an oncoming failure, the rhythm of catastrophe. 

Ba-dm, ba-dm, ba-dm, ba-dm.

What took them was certainly not special, wrecks happen all the time. What happened to Her, what happened to the others, what struck the world was a real disaster. I was resurrected, spared from my freedom by some cruel trick of fate; She was, too, forced to face again the struggle of the unknowing, the struggle against those who know best. They are probably still looking for me. Funny that the guards will find me first. I can feel it in the air, I can hear their footsteps coming as I heave my tool onto my shoulder. 

Ba-dm, ba-dm, ba-dm, ba-dm.

My next act is a carefully choreographed ballet, a dance made in silence but performed to the rising music of the night. An alarm sounds, adding its voice to the rising chorus in my mind. The time has come. My freedom has been taken, but She will have Hers. It is time. The tension rises, then releases. A soft drum beat begins to play.

Ba-dm.

1645,"Worse. MLP is propoganda endorsing monarchism, a variant of capitalism, and slavery. Film and Flam as well as several other antogonists are treated as Chrony capitalists which is portrayed as exploitative while ignoring how protagonists such as Ratity use a crush to manipulate a young dragon to labor for free. Twilights alicornification is blatantly done to make a new toy product. 

On deeper thoughts the lack of griffin/pony and even mating amongst ponies seems heavily segregated. Furthermore dragons, griffins, changelings, diamond digs, and more are portrayed in often negative stereotypes compared to the more pleasant Equestrian society which shows an Equine supremacist viewpoint. The divinely chosen and supported by the demigods of Equinekind educate the lesser races with regards to learning to be more friendly and functional.

With the correction included now only Pinkie and Fluttershy can be considered comrades. The conclusion is obvious. We must coopt the MLP fanbase.

1652,"My technique for sensitive women mostly involves making contact with the clitoral hood.  I flutter my tongue lightly over the hood, and inner labia.  When I want to increase the sensation I put my open mouth over the entire clitoral hood and suck it gently into my mouth and flutter my tongue over it.  For even more sensation I may press my open mouth firmly around the clitoral hood.

As others have said, communication is very important.  I find that some women need more and more stimulation as they are approaching orgasm, but just as they cross over into orgasm they become hyper\-sensitive and need less stimulation.  Some ladies literally grab my head and try to grind it into their crotch just before orgasm, and then begin pushing me away during orgasm.  So what I have worked out for simple communication is for them to put their hand on my head and grab a handful of my hair.  Then if I am stimulating too much they push away, and if they need more stimulation they pull me in.

One last trick I have learned for ladies who become hyper\-sensitive is to completely stop all sliding movements of my tongue over their clit (or clitoral hood), and instead switch to apply pressure around the clitoral hood with my lips.  I apply a fairly firm pressure and if I feel them pulling me in then I begin to rock my head from side to side (basically using my lips to massage around the clitoral hood.  If they still keep pulling me in then I will use my tongue to reach up to the very top of their clitoral hood and begin pushing down on it (basically with the bottom of my tongue because I am reaching up).  I only need to practice this method a few times to learn a lady's ideal sensitivity level.",2018-06-11 04:39:56

1669,"The room grew quiet immediately, as the norm when any new gods entered the meeting room.

An elvish fairly quickly fluttered over and greeted them, showing them over to two newly created empty seats.

Zeus stood up to greet them but Buddha, being closer, beckoned them to sit at the seats, asking, ""Please enlightened ones, tell us your names.""

""Why even ask their names when we already know it,"" grumbled Zeus as he sat back down into his chair. An arc of electricity carelessly tumbling off one end of his beard. 

Lord Helix nervously took its place next to Ein, the Corgi. Ein gave Helix a quick sniff and then paid Helix no further attention. ""My name, given to me by Twitch chat, is Helix Fossil, aka. Lord Helix. I became a God through a meme, guiding the scrubs in chat through the game until I became an Omanyte."" 

The Spaghetti Monster whispered, ""What's an Omanyte??"" as it slipped into the unoccupied seat to the other side of Ein. 

""The fuck should I know, its some pokemon thing. I just got here kek."" Lord Helix whispered back quickly. ""Go on now, I think they want to hear from you.""

""I was bequeathed Flying Spaghetti Monster by Bobby Henderson, aka FSM, God of the Church of Pastafarianism. Through the idioticy of the Kansas State Board of Education, I was birthed into our shared universe."" quipped FSM.

""Goodness goodness,"" Jesus exclaimed. ""Tell us something most of us god's wouldn't know as we would all like to get back to discussing how best to celebrate my favorite holiday!""

Some grumbling could be heard in the audience.

Suddenly, Ein, the Corgi God, snapped its head over towards the Spaghetti Monster and viciously devoured one of their meatballs.

""Oh, oh my god!"" exclaimed the spaghetti monster as it writhed in, well who knows. But quickly, a new meatball regenerated in its place. 

Then, Ein devoured that meatball. And this continued for several minutes until Ein decided it was no longer interested in this new found treat. Lord Helix busily watched this profound interest as it tweeted out copypastas directly into several million twitter burner accounts.

Zeus elbowed Buddha and grinned, ""I was wondering why you created those two seats next to Ein right before they entered.""

I realize I'm still clutching the stupid fucking coupon book. I'm so tired and done with the evening that I just laugh and start flipping through it. 

ONE FREE BACKRUB

An old classic. 

SHOWER SEX - DOGGY STYLE

POSITION OF YOUR CHOICE

""Fuck you,"" I coil my hand so hard that it hurts. I need to hit something, but it seems stupid. Punch a wall? 

I rip the backrub coupon out. It peels off with a satisfying tear. I sit there holding it for a second, feeling pretty dumb, then rip it again. Then I go for another. 

ROLEPLAY YOUR WAY

I start tearing by the line, then give up and shred indiscriminately. Vouchers flutter to the tile.

PUBLIC FUCK

I go to rip it, have my fingers on the edge of the paper, when I stop. Something about the effort of this one tickled me. No worldplay, no innuendo. 

I laugh. ""PUBLIC FUCK,"" I read aloud. The tantric wisdom humbles me. 

I thought about Louis and that goddamn smoulder. 

How did my sister end up with the better life? 

I rip the coupon out of the book. Gage's are always written on miniature spiral notepads, usually in his sloppy caps writing. These coupons are printed on glossy paper the same size and shape of a checkbook. I tear PUBLIC FUCK neatly along the corrugation. The bathroom seemed like such a good escape plan but now I'm here and I feel even more caged. Why am I hiding in the bathroom for my own birthday? 

The fucked up thing, is that Gage is probably right. I do need to chill out, just be grateful that I have family to celebrate with. I could use a good fuck, a stiff drink and a wild night. But I didn't want to do any of that with my husband. 

""Can I take this PUBLIC FUCK with my sister's boyfriend?"" I flapped the coupon, smiling to myself. 

Not even a second later the bathroom door swings open. 

It startles me, but I shake my head. Just someone using the bathroom. Hope they don't notice half a book of sex vouchers on the floor. I decide to wait it out. 

Then there's a knock on my stall. 

""Taken!"" who the fuck didn't notice me in here?

""Can I come in?"" Louis drawls

Holy shit

""It doesn't lock,"" I stand up, reach for the handle. At the same time he pushes his way in. The look on his face cuts me off sharp. 

Louis closes the stall behind him. Somehow I don't need words to know what's happening. I don't know if it's magic or chemistry but I don't wait for him to initiate. I know what I want. 

Louis slams against the stall and I press my body against his hungrily- he's all lank and lean muscle, his arms coil around me. 

For a second I almost hesitate, breathing heavily with my face a few inches from his. I have so many reasons to stop right now. But they're nothing. 

His mouth comes down on mine, hard. Our lips collide. Tongue and teeth connect in a frenzy, then we slow down, and he dips his tongue in my mouth, twisting it around mine. I moan into his throat. 

""Fuck,"" i coil my fingers around his shirt. He already has me panting. ""Fuck, fuck fuck."" 

""Shh,"" He puts his finger against my lips, then pushes it inside. I suck on it, feel blood rush in him where our bodies are connected. He smiles and leans in and nips my earlobe ""Just a sip"" 

""Fuck that,"" I slam him against the stall door again, kiss him needily, sucking his lip. He grabs my ass and pulls me closer. I start to grind on him. 

""In a rush?"" He whispers. He slides his hand up my shirt, but not far enough. His hands feel cool on my skin, but I'm burning like fire. 

""I fucking need you,"" my voice is hoarse. I slip my hand against his stomach, feel the muscles tightening underneath his skin. I slide my hand lower, toying with the waistband of his boxers. I'm trying to restrain myself from dropping to my knees, I have no idea how far this is supposed to go. Just when I think about shutting it down he stops playing with my nipples and slides his hand into my jeans. 

My hips buck. ""This is so fucked,"" I pant, rubbing myself against his hand. He smiles again. Puts his hand in my panties. The second his fingers slide against my pussy I moan so loud that he puts two fingers in my mouth to keep me quiet. He pins me against the stall and squeezes a finger inside me. 

""Fuck, you're tight,"" he groans. Another finger goes in. I fuck his fingers, desperately gyrating my hips. The playful look goes from his face, replaced by an intense, primal stare. He needs me. 

I slip onto my knees without another word. Louis looks thrown, but I put my finger to my lips and reach for his belt. He doesn't argue as I loosen it and tug his dress pants down. The size of the bulge in his boxers makes my mouth go dry. For a second I just rub it over his boxers, pang after pang of pleasure throbbing me. I never wanted someone this bad. 

I tease him like this, touching him just one layer away from his skin, until he gets impatient and tugs his boxers down, letting his cock spring out. I put him in my mouth he leans his head back, panting. 

""I can't fucking take this anymore,"" he says finally, and pulls me to my feet. ""Bend over,"" he tells me. 

""Should we be doing this?"" I pant, staring at his cock in my hand. 

He hesitates, staring at me with an agonized expression. ""It's on you."" 

Gage was probably still at the table, therapizing me with my own sister. 

""Fuck me,"" I said.

He didn't need more encouragement. I blushed, pulled my panties down with my shorts. I felt exposed and naked in a way that set me on fire. I barely knew Louis but he was so intense. The second my panties slipped over my pussy lips he groaned again. ""You look so fucking good."" 

It sends a heat wave through me, and out of impulse I lean in and kiss him again. But he returns it greedily, pushing me back against the stall. I feel his hand on my thigh, hoisting my leg over his shoulder. THen I feel him brush the head of his cock against my pussy lips. I'm so wet that he accidentally slips inside and we both groan in suprise. Once he's in, Louis seems to lose control, though, slamming the rest of his cock all the way inside me. I yelp involuntarily, filled too tight in a way that was good, too good. I buck against him, panting as I get used to the size, feeling a familiar tension coil inside me like a knot. Louis slowed for a moment, breathing hard. 

""Don't fucking stop,"" I plead with him. The animalistic look overtakes him again. He grabs my hips and fucks me hard against the stall. We go at it until I hear the door open again. 

""Anna?"" 

Gage. Oh, fuck

""Are you in here? We need to talk."" 

Oh, fuck. I cast a desperate look back at Louis, who's still inside me. 

""Look I don't know what you're doing back here. I know you're mad. But everythings over. Marie went home, she doesn't know where Louis went. Will you please just come home with me?"" 

Louis spread my ass and bounced my pussy back against him. 

""Anna?"" there's a knock at our stall. 

""I need a minute,"" I say back breathlessly. 

""Can you please come out?"" Gage sounds relieved. Blissfully unaware that my sister's boyfriend is railing me from behind over the bathroom stall. 

I want to answer, want to explain myself somehow. But then the knot coiling inside me gets tighter and I lose my breath. Then Louis slips his finger in my mouth again, pulls it out wet, and stuffs two fingers in my asshole. 

I'm pretty sure my marriage ended the second I came, mewling Louis' name as my pussy grinded back against him. I lock down around him and cum harder than I have in five years. Louis can't hold back any longer and starts slamming me agaist the stall so hard the whole bathroom shakes. I feel him tense and stop all at once, bucking inside me. He lets out a shuddering groan and finally pulls out, covered in my cum and his. I've never let anyone cum inside me before and it was fucking hot. 

Gage isn't in the bathroom when I exit the stall. Nor do I find him in the restaurant. He didn't pay the bill, which is understandable, and he didn't return my phone calls for a month. When he finally did, the only thing he said was ""it's over."" ",2018-06-11 10:49:02

I've tried to be friends with people but our values simply don't line up, nor do our communication styles or even energy levels. These relationships usually end up becoming temporary, colleague-like relationships even if we both seem to make effort in trying to build a relationship. On the other hand, with my two best friends, we've gotten along from the start, have all those things I mentioned before, and have very successful relationships. 

I've been on a few dates and have had the same occur. We're just not into the same things and their priorities are completely different from mine and aside from their face, there isn't much that does it for me. In fact, I feel almost embarrassed to be seen with them in public and it's just weird and I feel bad for feeling like that.

1681,"Our Main Six in the Movie with Different Dubs. I gathered them From the MLP Wikia Page here : https://mlp.wikia.com/wiki/We_Got_This_Together/International_versions
(exceptions are the Espana and English Versions, which took some Youtube Seach magic~)

If you've watched my previous demonstration you've seen what happens when I added 14 dubs in the same timespan, well I won't do this here, as I do not want to ruin the Song's Pacing, (Trust me I tried and while it wasn't as bad as I imagined, it still kinda ruined the song). For cases where Multiple Ponies are singing I will just use English, exceptions are if the Main Singer's voice outperforms the Background Singers, OR if  all singers are of the same dub.

Now for my choices for the Main Sixes Dubs: After going through Multiple Dubs I've decided on Czech or Danish for Pinkie Pie. At first I liked her Season 1-2 Czech VA, while she does have low energy she has great deliveries when needed, but then in Season 3 they've replaced her with a sub-par VA, and all the charm was lost. The Danish Dub is more reliable and the VA has a good overall performance so I will use it for Pinkie going forward, although her impacts aren't as impressive as the Season 1-2 Czech VA. For this case I went with Czech, done by Radka Fiarov, as her ending singing was a bit more impressive than the Danish dub. Tell me if you want to hear Danish instead.

Applejack, voiced by Ashleigh Ball stayed English cause she's based on the Cowboy stereotype, I could have used Latino as both languages have their histories in the Wild West but Rarity already has Spanish. It would feel odd if 2 of the Main six both speak Spanish so English it is.

Now with Rarity I went with Spanish, as I had that thought of it since Season 5, the dub was done by Marina Garca Guevara. Sadly no one had supplied the Wiki Page with a bluray Espana version, and Rarity's Latino dub was so weird that a Cinema recorded Espana dub was so much better. Sorry Guys.

Fluttershy is using Suomi, dubbed by Susa Saukko. Now it is just an average dub to use for a main character and I had thought of using German instead, but if you're familliar with MLP Multilanguage you would know that the Finnish and the Japanese dub has the Best Fluttershy freakouts, so great that I felt it was worth it for Fluttershy to use Finnish.

Rainbow Dash uses Russian, voiced by Tatyana Veselkina. Like Rarity I have also though about it since Season 5. I just thought that having her speak Russian would make her 20% cooler.

Now on to Twilight. I wanted her to speak Japanese as I felt like it would balance out a European language heavy Cast with an Asian one. However the Dub only covers Season 1 and 2 and the Latest Equestria Girls Shorts, so I can't use it if Season 3 till 8 doesn't have it. I have seen some snippets of Japanese in the Equestria Girls films but I can't for the love of all that is holy find anything concrete online, especially the songs! The same goes for the MLP movie, apparently it never got dubbed when it showed in Japan I guess... With heavy Heart I ended up using French as a substitute, with in the end was a great thing as it rocked my world! Nancy Philippot did an amazing job singing for Twilight, her voice was just so beautiful that I fell in love with it. I honestly would say that if this is the quality I will get for Twilight, I would use French for all of Twilight's roles~

1684,"> Thanks a lot for the recommendation! That sounds like an excellent addition to a script. When you say ""reinforce that feeling more and more,"" what exactly do I say? ""Your whole arm feels stiffer and stiffer the longer it stays held by the bar. It's starting to feel as stiff as the metal holding it up. It's stuck now. (pushes a little and the arm stay up) Now TRY to move it but you realize you can't. (They try and fail.) In a moment I will remove the bar and your arm will fall down slowly. As your arm falls you will get more deeply relaxed. Deeper and deeper. So relaxed.""

Exactly. And when you see it going down you keep talking. ""That's right, more and more relaxed. More and more. The deeper it goes the deeper you are"" etc.

> At this point can I do the ""tie your hand to a helium balloon"" with the same ""arm falls you get more deeply relaxed"" script to further induce them or would it serve no purpose? Is less more in this case or is scrambling their mind so-to-speak with more deepeners/convincers better?

To be honest: After this you should be there. It isn't necessary to use one deepener after another deepener. Of course if the hypnotee likes that and this is the only thing you aimed for then do it, but if you want to do other stuff instead then do that.

> Ah I see. So it's more about getting them to actively think on their own rather than ""flipping a switch."" It's like when your legs asleep and you have to shake it loose, but it's gradual?

Yes, I would describe it that way.

> I keep wanting to say ""deeper and more relaxed"" but I guess they're not necessarily the same thing, right?

This phrase has a place but a good deepener or fractionation usually does a lot more :)

> Would you recommend ""Mind Play"" as a good read? Is it more theory or technique?

Oh hell yes. It's more a ""kinky"" book because it's about erotic hypnosis. But that is almost just the last part of the book. It is very informative and well written. I had great fun while reading it. It's clearly more technique than theory.

> I feel like I'm more nervous about saying the wrong thing or messing up the steps

In my opinion you can't mess up that much, so don't worry. There are no magical words that have to be said in the correct order to work. You need to know what you are doing right now and you need to know what you want to archive. The confidence comes alone when you're doing it more often.

> so I might miss out on subtle changes both in induction

Sometimes they aren't so subtle. Look out for this changes:

- Eye fluttering. The eye lids of a person in trance seem to flutter.
- Blushing of skin: The blood flow in the skin will increase. E.g. my GF's face becomes red like a fire track when she goes under.
-Change of breathing
-Ideomotoric movements: People can start to move on their own like bobbing their head back and forth.
-Postural changes: Obviously you see the relaxation of their body. Sinking of the shoulders, head sinks down more and more etc.

I felt the wind caress my face and flick the end of my trench coat. It made me feel alive again, sent a rush through my veins that I hadn't felt in ages. Blood coursed through me, filling me with raw power. It made me want want to laugh, looking down at the city and its people.

Neoships flew just above the street, zipping around too fast to follow with the eye. Four-hundred-story buildings, sparkling with neon signs, poked at the clouds. VR booths stood every couple hundred meters, throwing holographic ads in people's faces. Police drones dotted the skies, looking for wanted criminals. The lighting nearly blinded me, even at night. I felt a pang of nostalgia for my childhood, when I could still see the stars. Most people nowadays grew up without even knowing what those were.

But it wasn't the buildings I liked to watch. It was the people. They were all so focused on being distracted. Everyone, it seemed, had a vice these days. And they wore them proudly, not like in my day. Back then, at least, there were rehab programs. Not anymore. Almost everyone on the street was partaking in an addiction of some sort. Be it an emote-o-vid to make them happy, some Rewire Tunes to change their brain pathways, popping pills, or an old-fashioned smoke of new-fashioned shit. Not that it mattered to me. It was all the same.

Not that I was getting all philosophical or anything. I really didn't give a shit. If people wanted to walk around dazed and high or whatever, who was I to judge? Made my job easier, anyway. Most modern drugs stopped the production of adrenaline, as a side effect. And even in the old days, they knew that when prey can't run, it makes them easier to catch.

It was exceptional, the size of half a valley, crooked with gnarly twists and patches of green. Two thick, albine branches constrated its otherwise brown bark, while an army of thin, yet endless trees escorted it as silent, watchful soldiers.

We halted our boats before the tree. A set of stairs lay beyond, waiting for us to ascend and unravel the secrets of these strange lan--

The tree crackled and snapped. A rain of errant bark and leaves fell upon us, yet the racket didn't hamper. It got louder instead, like thunder striking nearby.

The pale-white branches rose, revealing their true essence, condemning our ignorance. Dragons, the old tales had called them. Beasts of sharp claws and fire for tongue, membranous wings capable of sinking ships with a flutter, bearers of an elegance worthy of gods.

Yelps, shrieks and squeals joined the cacophony. I peered around, the great spears of bark piercing, obliterating my fleet and my men, their crimson and their souls fading in the river, all while the dragons gazed with those scalding eyes, impassive, unimpressed.

Soon, amidst the chaos, a shadow dawned upon me, growing, turning the day into night. I took a deep breath, for I would die the same death as my men. I looked around for the last time. The peaceful currents, now a chaos of broken boats, driftwood and mangled corpses.

So I'm sitting there, smoking my cigar, thinking about how my entire future depends on this test (I did really well, but it didn't depend on that test) and then start to walk home.  I'm coming up on my street, ready to turn right, and then I see something or someone coming down the hill in front of me on the street.  Background: I live in a really rural area, but in a somewhat packed neighborhood.  The kind of neighborhood where everyone knows each other, and has lived there for decades.  So seeing a stranger in my neighborhood is odd.  Coming down the hill towards me, about 200 feet away, is someone wearing all black.  A black bolero hat with a wide brim, and a black cape fluttering behind them, as they either ran, glided, or rode a bike towards me, at 11pm, pitch fucking black out.

I enjoyed every *individual* scene. But the episode taken *as a whole* was deeply flawed in ways that I cannot ignore.

[](/sp)

[](/chrysalis) Chrysalis combines an amazing ability to sneak around undetected with an equally amazing ability to sabotage herself - creating simulacra of the Mane Six and then having them start turning against her *immediately* is really not a good idea. So, in other words, perfectly in character and very well handled. I liked Chrysalis in this episode.

[](/sp)

The Mean Six - brilliantly done. I enjoyed their designs, I really liked their characterisations. The way they each lacked their counterpart's Element - and the way that the Tree *noticed* this lack and protected itself - those were all great, too.

And I had a lot of fun watching the episode. So another plus there.

**But...**

The biggest flaw in this episode was the random interactions between the Mean Six and the Mane Six. (I can see where that came from - the writers knew they'd only have one episode and clearly wanted to squeeze in as many Mean/Mane interactions as they could). But, really, all that time, the two groups bumbling around in the forest so close to each other, *neither* group having a plan - and not a *single* pony met their own counterpart? And it was close sometimes, too...

It's just so... improbable. It's the same problem as Castle Mania had. And that's before taking into account all the strange little coincidences that led the Mean Six to so *perfectly* mess with the Mane Six - Applejack just *happening* to be the one carrying loads of stuff for Mean!Rarity to take, or Starlight just *happening* to have been dressed up by Applejack to make it hurt more when Mean!Applejack made fun of her appearance.

not some foreign land.

Concise is when your verses are understandably short,     
this is wise so you never choke or snort.

Catchy is achieved by memorable lyrics,     
not patchy and slapped together by empirics.

1737,"[\[Source\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/8ou1zl/a_man_wakes_up_in_a_dingy_slum/)

A man wakes up in a dingy slumwith no memory of how he got there. He wanders around aimlessly before he finds even one person who will talk to him. Some ratty beggar on the street turns out to be nice enough to explain where he is.

""You're in the afterlife!"" he tells the man, ""But you must have been a real shithead when you were alive, because this is the fourth ring, and only the worst people come here.""

All of a sudden, a siren goes off, one of those air-raid things. The man is terrified but the beggar gets up calmly and leads him to a big, dilapidated warehouse where thousands of other similarly unkempt souls are gathering. When the man asks why they're all here, the beggar points to a line of folding tables against the wall. Each table has some moldy bread, cups of dingy water, and some bowls of broth so thin they could have just run out of cups. Only then does the man realize how hungry he is. A guard in heavy body armor blows a whistle and all the people arrange themselves into three lines.

The beggar is helpful enough to explain them for the man. ""That one's the bread line, that's the broth line, and that's the water line. All the food here is free, but if you want to get out of this maggot hole, you've got to work, because the gate guards into the third ring ask five hundred dollars to get through. I've heard the food is better there.""

So the man gets his food. It's abominable, and right then and there, he vows to make five hundred dollars and get into the third ring. Unfortunately for him, very few people need work in the afterlife, especially when all of them are saving up to emigrate. Even still, after ten years of hard work, eating the moldy bread and indistinguishable soup and water, he finally saves up enough money. The guards let him through and he finds himself in the third ring. It's nothing too fancy, if anything, it's a bit below average for a real city, but to his eyes it is paradise. All the guards look much friendlier, and the houses and buildings, while not spacious or lavish, are at least up to code. And to his surprise, he runs right into a familiar former beggar as he crosses the street.

""What are the odds?"" they both ask and they get to conversing. The beggar, it turns out, only managed to make it in himself a few months back. Their conversation is interrupted, however, by what sounds like a school bell. When the man seems confused, the beggar leads him to what looks like a giant gymnasium. Here, people are gathering once again, and the man begins to understand. On a line of folding tables against one wall are stacks of hot dogs, big bowls of salad, and solo cups full of fresh lemonade. A cop shouts for everyone's attention and directs them all to stand in three lines. The beggar smiles at the man's wonder and points to each line in turn. ""That's the hot dog line, that's the salad line, and that's the lemonade line."" The man gets in each line in turn and gets himself his lunch.

While he's eating, basking in joy at not being stuck with old bread and water, the beggar encourages him, ""The best part is, halfway through the year, they switch from hot dogs, salad, and lemonade to chicken, chili, and hot chocolate. You can never get tired of it!""

Sadly, this proved not to be true. After only a few days, the man did again get tired of the same meal every day. But he knew firsthand that he could change his lot, so one day he went up to the wall of the second circle. This time the guards were asking for ten thousand dollars. Well, the man didn't like it, but he figured he had his whole afterlife ahead of him now that he was out of the fourth circle, and he could certainly take some time to save up. After ten years of hard work, it wasn't too difficult for him to keep up the work ethic, and only twenty years later, he went back to the guards of the second ring with the money in hand. He went through the gate and found himself in a glittering, clean city full of glass and steel.

And wouldn't you know it, but there, standing across the street was the same beggar, only now he was wearing a well-fitted suit. The man greeted the beggar as an old friend and they started talking again. Once again, their conversation was interrupted, only this time it was by beautiful church bells. ""Come,"" the beggar told him, ""I'll take you to the evening meal."" So the man followed and they entered a glamorous ballroom filled with beautiful attendees. Even the cops here looked good, dressed in suits and sunglasses like bodyguards. And sure enough, piled onto platters on huge mahogany tables against the far wall were plates of steak, bowls of the most delicious seafood soups, and glasses of champagne. One of the bodyguards cleared his throat loudly and politely requested that the attendees line up. Three lines were formed and the beggar pointed each line out in turn. ""That's the steak line, that's the soup line, and that's the champagne line,"" and then he added, ""and apparently here, they change the meals FOUR times a year!""

The man rejoiced, ate, and was happy, and for once felt that nothing was lacking. Four changes a year was enough for him. But one day, out of curiosity, he went up to the bodyguards that guarded the gate into the first and final ring of the afterlife and found they were asking for a million dollars to pass. Well the man was a bit disturbed by this, after all, the second ring seemed perfect to him. ""What is it,"" he thought, ""that could possibly be more wonderful than what I have here?"" That question haunted him for weeks until he came to a conclusion. He was used to working hard and he had all of eternity to save up, so he wanted, just once to see what he could possibly be missing in the first ring.

Fifty years later, he returned to the guards with a million dollars. When he stepped into the first ring he fell to his knees. The architecture was glorious and inhuman, and the bodyguard had turned into shining angels. To his surprise, someone helped him up off the street and when he looked, he realized he recognized who it was--it was the beggar he met in the fourth ring, adorned in a golden robe and glowing, and when he looked down at himself he realized he looked much the same.

The beggar laughed jovially. ""I got here only three years ago myself, but somehow I knew you would be right here behind me. I've come back to this gate every day waiting for you to make it in!"" Suddenly, the air was filled with the sound of angelic choirs and the beggar led the man off to a gigantic palace made of crystal and cloud. The room was filled with radiant citizens of the first circle and angels prepared everything. Sure enough, there was a line of massive altars against one wall, spilling over with glistening golden dragon meat, a pudding refined from clouds and dew and silk, and an ice cold tub of ambrosia and nectar ladled out individually into blindingly beautiful crystalline chalices. An angel fluttered from the ceiling and bowed silently to the assembled mass, who bowed respectfully back and then broke themselves into their lines on their own.

Smiling at the tradition, the beggar pointed to the first line. ""That's the line for the dragon meat,"" he said before turning to the next line, ""and that's the line for angeldust stew,"" then he paused, confused.

""What is it?"" the man asked his old friend.

The beggar replied, ""There appears to be no punchline.""",2018-06-11 23:10:15

""I'd like to ask my Lord something. Something about a shared neighbour of ours. Would the table here be best, or do we need to step outside the hall for such a discussion?"" She asked, fluttering her eyelashes innocently.

1743,"You simply cannot blame my husband for sticking his rod into every mortal that spreads her legs and beckons him forth in order to give birth to some half\-breed, half\-god, whole pain in my ass. Whether a king, or a god, Zeus is at his core no more than any other man, a slave to that which hangs beneath him. How fitting for Zeus to design men with the source of their shame hanging betwixt their legs.

Still, I do draw the line at dangling me from a bloody chain after I lashed out at him for one indiscretion too many. Well, let's see how he likes his current situation, bound tight in the chain at the heart of Mt. Olympus, buried under a pile of his offspring that was tall enough to blot out the sun several times over. 

I'll concede, it was thrilling to watch the way he begged and groveled. I'm so used to domineering on a macro level, sending storms and plagues of serpents to do my bidding; it was surprising just how good it felt to go down to a micro level and really get my hands dirty, metaphorically speaking. And now, with a river of honey flowing forth from my womanhood, whatever is a Queen of the Gods to do? I certainly cannot expect that fool of a husband that tried to banish me, ME, from the heavens to properly sate my needs. I'm starting to wonder if a cat stole his tongue when he was off tarrying about as a goose given how rarely I find it between my folds. 

Still riding high on the sense of power I felt, I decided to exact a little revenge on one of his latest 'conquests', as if it is SO hard to conquer a mortal. A little flash of golden light and most of them will offer you anything, marveling at your power. 

Agathe was  a commoner in some common village, so of course Zeus had fucked her, bragging about how agathos her mouth had been over some ambrosia. She was pretty, by mortal standards, with dark skin and darker hair, and just the hint of a bump swelling in her stomach. I could feel a flutter in my own nether regions as I approached her, alone at the edge of her village. Was the golden light I was bathing myself in, or the majestic crown of glittering gems from other realms too gauche? Possibly. No matter, it had the intended effect and the girl prostrated herself before me. 

""Hera, I'm so sorry, he..."" Agathe started off, tears streaming down the corners of her eyes, but I silenced her with a stern finger. 

""Do not think that I am so foolish as to let my husband wander the mortal realm without keeping a close eye on him. I saw you, Agathe,"" I spat her name out her with as much venom as I could muster, trying to ignore the dripping sensation between my thighs. 

""I'm so sorry Hera,"" she cried again, bowing even lower, the smooth curve of her hips padding out nicely as motherhood reshaped her form. 

""Goddess,"" I corrected, ""Until I tell you otherwise, you are to end every sentence with Goddess. Remember your place beneath me. Now then,"" I walked closer, standing above her, a mantle of flame over my head, ""Lie down on your back mortal.""

Anxiously, with tears still flowing down her cheeks, Agathe did as I bade her. She lay on her back, the simple tunic she wore creeping up and exposing a thin ribbon of stomach, her dress slit up the leg to reveal an ample amount of her thigh. Hitching up my regal himation, I stood over her, slowly lowering my dripping slit down onto her face. 

""Worship me, mortal,"" I sighed as I took my place atop her mouth. Her tongue was nervous at first, darting out to lightly stroke my lips, but the juices of a goddess taste grander than any earthly delight, and within moments she was hungrily lapping and sucking at my pussy, as I taunted her. My hands found her breasts, squeezing and pinching them, slapping and even biting down on the tender flesh.

""You thought you could steal a God with these? Mortals, will your hubris never cease to amaze me?"" I taunted her in between moans as she worked her tongue deep within my folds. I could feel pleasure building within me, partially the complete submission of this obedient mortal, partially the skill with which her tongue slid up and down the length of my pussy, and the careful attention she doted on my clitoris. I had forgotten how good carnal acts could feel. The first orgasm in centuries tore through my body and a wave of power surged through me, blessing this new mother with a set of incredible breasts, swollen with milk, ready for her child's arrival. 

I rolled from my perch, taking a fistful of hair in my left hand and rolling her onto her stomach. My right proceeded to give her a vicious spanking, each blow harder than the one before it, the pain steadily increasing as I turned her dark\-olive skin a brilliant crimson with the heat of my hand. 

""You filthy slut, you wanton whore, you absolutely pathetic mortal, BEG your Goddess forgiveness and repent!"" I roared, with a fury that impressed even me.

Agathe cried, ""Please Goddess, I shall worship you, I shall tell all of your mercy and grace. Your beauty outshines any star in the sky, please Goddess, spare me and I shall serve you for all eternity.""

Smiling, I relented in my spanking. Leaning down to kiss her, her lips still soaked with my juices, I locked eyes with her and said, ""That is exactly what I had hoped you would say. My husband already has quite the menagerie, don't you think it's time I found a few concubines of my own. Now then,"" my hands urged her back between my thighs, ""Show Goddess how gracious you are for her mercy.""

I slipped back into a reverie as her tongue noisily worshipped my slit, circling my clit in a heavenly way, and thought of founding my own religion. Let the men have their mountains and storm clouds, my faith will be founded on something so much softer and yet more rewarding. As Agathe drew forth another earthshattering orgasm with her eager tongue, I locked my legs behind her head, depriving her of air, filling her entire sensory system with only my taste, my scent, my warmth, my softness and whispered, ""Worship mortal, worship your new Goddess. Your pain shall be my pleasure, and you shall forevermore belong to me.""

Oh yes, a harem of my own would be a truly fine idea. ",2018-06-12 01:02:49
1744,"Its [TBWL]  THE BOY WHO LIVED
and this is why 


Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say
that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last
people you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious,
because they just didn't hold with such nonsense.
Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made
drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did
have a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had
nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she
spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the
neighbors. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their
opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.
The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and
their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn't
think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs.
Potter was Mrs. Dursley's sister, but they hadn't met for several years;
in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn't have a sister, because her
sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was
possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would
say if the Potters arrived in the street. The Dursleys knew that the
Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him. This boy
was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn't want
Dudley mixing with a child like that.
When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story
starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that
strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the
country. Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for
work, and Mrs. Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming
Dudley into his high chair.

1747,"Obak, a grey skinned and fearsome sized 20 foot ogre, began to pick his toes with his new ""Pickin' stick"" relaxing leisurely in his caved littered with the bones of goats, cattle, and the random junk he has collected over his very long and lazy life.

There came a ruffled hooting from atop artistically placed set of animals skulls that piled up to make a sizable mound.

An owl fluttered its wings and spoke. ""You make little use of the staff, Ogre. Perhaps you could return to a simple understanding of the world and be able to enjoy your squalor in ignorant bliss.""

""Me thinks not,"" Said the ogre moving the sticks to begin picking at his oversized ears. ""Relinquishing the wisdom granted by this here staff would be quiet foolish of me... Plus, I rather enjoy the company of a minor goddess such as yourself.""

The owl hooted in displeasure. ""That staff was meant for my chosen champion. I had expended a great deal of my influence in this realm for it to find a suitable champion--it fell from the heavens and chose the wisest mortal in the entire realm.""

""That scrawny child didn't seem very wise wandering into the forest alone, and dropping his staff when he ran. All I wanted to do was scare him a little. Though I wonder what he was even planning on doing.""

""I created the staff to seek out the wise and inspire the wielder upon a journey to amass wisdom and wealth of philosophical treasures."" The owl began to slip from the pile as the bones toppled over and she took flight.

""Hrm. I am not so inclined to travel. Perhaps that is because I understand the consequences of leaving my forest.""

The two were quiet for a time as the ogre began to pick underneath his fingernails.

The owl sunk low and began to take stray garbage in its beak and talons, scraps of cloth and dried grasses mostly. Solemly building a nest... ""My father was right.""

""Oh? I am quite interested in hearing what the God of Gods thinks.""

""The wisdom of mortals has waned."" The owl began to perch circle around the shaudily made nest and look down to the dirt. ""I was called foolish for believing there was something value in the  wisdom of mortals. I saw something that I believe we could learn from. My brothers and sisters thought I was insulting them by considering mortals even had any other value than to feed their egos and power over the mortal realm. Now... I am am just a foolish barn-owl in an ogre's cave. The staff was my last effort to rekindle a... Hope I had had. I wanted to seek out something new and profound that would make them see that there was still something to learn... But..."" The owl sunk low as her thoughts trailed, and her eyes revealed her a sadness.

The ogre stopped his grooming, and let out a though ""Hrm."" He shifted himself to lay down and face the owl. ""That is a wise belief to have. Even though I have relegated to being secluded into this forest, news from foreign lands still comes my way. Mortals are quite fond of growing wiser and wiser.""

The owl shook her head. ""Not so much anymore. Things have become perilous in many nations. War. Political strife. Libraries burned in sieges... Knowledge and books lost. Teachers, and philosophers turned soldiers never to return to their lecture halls.""

""Well. Perhaps it will all blow over and peace can return and wisdom will once again be appreciated.""

The owl shook her again. ""Fueled by the other gods, the continues strife is assured. They want to presume a certain status of the world they find most entertaining. Pitting their champions and followers against one another... I pleaded with my father, and I suppose my siblings supported the thought of me becoming bound to the mortal world. I wish I hadn't been so critical and... Annoying to them.""

""Oh ha!"" The ogre pounded the floor with his hand and caused the pile of bones to collapse even further. ""I don't find you annoying at all. Perhaps some of the best company I have had in centuries. If you ask me--it is smart that the gods want to keep the things the same. Given time, I am sure the mortals would climb their way to the heavens and return the favor for centuries of war and death.""

The owl turned her head to the side, finding something puzzling about his words. ""What do you mean?""

""Well. You see. You were right to believe that humans grow and become more and more wise. Sadly the opposite is true and they can become terribly foolish. I remember when humans lived in caves like me, and then they invented fire, walls, stone cities, machines to carry water and shape the land. It is easy to be afraid of how quickly humans can grow. I find them... Like one big person, even though they may live short lives--they have children and they impart them with the some of their knowledge and way of life. They have very little at times, but are still able to want to grow. They aren't like some gods who have all this power and see no consistent challenge or need to overcome. I have yet to gauge really how powerful some gods are--though I believe it is silly to believe they are all powerful. Look at you.""

The owl sighed. ""It appears the staff has blinded you with my 'wisdom'. I once said something like that. Though I never quite believed they would ascend and overthrow my family.""

""Well. We don't know for sure, but it would be interesting to see. And to be honest..."" The ogre put down the staff infront of him by the owl. ""I don't really feel all that wiser wielding the staff.""

""Well... It appears it is just another one of my failed endeavors. Maybe if I beg and plead with my father I can return to the heavens and become a goddess of something else. Maybe the goddess of failures.""

""Or whining and feeling sorry for yourself."" The ogre groaned as he stood up and began to stretch. ""But it appears I have grown attached and partial to you Milady. Seeing you upset rather pains this ogre's heart. Perhaps we SHALL travel and see for ourselves the status of this world. If the world is getting unwiser, than that means more foolish travels coming to my forest with their pointy weapons and bothering me.""

""What? You don't mean to actually travel now do you?""

""Why not. I have fallen out of touch with the world as of late. As a mortal myself, I find it particularly offensive that the gods seem keen to controlling our fates. Perhaps together we may find that wisdom your family aught to learn.""

The owl scoffed... ""I remain unconvinced that is a good idea.""

""Well. You are bound to staff."" The Ogre picked up the staff and tucked it behind behind his ear. ""So you go where I go. I look forward to your protection and guidance in my travels. I have little use for the goddess of failures, so if you could continue to be The Goddess of Wisdom--I would appreciate it.""

The owl fluttered about and began to follow the Ogre as he left the cave. Perching herself on his head. ""I recognize your words are supposed to make me feel better, and I didn't expect such kindness from an ogre. Though I still doubt my own wisdom.""

""That is a very wise thing to do--doubting, evaluating, and changing your own wisdom. If you are capable of growing your fuant of wisdom--then I am sure other gods can too.""

The owl felt lossed as she examined his words. Seeing it as something she once held firm in her philosophy... Having another person say the words though gave her a much needed bit of hope and relief. ""I doubt this will be an easy journey, Ogre.""

""Obak is me name, Milady--and... It appears we have encountered our first bit of trial to overcome.""

'THAT IS THE OGRE!"" screamed a boy. ""He wanted to eat me!"" It had been the original wielder of the staff.

A mob of armored guards had gathered around the cave entrance with long lances and swords.

""Well. This will be an interesting encounter."" Said the Obak.",2018-06-12 02:00:45

1751,"Our Main Six in the Movie with Different Dubs. I gathered them From the MLP Wikia Page here : https://mlp.wikia.com/wiki/We_Got_This_Together/International_versions (exceptions are the Espana and English Versions, which took some Youtube Seach magic~) UPDATE: Espana has been fixed, all thanks to MeGAct for giving me a link to the clean version.

If you've watched my previous demonstration you've seen what happens when I added 14 dubs in the same timespan, well I won't do this here, as I do not want to ruin the Song's Pacing, (Trust me I tried and while it wasn't as bad as I imagined, it still kinda ruined the song). For cases where Multiple Ponies are singing I will just use English, exceptions are if the Main Singer's voice outperforms the Background Singers, OR if all singers are of the same dub.

Now for my choices for the Main Sixes Dubs: After going through Multiple Dubs I've decided on Czech or Danish for Pinkie Pie. At first I liked her Season 1-2 Czech VA, while she does have low energy she has great deliveries when needed, but then in Season 3 they've replaced her with a sub-par VA, and all the charm was lost. The Danish Dub is more reliable and the VA has a good overall performance so I will use it for Pinkie going forward, although her impacts aren't as impressive as the Season 1-2 Czech VA. For this case I went with Czech, done by Radka Fiarov, as her ending singing was a bit more impressive than the Danish dub. Tell me if you want to hear Danish instead.

Applejack, voiced by Ashleigh Ball stayed English cause she's based on the Cowboy stereotype, I could have used Latino as both languages have their histories in the Wild West but Rarity already has Spanish. It would feel odd if 2 of the Main six both speak Spanish so English it is.

Now with Rarity I went with Spanish, as I had that thought of it since Season 5, the dub was done by Marina Garca Guevara, who has done a wonderful job singing for Rarity.

Fluttershy is using Suomi, dubbed by Susa Saukko. Now it is just an average dub to use for a main character and I had thought of using German instead, but if you're familliar with MLP Multilanguage you would know that the Finnish and the Japanese dub has the Best Fluttershy freakouts, so great that I felt it was worth it for Fluttershy to use Finnish.

Rainbow Dash uses Russian, voiced by Tatyana Veselkina. Like Rarity I have also though about it since Season 5. I just thought that having her speak Russian would make her 20% cooler.

Now on to Twilight. I wanted her to speak Japanese as I felt like it would balance out a European language heavy Cast with an Asian one. However the Dub only covers Season 1 and 2 and the Latest Equestria Girls Shorts, so I can't use it if Season 3 till 8 doesn't have it. I have seen some snippets of Japanese in the Equestria Girls films but I can't for the love of all that is holy find anything concrete online, especially the songs! The same goes for the MLP movie, apparently it never got dubbed when it showed in Japan I guess... With heavy Heart I ended up using French as a substitute, with in the end was a great thing as it rocked my world! Nancy Philippot did an amazing job singing for Twilight, her voice was just so beautiful that I fell in love with it. I honestly would say that if this is the quality I will get for Twilight, I would use French for all of Twilight's roles~

1756,"It's not like I like my job, but I need to pay bills like anyone else. The Commstat digs deep into my target's mind. His eye roll into the back of his head as the green metallic headband on top of his head goes to work. Through my interface I can see the memory that'll make me rich float to the surface. The CommStat let's me experience everything my target had seen, felt, tasted, and even touched. I knew how his coffee had been cold that morning when he went to work, the feel of his sons hair rustled under his hand, his wifes orange flavored lips, and his pain at seeing his late daughters photo on the mantle of the fireplace. Those weren't the memories I'd wanted to steal though. I wanted something more valuable than that. I use the CommStat to fast-forward through my Target's boring morning and uneventful day of shuffling papers all the way to the experiment. 

I need to hurry. In my own peripherals I can hear his security task force banging at the door. I can feel my heart race as I fast forward and my Target's body twitches in response to the invasive presence in his mind. The bagging grows louder. I need more time!

Pause!

There it is, the formula that'll make me rich is in this memories map. Bright of lightning on the whiteboard in front of his marker stained hands. I break the CommStat and my Target slums in his chair. He'll live but he won't hold onto this anymore. I tear the metallic Commstat from his head and with it the Memory of Creation. The source of all my very career.

The door breaks down in time for the Security detail to see me jump from the open window. It's the 7th story so I have a moment to review the value of his memory. 

The Target is excited because after everything he'd scarified, he was going to make history. The girl stands in front of him. She cant be more than 10 years old. She is the same age as his daughter. The poor girl doesn't understand what this past year of experiments has been for. She just thinks it's because she's sick, that's what he'd told her and her parents. I feel no guilt from this memory only a sense of pride. It's a mix of pride at what he has accomplished and what she is about to. Gently he places the metallic ring on her head. Its lighter than it appears. He encourages her to sit and then initiates the memory transfer. 

The girl screams but there is no one to hear here. The memories flood her young mind and take root. Who she is is whipped clean and all that is left is the goal hed been striving for. Her eyes flutter open and she whispers, Dad?

I cant review this now. I pull my shutte. The parachute above me billows out and I stir myself to the waiting getaway car. Still I cant help but feel the tears falling down my face. His joy at being reunited with the memories of his daughter conflict with my own disgust at the entire affair. He is a monster that brainwashed a child into being his own. The flashbacks of his own daughters illness race through my Commstat and I cant turn the damn thing off. His plan forms then. What are minds but the memories they carry? 
I cut the cord and land on my motorcycle. Kickstarting the old thing to life I race away with the memory of the first mind transplant. Immortality in the form of memories. A thin smile curls across my face as I close the depressing thing. I race into the night. Im rich. ",2018-06-12 04:23:16

1769,"When it comes to flutter kicking you aim for two things:

1. Straight legs 
2. Pointed toes 

You want a bit of bend to your knees so that your legs are rigid, but you need to find the line between bending your knees the right amount and too much. When bending the knees too much, you dont go anywhere fast. 

Position 

When kicking you want to have small kicks right under the surface of the water, close enough to make the water look like its boiling. Having actual splashes means your feet are too high. If your feet are too low the water above will remain still and your body position will be more vertical. 


If equipment is allowed at your facility (which should be likely) it would be good to get a flutter board and practice kicking drills to get better at your technique. Start with 5m and once youve made the distance 3 times perfectly add another 5m. 

Even better, if your facility has flippers I strongly recommend you practice kicking with them on and then doing half the distance with them off. Wearing flippers forces you to kick in a better flutter kick position because you need to relax your legs to move. Ive had many students that have improved their kicking after wearing flippers.

1788,"I personally do.

I learn things that aren't directly applicable to my job though. If it's for my company, I do the learning on the company clock. If it's out of my own curiosity or for a side-project, then I'm more than happy to do that on my own time.

It's to learn whatever I need to know in order to do one of my side projects. I guess you could consider that passion, but I consider it necessity. The basis for the side-projects themselves is I want to solve problems I have and/or make money. My dream is to quit my job and live off passive-income from my suite of mobile apps. I'm about 1/10th of the way there.

I don't learn on a schedule or anything, I'm not spending 1 hour per day learning to make myself competitive. If I feel like working on my side projects then I work on them. When I have an idea I don't know how to do, I learn how to do it. Sometimes I don't do any work for a month, sometimes I do extra work every day for a month.

1791,"Men have to impress women to have sex with them, that part is true and I agree that it is based in biology. The part that I'm actually talking about and where you and I seem to be diverging is the manner in which men impress the women, and that humans have moved beyond other animals so the women need to be somewhat impressive to the men as well. To begin with, if you ignore personal preference, what is actually impressive to a woman depends in part on her culture. In some places being strong and dominating everyone else is desirable, but in other places being polite and compromising is the way to go, just for example. 

Then there is how you meet potential partners. Let's take America as an example because Bill Maher is from there. One of the most popular ways to meet people you might like to have sex with is to go to a pub or club. If you're a man, you look around and find a girl you like the look of, then you go over to her, dance a bit perhaps, start a conversation, buy her a drink. If you're lucky, she will be keen enough on you to leave together. If she's not interested, you find another girl and try again until someone says yes. 

Now, what do you do if you're a woman? You look around and you see a guy you like the look of and then... that's it, you don't do anything else except maybe flutter your eyelashes at him every once in a while and hope that he decides to try chatting you up eventually. In the meantime you get drinks bought for you by guys you have zero intention of leaving with and eventually either the guy you like finally tries it on with you, or you go home.

Why doesn't the girl just talk to the guy if she likes the look of him? That's how it works for animals, a male looks pretty and catches the female's attention so she stops to have a better look and he sweet-talks her into mating. It is in a human woman's best interest, biologically speaking, to chat guys up she likes the look of instead of doing nothing and hoping for the best. And what is the reason men have to do all the pursuing and women wait to be pursued? Cultural rules for ""proper"" behaviour and stigma. ",2018-06-12 14:31:23

Clearly the passionate love your mom felt for her ex wasnt the end-all-be-all to the perfect relationship, since they divorced.

I would have had you doing anything I wanted within days, if not hours, if I'd chosen you.  You know the way you just felt when you read ""chosen you""?  It might have been buried because you're making such an effort to be a better woman, but if so look at your feelings honestly and thoroughly, and you'll find the feeling I'm talking about.  That feeling gives incredible power to the man that knows it's there, and wants to use it.  Are you already imagining what exciting things I might have made you do, and how good it would feel to show me that you were willing to do them for me?  Are you already imagining what I might do if you were willing, compliant, obedient?   Did any of those words just now make your heart flutter?

You are looking for something permanent, and perfect, from mortal, flawed, fallen men.   I could never give you what it is you're seeking, and no man can.  But I could very easily make you believe that I can give you that permanent and perfect thing, and that I am what you've always thought.  Yes, I could convince you to put me in God's place in your life.

I was wicked.  This was my greatest sin - that I would to strive to supplant God in the lives of others.

It seems like you've recognized, objectively, that the thing you're seeking is God, and that all these desires are distractions from Him, but that you struggle to place good things and good desires in their proper order and place in your life.  Thank God immensely for the gift of intelligence and wisdom that has afforded you this understanding, because without it you would be in a very dark place.

I suggest foscusing your prayers on Our Lady's intercession, asking her to obtain for you the gift of peace.  Let yourself be quieted, and ask her to help that quiet come about within you.  Sit still, spiritually speaking, take in your arms all of these feelings that pull you in every direction, and rob you of peace, and gather them up together into your heart.  Your heart will feel strained, like it cannot hold all of this. Then entirely give your heart and all it contains to your Holy Mother, and ask her to obtain for you, from her divine Son, a clean heart that desires Him above all else, and that from within this clean heart peace will radiate throughout your being.   Through Mary, give to God all these stresses, and all of this noise, and focusing all your many longings now onto this singular desire, beg that in return He give you His peace.

Anyway a drill I like to do is kick off the wall while streamlined (head over head, arm over arm, slight posterior tilt) and play with my head position while noting the effect of it on my overall balance, length I travel, leg position, etc. So this can be done with multiple kickoffs and no kick, but expect your feet to sink when you're out of momentum.


Alternatively you can do something similar with a flutter kick. In this case I prefer to be on my side with on arm extended forward and experiment with how much pressure I apply with my armpit (pressing down, that is).

1810,"While many people do overcome and adapt to VR sickness it isn't true for everyone. I've only ever lasted a couple minutes using smooth locomotion and then I have to set aside the headset *for hours* to recover. I *can* sometimes handle cockpit games though - truck simulator is fine (as long as it can maintain 45fps) but Dirt Rally made me sick in 2 minutes. :(

A number of people have said that Fallout 4 VR's artificial motion doesn't cause VR sickness. I couldn't handle more than a couple minutes.

You tend not to get motion sickness in car because you both see *and* feel motion; while some people get motion sick looking ahead in many cases it's due to looking at something which doesn't move - e.g. a book or phone, instead of the world around you.

Cockpits help in VR because your immediate surroundings don't move; it's more like watching things on a TV; e.g. Elite Dangerous is fine for me although that's a bad comparison as objects are distant making their impact on feelings of motion minimal (... though interestingly entering a station would actually make my stomach flutter when not using VR, but that's due to triple-wide displays giving much more peripheral vision compared to the goggle effect of VR HMDs)

1813,"I have a serious medical condition that caused my heart to stop dead in its tracks. I had passed out before I knew what was happening, so I couldn't tell you how that felt. I got a pacemaker/defibrillator soon after and was released. I've never had my heart stop again, but several times since that initial episode I've experienced close calls...

Back in 2009, around February I think, my city got some crazy snowfall we weren't expecting. I mean, we were only 5 hours north of the Gulf of Mexico, so it was uncharacteristic. My cousin and I were out playing in the snow, pelting each other with packed snowballs like normal 17/18 year-olds do, when I felt my pacemaker start to pace my heart. You know how it feels when you're scared awake from a deep sleep and you can feel your heart pounding/fluttering in your chest? That's how a pacemaker stimulating your heart feels.

I always hated that feeling - same reason I hate scary movies - so I noticed it immediately and stopped. I told my cousin to stop too. He thought I was kidding or trying to trick him until all of the sudden my back arched and I spasmed to the ground. It was the defibrillator that time, discharging a electricity through my heart.

I told my cousin to go get my sister so we could drive to the hospital. While he was running off to get her, I stayed in the snow on my hands and knees, spasming every thirty seconds or so as my defibrillator shocked my still-beating heart.

It was only about two or three minutes that I was being defibrillated, but it felt like an eternity. I crawled to the parking lot nearby and sat against the wheel well of someone's SUV wondering if I was going to die here. Seven times my device had discharged to this point; did that mean it couldn't get my heart to recover? Is this snowy parking lot in an apartment complex really going to be where it ends? Fuck, that's not fair... I'm only 17.

But that's where the defibrillation stopped. My sister was too terrified to drive, so we waved down a passing car. The woman was confused, but she was incredibly kind. She drove us there and refused gas money. I saw the doctor and, wouldn't you know? When I'd gotten my device replaced the year prior, they hadn't set the thresholds on it properly. It detected my raised heart rate from playing in the snow and thought I was having an episode. I was never in any danger...

1816,"A man wakes up in a dingy slum, with no memory of how he got there. He wanders around aimlessly before he finds even one person who will talk to him. Some ratty beggar on the street turns out to be nice enough to explain where he is.

""You're in the afterlife!"" he tells the man, ""But you must have been a real shithead when you were alive, because this is the fourth ring, and only the worst people come here.""

All of a sudden, a siren goes off, one of those air\-raid things. The man is terrified but the beggar gets up calmly and leads him to a big, dilapidated warehouse where thousands of other similarly unkempt souls are gathering. When the man asks why they're all here, the beggar points to a line of folding tables against the wall. Each table has some moldy bread, cups of dingy water, and some bowls of broth so thin they could have just run out of cups. Only then does the man realize how hungry he is. A guard in heavy body armor blows a whistle and all the people arrange themselves into three lines.

The beggar is helpful enough to explain them for the man. ""That one's the bread line, that's the broth line, and that's the water line. All the food here is free, but if you want to get out of this maggot hole, you've got to work, because the gate guards into the third ring ask five hundred dollars to get through. I've heard the food is better there.""

So the man gets his food. It's abominable, and right then and there, he vows to make five hundred dollars and get into the third ring. Unfortunately for him, very few people need work in the afterlife, especially when all of them are saving up to emigrate. Even still, after ten years of hard work, eating the moldy bread and indistinguishable soup and water, he finally saves up enough money. The guards let him through and he finds himself in the third ring. It's nothing too fancy, if anything, it's a bit below average for a real city, but to his eyes it is paradise. All the guards look much friendlier, and the houses and buildings, while not spacious or lavish, are at least up to code. And to his surprise, he runs right into a familiar former beggar as he crosses the street.

""What are the odds?"" they both ask and they get to conversing. The beggar, it turns out, only managed to make it in himself a few months back. Their conversation is interrupted, however, by what sounds like a school bell. When the man seems confused, the beggar leads him to what looks like a giant gymnasium. Here, people are gathering once again, and the man begins to understand. On a line of folding tables against one wall are stacks of hot dogs, big bowls of salad, and solo cups full of fresh lemonade. A cop shouts for everyone's attention and directs them all to stand in three lines. The beggar smiles at the man's wonder and points to each line in turn. ""That's the hot dog line, that's the salad line, and that's the lemonade line."" The man gets in each line in turn and gets himself his lunch.

While he's eating, basking in joy at not being stuck with old bread and water, the beggar encourages him, ""The best part is, halfway through the year, they switch from hot dogs, salad, and lemonade to chicken, chili, and hot chocolate. You can never get tired of it!""

Sadly, this proved not to be true. After only a few days, the man did again get tired of the same meal every day. But he knew firsthand that he could change his lot, so one day he went up to the wall of the second circle. This time the guards were asking for ten thousand dollars. Well, the man didn't like it, but he figured he had his whole afterlife ahead of him now that he was out of the fourth circle, and he could certainly take some time to save up. After ten years of hard work, it wasn't too difficult for him to keep up the work ethic, and only twenty years later, he went back to the guards of the second ring with the money in hand. He went through the gate and found himself in a glittering, clean city full of glass and steel.

And wouldn't you know it, but there, standing across the street was the same beggar, only now he was wearing a well\-fitted suit. The man greeted the beggar as an old friend and they started talking again. Once again, their conversation was interrupted, only this time it was by beautiful church bells. ""Come,"" the beggar told him, ""I'll take you to the evening meal."" So the man followed and they entered a glamorous ballroom filled with beautiful attendees. Even the cops here looked good, dressed in suits and sunglasses like bodyguards. And sure enough, piled onto platters on huge mahogany tables against the far wall were plates of steak, bowls of the most delicious seafood soups, and glasses of champagne. One of the bodyguards cleared his throat loudly and politely requested that the attendees line up. Three lines were formed and the beggar pointed each line out in turn. ""That's the steak line, that's the soup line, and that's the champagne line,"" and then he added, ""and apparently here, they change the meals FOUR times a year!""

The man rejoiced, ate, and was happy, and for once felt that nothing was lacking. Four changes a year was enough for him. But one day, out of curiosity, he went up to the bodyguards that guarded the gate into the first and final ring of the afterlife and found they were asking for a million dollars to pass. Well the man was a bit disturbed by this, after all, the second ring seemed perfect to him. ""What is it,"" he thought, ""that could possibly be more wonderful than what I have here?"" That question haunted him for weeks until he came to a conclusion. He was used to working hard and he had all of eternity to save up, so he wanted, just once to see what he could possibly be missing in the first ring.

Fifty years later, he returned to the guards with a million dollars. When he stepped into the first ring he fell to his knees. The architecture was glorious and inhuman, and the bodyguard had turned into shining angels. To his surprise, someone helped him up off the street and when he looked, he realized he recognized who it was\-\-it was the beggar he met in the fourth ring, adorned in a golden robe and glowing, and when he looked down at himself he realized he looked much the same.

The beggar laughed jovially. ""I got here only three years ago myself, but somehow I knew you would be right here behind me. I've come back to this gate every day waiting for you to make it in!"" Suddenly, the air was filled with the sound of angelic choirs and the beggar led the man off to a gigantic palace made of crystal and cloud. The room was filled with radiant citizens of the first circle and angels prepared everything. Sure enough, there was a line of massive altars against one wall, spilling over with glistening golden dragon meat, a pudding refined from clouds and dew and silk, and an ice cold tub of ambrosia and nectar ladled out individually into blindingly beautiful crystalline chalices. An angel fluttered from the ceiling and bowed silently to the assembled mass, who bowed respectfully back and then broke themselves into their lines on their own.

Smiling at the tradition, the beggar pointed to the first line. ""That's the line for the dragon meat,"" he said before turning to the next line, ""and that's the line for angel dust stew,"" then he paused, confused.

""What is it?"" the man asked his old friend.

The beggar replied, ""There appears to be no [punchline](https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/4uplec/a_man_wakes_up_in_a_dingy_slum/).""",2018-06-12 18:57:09

1818,"The Mighty Italian Empire fell disastrously in 1945, when fascist dictator Benito Mussolini was executed by American and British soldiers on a Sunday morning, on a small hill outside of Rome. World War Two would end in a matter of months, and when the second great war was finally over, Italy was in a rough predicament.

	Much of the old empire, including its overseas territories were intact, and still belonged to Italy. Italy did not want to lose them. America, however, was worried that the Italian State would become fascist again, or worst, fall to the communists who had already taken East Germany. In 1946, a constitution was signed, creating the *Federated Italian States*. 4 regions (Italy, Libya, Ethiopia, and Somaliland) consisting of 14 states (Italy, Corsica and Sardinia, Albania, Crete and Cyprus, Tunis, Tripolitania, Cyrenaica, Italian West Egypt, Eritrea, Amhara, Galla Sidamo, Ethiopia, and Somaliland).
	
	The Pan-African Railway was a major connector between the 4 regions. Built in 1918, it was revolutionary for its time. It increased trade, travel, immigration, and much more. It was much easier, and cheaper, than sending cruise ships through the Suez, a very dangerous place at the time. However, over the years, neglect and sabotage led the railway to become a decrepit reminder of the once powerful Italian Empire.

	The height of the federation was in 1952. Later this year, Crete, Cyprus, Italian West Egypt, and Tunis would all declare independence. The last remnants of the Empire would flutter away, when Albania would declare independence in 1963, Italy being left with the islands of Corsica and Sardinia.

	As most of the states had left, Italy changed their name to The Republic of Italy in 1970.

1822,"I wouldnt worry about the snakes or the frogs! .......its the Alphas that should trouble you.....we went weeks without ever seeing one, we had built such a quaint, warming hovel to eek out a simple existence. Our Dinos were safe within our wooden walls, we even took care to surround the place in spikes of hide and wood! 

Then came the reckoning....

It began with a frightened parasaur making a mad dash through our lawn just in front of the gate, it was covered in cuts and bleeding everywhere as it wailed and ran for the coast! 

Similar wails could be heard just over the hill, in the direction of the small mountain where we gathered metal and crystal. The was were soon followed by an orange glow. There were but one of our tribe awake to see the Aloha Raptor crest the hill and make his way to our walls. 

Our Dinos nervously fluttered this way and that way attracting the attention of the orange glowing demon. Once he was close enough he was pricked by one of our spikes, that was all it took, the raptor raged and ferociously attacked our spikes and our simple home. 

Our lone tribemate climbed high and let fly with every arrow and spear our simple structures held, the raptor fought on. He made splinters of our spikes and dust of our walls. Our tribe mate picked up his phone and woke us from our slumber.

We all tried in vain to sate the monsters hunger but to no avail. He had his way and moved on towards the coast to continue his plague and wreak havoc elsewhere. 

We lost over 30 loyal dinosaurs that day, we made a remembrance wall with all of their names, its still hard to talk about.

1825,"Haggard  was a fat giant of a man. He towered over his students at nine 9feet tall. Hermione watched in awe as he guided his students  into the magical creature pen just outside his wooden hut. 
""Right, ladies! T'day we're gunna lern aboot Brarhead Hoonds! Tern to page 69 of yer textbooks!"" 
There was a flutter of paper  as students opened their books.  A Japanese girl to Hermione's right raised her hand. 
""P-Professor? Do you mean, Braehead Hounds?"" 
""Aye, chinky,"" Haggard replied, ""Thas what I said - Brarhead Hoonds.""
There was a pause  as Haggard opened the gate. Two excited Braehead Hounds leapt and barked.
""Ahh need two 2volunteers!"" Haggard boomed. 
He scratched his beard and looked at the class before suddenly pointing at Hermione. 
""Whoremione! You'll do! And I need one more... Oy! Slanty eyes! You're up as well! Get in the pen!"" 
Hermione and the Japanese  girl stood up and stepped into the Braehead Hounds'  pen.
""Now, girls. These are magical creechurs. Yeh have to be be very careful because these are horny dogs! I'm gunna teach yeh how to handle them safely!""
Haggard then closed the gate and locked it shut. 
Ring ring   
""Aww shit, that's mah phone.  I'll be back faster than Congress  can impeach Trump.""   
Haggard wandered off, leaving the girls locked inside the wooden fence with the Hounds while the class watched.  Suddenly the Braehead Hounds  began to walk towards the girls!
""G-good d-doggy..."" the Japanese  girl whimpered, stepping back and raising open palms.  
Suddenly, one of the Hounds  leapt at her, knocking her onto her back. She landed on the ground, her schoolgirl skirt lifting up to reveal her panties. Hermione watched as the Japanese  girl's arms sank into the muddy earth.  She struggled to stand back up - but her arms were completely stuck! 
The Braehead Hound  wasted no time ploughing its snout  between her yellow thighs. It's sharp teeth quickly found her cotton panties and chewed them off, exposing her virgin pussy to the entire class!
""N-Noooo!"" she screamed.
Hermione panicked as the second Hound turned to face her. In a frantic flurry she made a dash  for the wooden fence. There was a small crack between the planks - maybe enough for Hermione to squeeze through. She could hear the Hound chasing her!
""Ah! Dammit!"" Hermione cried.
She had tried to dive through the gap, but she had only managed to get her upper half through the hole. She was stuck waist down in the pen. No matter how she struggled and wriggled, the little witch couldn't break free.
She frantically searched for her wand,  grabbing it from her cloak's pocket. As she lifted the magical stick to cast a spell it was snatched from her hand! 
""Sorry, does this belong to you, Whoremione?"" Muffloy jeered.
The Slither-in student had stolen her only defence against the Hound.
""Give that back!"" Hermione yelled.
""No, I think the class would rather watch what happens next, you filthy mudblood."" 
The Japanese  girl's arms were still stuck in the thick muddy soil. The Braehead Hound  had buried its head between her thighs now. Its long, wet  tongue  was repeatedly caressing her virgin slit, lapping up her teenage juices. 
""Ah! Ah! Ahhh! St-stooohhhhp! Ayaaaaahhhhhh!""
The Hound slurped and slobbered    at her cunt, its hot tongue  driving her  with unwanted pleasure. Her little clitoris  was burning with each graze of the beast's  talented muscle. 
""Oh!!! Ohhhhh! I'm cuuummmmmiing!"" she screamed, her body convulsing. 
She shook and thrashed near-uncontrollably. The unwanted orgasm rocked her body to its core. But the Hound  wasn't finished yet - it continued licking  even after she had finished.
""W-Wait! Ahhh! T-too sensitive!!!! Ooooohhhh! Ahhhhhhhh!!!""
Hermione was not having much luck  either. The second Hound had placed its paws upon her back in an attempt to mount her. It's hard, eight 8inch shaft was already pressing up against her tight vulva  through her panties. It thrust forward as hard as it could, but the elastic panties refused to yield. 
""Oh! Ah! Bad dog! Ah!"" Hermione gasped.
She struggled to break free and keep her composure in front of her class. If she could only last until Haggard came back...
rrrrriiiipppp
""AHHHHHHH!""
Hermione's panties suddenly snapped and eight inches of doggy dick plunged into her soaking wet pussy.  
She felt it fill up her body, stretching her cunt with its thick cock. Almost immediately it began to thrust in and out at an inhumanly quick pace. 
""Ah! Ah! Ah!"" 
Her moans came fast. Too fast. She could barely catch her breath.  She curled her toes  as the pleasure spread like a plague  throughout her body. With each thrust her big breasts   swung back and forth.
She clenched her hands  and banged her fists  against the fence. Her efforts were fruitless though - she was well and truly stuck.
The Japanese  student had cum four 4times now. Her little mind was going blank as the hound's  unceasing tongue  never stopped licking.
""Aaaahhh! Oh yes!! Yesss!!! I'm a little doggy slut!!! Lick  my pussy  !"" she hollered, another orgasm washing through her body.
Hermione felt something thick begin to swell within her pussy. 
""Oh look,"" Muffloy laughed, ""it's knotting Whoremione!""
The swelling pushed up and stretched her pussy, placing an immense pressure upon her quivering g-spot. This was enough to drive  her over the edge.
""Oh! Oh fuck! I'm cummming! Nooooooohhhhhhh!!!""
Hermione's body betrayed her as she came. Seconds later she heard the Hound howl.
""Arroooooo!""
""No! Don't cum inside me!""
Hermione knew that many of the magical creatures in Haggard's class could impregnate girls. Right now was a very dangerous time of the month for her!
She felt a hot, goopy fluid rush into the depths of her pussy  and flood into her fertile womb. The sensation was enough to send a second orgasm through her teenage body. Already, the Hound's sperm were swimming towards her teenage eggs , seeking to fertilise them. As the Braehead Hound  continued to cum, the cum began to leak  out of her pussy  and trickle down her thighs.
""Hahaha!"" the class roared in laughter at the two girls' plight. 
""Looks like Whoremione is going to be a pregnant slut now!"" Muffloy jeered, egging the crowd on.
""N-noooooo! Get me out of the fence! I- ahhh- I need to get the cum out! Ooooh!""
After five minutes of pumping her pussy  full of cum,  the Hound finally released her, leaving her lower half drenched in thick white semen.  The Japanese  girl wasn't faring any better. The Hound  had finally left her alone - but she was still quivering on the ground in the aftershock of twelve 12consecutive orgasms.
Haggard returned four hours later - long enough for the Hounds to fuck the Japanese  girl, and for Hermione's tight little ass  to get flooded with doggy cum too.

""Oh bugger,"" mumbled Haggard, ""I've already hit mah allowed limit of eight impregnated students this month. The school nurse is gunna kill  me...""",2018-06-12 20:01:12
1826,"A laughing voice rings out from the shadows of the clearing, sending the fiery autumn leaves spinning in the wind.

""So this is who The Council has sent to attempt to defeat me? What a joke!"" The guffaws continue, though it is accented by footfalls, closing in, drawing ever closer. ""The great hero, armed with nothing but a hooded cloak and  a blade the size of a needle! This must be a jest.""

The hero, for his part, remains silent, holding his blade in front of him. The only acknowledgement that he's even heard his opponent is a baring of teeth, more snarl than smile. There's little more than a flowing of shadows along the clearing floor, and for the first time, the hooded mouse shows the first sign of impatience: he spins his blade and looks up, the hood falling backward, revealing a small head with silky pink ears and keen, bright eyes, the shiny red fur more reminiscent of a fox than a mouse.

""Why won't you come over here and find out?"" She speaks for the first time, eyes narrowed, sword thrust outward, almost as if to say, 'Come and try to best me, I dare you'. Armor made of a combination of dark, tightly knitted thread and reinforced tree bark with hardened sap over it. The girl mouse isn't sure how much protection it will provide, cobbled together as it was at the last minute, but she has been chosen, and she will not turn back, not until there is no other option.

She will fight for her people, her country, and the Council, even if it takes everything that she has to do so.

Finally, after what seems like an age, the other speaker emerges from the flora and fauna, still chortling merrily. ""The Council has surely lost its wits. Not that it had much to begin with."" The mouse tenses, resisting the urge to grind her teeth in frustration. She'd had enough of this posturing, and she was most anxious to get started. Even if the very thought of facing this beast terrified her more than anything she'd ever faced.

""Can we get on with this, please? The Council told me a lot of things about you, but not that you were so vocal,"" The mouse quips in return, leaning on her blade, trying to ignore the sensation of her heart racing inside of her chest, fluttering frantically at her throat.

The being laughed, at last stepping into the dying sunlight. The mouse grits her teeth to hold in a shocked gasp, and when it spreads its wings, it blocks the light, throwing the clearing into darkness. The beast grins, showing off a mouthful of long, pointed teeth that reminded her of needles. Its huge nostrils flare as it chuckles to itself again, blowing out a gust so powerful that the mouse is nearly knocked off of her feet.

A bat. Of all things, The Council had asked her to face off against a giant bat.

Why, exactly, had she agreed to this insanity again?

The thing that strikes her first about her opponent was the jeweled studs in its ears, the colors of blood and the night sky, naked of the jewelry the sky had lent it.

""Are you frightened, you little, tiny thing?"" The bat asks, tilting its great head to the side, bringing its face right up next to hers. She barely manages to hold in her flinch. ""What hope does a little insect such as yourself have against me? This is my territory, after all. Something I'm assuming The Council conveniently forgot to mention.""

""You're lying!"" She snarls back, puffing her chest and standing to her full height, which, granted, isn't much. ""The Council wouldn't lie to me like that!""

""I wouldn't be so sure, little mouse."" The bat sounds far from bored now; quite the opposite, and its eyes, glimmering in the black space like wet rubies, flash with something that the mouse can't identify, and doesn't like. ""You'd be surprised what knowledge is held back from those who use a person's duty and honor to serve their own ends.""

""What, pray tell, would you know about that, you great flapping beast? Look at you! You're a wreck.""

Much to her opponent's surprise, the bat laughed, a husky, rasping sound.

""Oh, my little spitfire, I know more about that than you think. I'll answer your questions, if you're willing to listen. What a little terror you are.""

The mouse frowned, all the fight leaving her body as quickly as it had come. So far, the bat had made no move to hurt her.

1836,"Reporters crowded into a Singapore auditorium Tuesday, expecting President Trump to walk out and announce the results of his historic meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

Suddenly, two huge screens on either side of the empty podium came to life. Soaring music boomed over the speakers, and the reporters were bombarded with a montage portraying North Korea as some sort of paradise.

Golden sunrises, gleaming skylines and high-speed trains. Children skipping through Kim Il Sung square in Pyongyang. North Korean flags fluttering between images of Egyptian pyramids, the Taj Mahal and the Lincoln Memorial.

In a split-screen shot, Kim Jong Un waved to an adoring crowd while President Trump stood beside him with his thumb in the air. The pair appeared over and over again, like running mates in a campaign video.

The film went on like this for more than four minutes, with brief interludes of missiles, soldiers and warships interrupting the pageantry. Some journalists, unable to understand the Korean-language narration, assumed they were watching one of Pyongyang's infamous propaganda films. What country are we in? asked a reporter from the filing center.

But then the video looped, playing this time in English. And then Trump walked onto the stage and confirmed what some had already realized.

The film was not North Korean propaganda. It had been made in America, by or on the orders of his White House, for the benefit of Kim.

I hope you liked it, Trump told the reporters. I thought it was good. I thought it was interesting enough to show. ... And I think he loved it.

The crowd sounded skeptical. Some wondered if Trump had not, in fact, just provided U.S.-sanctioned propaganda to one of the country's oldest adversaries.

But as the president explained it, the video was more like an elevator pitch. It was the type of glitzy production that Trump might have once used to persuade investors to finance his hotels, and now hoped could persuade one of the most repressive regimes in the world to disarm its nuclear weapons and end nearly 70 years of international isolation and militant hostility to the United States.

The nearly five-minute movie even had its own Hollywood-style vanity logo: A Destiny Pictures Production, though a film company by the same name in Los Angeles denied any involvement in making it, and the White House has not yet responded to questions about it.

Of those alive today, only a small number will leave a lasting impact, the narrator said near the beginning, as alternating shots of Trump, Kim and North Korean pageantry flashed on the screen. And only a very few will make decisions or take actions to renew their homeland, or change the course of history.

The message was clear: Kim had a decision to make. Then the film progressed from grim black-and-white shots of the United States' 1950s-era war with North Korea into a montage of rose-colored parades and gold-tinted clouds.

The past doesn't have to be the future, the narrator said. What if a people that share a common and rich heritage can find a common future?

The same technique repeated even more dramatically a minute later in the film, when the footage seemed to melt into a horror montage of war planes and missiles bearing down on North Korean cities  much like the apocalyptic propaganda videos Pyongyang had produced just a few months ago, when Kim and Trump sounded as if they were on the brink of nuclear war.

But in Trump's film, the destruction rewound itself. The missiles flew back into to their launchers, and a science fiction-like version of North Korea took its place  one of crane-dotted skylines, crowded highways, computerized factories and drones, all presided over by a waving, grinning Kim.

You can have medical breakthroughs, an abundance of resources, innovative technology and new discoveries, the narrator said, the footage more and more resembling a Hollywood movie trailer as it built to its finale:

Featuring President Donald Trump and Chairman Kim Jong Un in a meeting to remake history, the narrator concluded, as Korean words flashed on a black background: It is going to become a reality?

The reporters had many questions.

Do you now see Kim Jong Un as an equal? asked a Time magazine correspondent.

In what way? Trump asked.

You just showed a video that showed you and Kim Jong Un on equal footing, and discussing the future of the country.

The president may have misunderstood the question, as he referred in his answer to his closed-door talks and a few carefully negotiated photo ops with Kim  not the U.S.-made video that presented the totalitarian autocrat as a hero.

If I have to say I'm sitting on a stage with Chairman Kim and that gets us to save 30 million lives  it could be more than that  I'm willing to sit on a stage, I'm willing to travel to Singapore, very proudly, Trump said.

Are you concerned the video you just showed could be used by Kim as propaganda, to show him as ...

Trump cut the question off. No, I'm not concerned at all. We can use that video for other countries.

The president was more talkative when discussing how Kim had reacted to the video, which Trump had presumably played for him during a brief, private meeting hours earlier.

We didnt have a big screen like you have the luxury of having, Trump said. We didn't need it, because we had it on cassette, uh, an iPad.

And they played it. About eight of their representatives were watching it, and I thought they were fascinated by it. I thought it was well done. I showed it to you because that's the future. I mean, that could very well be the future. And the other alternative is just not a very good alternative. It's just not good.

International reviews of the video were decidedly mixed.

""Odd.""  [The Canadian Broadcasting Corp.](http://www.cbc.ca/news/thenational/national-today-newsletter-trump-kim-video-daimler-nobel-1.4695467)

""One observer dismissed it as 'a word salad topped with gratuitous appeasement of a monstrous regime,'"" [the South China Morning Post reported](http://www.scmp.com/news/asia/diplomacy/article/2150486/trump-kim-co-star-us-made-summit-film-mixing-propaganda).

The Daily Mail [noted](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5834437/They-great-beaches-Trump-showed-Kim-iPad-video-North-Koreas-future.html) that as the narrator described North Korea's glorious future of  technology and international investment, the video showed stock footage of the Miami Beach shoreline, not far from a Trump-owned hotel. The Spectator called the whole sequence [""real-estate politik""](https://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2018/06/donald-trumps-real-estate-politik-is-working/)  which wasn't necessarily a bad thing.

""The text reads like some godawful martial-arts movie trailer crossed with a corporate advertisement for an ambitious construction project,"" Freddy Gray wrote for the British newspaper. ""But clearly, in some peculiar way, it works.""

The president acknowledged that some of the film's imagery may seem far-fetched. North Korea is mired in poverty, internationally isolated, and has been mismanaged for decades by a family of dictators  Kim, his father and grandfather.

That was done at the highest level of future development, Trump told the reporters in Singapore, as if he had just offered Kim a multi-tiered vacation package. I told him, you may not want this. You may want to do a much smaller version. ... You may not want that, with the trains and everything.

He waved his hands. You know, with super everything, to the top. It's going to be up to them.""

And then, in his usual style, Trump was thinking out loud about the great condos that might one day be built on the great beaches of North Korea.

I explained it, he said. You could have the best hotels in the world. Think of it from the real estate perspective.

As the screens above Trump emphasized, he certainly had.",2018-06-12 20:57:37

The hands that were shaking not too long ago finally, but faintly, clenched the glorious flavoured tortilla chip; sauntering the crisp with graceful elegance towards my face. My heart started to flutter faster and faster; my pupils dilated as the crisp touched my lips. The Dorito was slowly going in, but it was surely making an impression on my taste buds.

The savoury Nacho melted onto my quenchless tongue. I let out a groan of satisfaction when it emerged fully into my mouth; every nerve ending of my body released an unfamiliar tingle. My hands wrap themselves into a ball of what appeared to be a giant cheese ball; my head flails back with cheesy-goodness. This crisp was no ordinary crisp. This crisp was the one.

Before I could even flood my true love with my undying emotions, it was gone. My tongue frantically searches for it, but alas, the Dorito has dissolved.

I jump with my arms out in the open towards the bag; my mouth yelling out for its love.

1870,"You open the second stall and you are immediately met with quite the spectacle. A naked futa punker is sitting on the toilet, her hands cuffed to a pipe behind her head. She is sweaty, shaking and her cock is visibly throbbing in the air, leaking pre-cum. The punkers eyes light up as you enter the stall and her breath hitches in her throat.


Oh-h thank the goddess youve come! She exclaims with shaky breath, audibly anxious. My mates cuffed me here for losing a bet a-and now I think they k-kinda forgotten about me. She explains and bucks her hips in frustration. They left me the key but- She thrusts up with her cock, showing off said key dangling from a piercing under her cockhead. Its sort of out of my hands...
She gives you a puppy-eyed look and softly begs. Would you help me out? Please.?


It looks like you have a choice. You could just slip out of the stall and let her be someone elses problem  its not like she could do anything about it. But leaving her here for who knows how long, cuffed and naked when you can help her just seems too cruel to you. On the other hand her restlessly throbbing cock and the way she almost absent-mindedly bucks her hips every few seconds makes you think that freeing her might not be the best idea.

REFUSE

Sorry, you hastily apologize and quickly exit the stall, leaving the futa behind. You hear her call after you a few times but her voice is quickly drowned by the clubs music once you get further away from the stall.

ACCEPT

Okay, you decide to help the futa out. She gasps happily and bites her lip. Thank you, thank you, thank you! She exclaims happily. She then goes on and spreads her legs wide apart, giving you easy access to the key while simultaneously presenting her crotch to you in all its glory.


You gulp nervously at the substantial sight before you and beads of sweat start to run down your neck.
You decide to get it over with quickly so you step forward and carefully get your hands on the key. As cautious and precise as you are you still arent able to get the key off without brushing your fingers against the punkers stiff and sweaty cock-head. Every time you do so the futa bites her lip and with her eyes fluttering she tries, unsuccessfully, to suppress her throaty moans. After some ordeal which includes getting your fingers wet with precum you finally get the key off.


Yay! She rejoices happily and fidgets in her seat. You reach out behind her to unlock the cuffs, pressing intimately close to her in the process. Her cock brushes against your own crotch and as you lean in further it slips across the underside of your crotch and flops against your backside. Upsies She giggles and blushes rather adorably. Even through the fabric of your clothes you still feel the warmth of her member pulsate against your ass.


Finally you manage to unlock the cuffs and they click open. Oh thank you! She voices joyfully and you help her get the cuffs off her wrists. Thank you so much handsome savior! She expresses her gratitude by getting up and hugging you tightly, her rigid cock pressing against your abdomen. She pulls back to look at you and the lustful look in her hooded eyes clearly tells you whats gonna happen next.


She rips your shorts off your body with surprising speed and spinning you around she presses you against the wall of the bathroom. Im so sorry for this I really am, she apologizes with genuine regret audible in her voice. But Ive been here so long, she slips her cock across your ass crack, leaving it wet with her precum, I got so pent up. She presses the tip of her cock against your ass and leans against your back, whispering in your ear, so full.


With a swift thrust she buries herself in your ass, making you yelp in pain with tears swelling in your eyes. Shhh, its gonna be alright soon. She coos and reaches down to your shamefully erect dick, jerking it as she slowly slides further inside you. Here let me make it better. It does and soon the mix of pain and pleasure makes you moan instead of cry.


Good boy, she praises you with a grin but thats the last you hear from her in a while as she start picking up speed and humping you like a dog in a heat. She presses hard against you in every way, your insides stretched by her meaty cock and your body squeezed by her tight grip. She fucks you mercilessly, bucking her hips with swift thrusts that make her heavy ballsack slap against your own.


Those slaps along with her pistoning cock and her jerking hand still on your dick makes you lightheaded as she breeds you. The punker makes you her bitch as she bites your neck and ear, leaving you a moaning leaking mess. She gives out guttural grunts as she pounds your ass, her thrusts becoming sloppy and unfocused. You feel her hot breath on your ear as she leans in and whispers. Im gonna paint your insides in my nut-soup. Youre gonna drain my balls of all my nut-butter, wont you?


You manage nothing else than a moan and she grips you by the hair, pulling your head back. Im gonna blow my load in your gut now, show me you want it! With that she bites down on your neck and frantically thumbs the underside of your dickhead. You cry out and spray the wall under you in your cum, your balls expelling your worthless male seed to be wasted on the ground.


Good boy now take my ball-juice babe! She pulls back and grabbing you firmly by your hips she thrusts inside you with full force. The force applied on your prostate makes you erupt again and she isnt far behind. She grunts deeply and buries her face in your shoulder while her swollen balls pull up against her body, ready to expel their creamy content.


It doesnt take long and she blasts her first rope of come inside your guts, the haze immediately hits you and makes you cum again, your cock twitching out a dry orgasm. She doesnt stop though and her fertile futa balls pump more and more seed down her shaft, letting it spray your insides. You press your face against the wall in post-orgasmic bliss as the punkers swelled cock still fills you with more of her warm ball-juice.


Your stomach begins to swell slightly from the amount she has deposited inside you, her fat cock blocking any chance of even a drop escaping. She is still at it grunting and rutting inside you like an animal, shooting more cock-snot inside your gut with each second. This is why so many males have fallen for futas, you think. The clear dominance, the power, the primal feeling of submissing to an alpha and letting them breed you.


You doubt that the spermicide you took will be enough to get you out of this haze. She finally stops blasting more cum inside you and leans against you, panting heavily. I really needed that, she admits and slowly slides her cock out of you, her cum leaking down your thighs. Thank you for helping me out babe, but she turns you around and brings you to your knees, her cock still stiff. I am not done with you yet.


As you lean in and willingly take her inside your mouth and feel her hand on the back of your head, you are sure you found your place in life. And truly you did, after this evening you were so used up to even be able to stand, some futas running the club found you in the bathroom and seeing your absolute addiction to futa cum they made you their new glory hole slut.

One day when I was opening the store, I was turning stuff on like usual. As I was hanging up the deployment chart, I felt the sleeve of my shirt move and heard a wooshing noise. I though the girl that was suppose to work drive thru had come in and walked past me but I just didn't hear her come in, so I turned around to say hi. Literally nobody was in the fucking store except me. I almost shit my pants.

Another shift manager said when he opened the store, he has heard foot steps behind him and when as he was walking out of the men's bathroom, he heard a really loud woman's scream in the women's bathroom. He ran into the bathroom but nobody was there. Later, when the assistant manager came in, he had her check the camera, and at the moment he heard the scream, all of the motion detectors in the cameras 'sensed' something and started recording. The camera by the back door area caught a black transparent upper half of a figure wooshing by and the papers on the wall fluttered.

The same assistant says she hates opening now because of what happened to the shift manager. Plus she says she hears people shuffling and mumbling up by the front counter a lot.

I wake up Ella and Elliot and whisper to them that it is time to wash up. I watch as they slowly peel themselves off the mattress then groggily proceed toward the sink to wash their faces with the 3-day old water. I feel my heart begin to mend as I once again realize the sadness of their livesparentless. Fortunately, while I was growing up my mother was still around, but for then she was slaughtered to death by these guerrilla forces from the West.

I quickly pushed away the thought of my parents, ensuring to not become forlorn in this lifetime war. Those that are the weakest and most sensitive are the most apt for death. I solidified my heart and went upstairs so I can watch over the updates of todays battle. 

I pulled the old beige curtain a little bit and sat in the windowsill where my face and body could not be seen. I watched as massive green tanks trudged through the dirt, climbing over skeletons and rubble from the destroyed homes. I know soon enough that these tanks will reach this home and this family will be eternally destroyed. I keep working with the misconception that they will be fooled by the disguise that no one lives here. However, they will know that someone does.

I dozed off a little bit on the windowsill and suddenly woke up to my Ella tugging at my dress, handing me a bowl of soup. 

Its quiet today Ella. I told her as I slurped from the slightly warm bowl she handed me.

Good. Its working then, she said turning around to return downstairs.

I peered out the window a little more to understand why there havent been any bombs or gunshots fired yet. 

Just then a soldier dressed in a green uniform stained with blood walked out of his tank and began to march toward our home. I rose from the windowsill, feeling my heart pump blood faster than it could be oxygenated. The soldier stopped in his tracks and I felt an aching feeling that he would pull out his gun. However, he started to choke on the air and was frantically fluttering his arms to try and catch his breath. He fell to the ground and a trail of blood leaked from his open mouth.

What the

Other soldiers scurried to help him but they too were asphyxiated by the air and fell to death. 

I stormed downstairs and went and reached for the doorknob to see what was going on.

Dont! I heard Ella and Elliot say.

I originally wanted Fluttershy to use German in reference to the Early Disney Princesses, the ones who flit around and animals follow wherever they go; they were originally written by the Grim Brothers, who were also German. But then I heard the screams of the Finnish Dub so I decided for Finnish instead.

Frankly speaking I think German dub in MLP is not bad but then again I hear so much German in my LWA project that I feel a little turned off about it. Still I will use German for other ponies like all the dubs available. That is if I can even find whole Episodes with all Dubs available.",2018-06-13 06:53:10

1911,"The Genie raised a blue eyebrow.

""10,000 hours stock market experience?""

""Yup,"" I replied, folding my arms and trying to make myself taller. I'd always been tempted to trade, always wanted to 'make it', but never dared. I didn't know what I was doing when it came to stocks. Truth be told, I didn't even get what stocks were. I just knew the people who knew how to trade and did it well made big money, got hot girls and fast cars.

""Whatever man, its your wish,"" said the Genie, shrugging his gigantic shimmering shoulders and pulling out a stone tablet.

""What, you don't like my wish?"" I asked, standing on tiptoes and raising my chin to peer over the edge of the tablet. It looked like a computer screen on the top side of the stone, and the Genie was typing '10,000' into one box of a 'wish submission' page. He clicked on a drop down box next to it, and a vast list of time units appeared. I cursed as a saw 'months', 'years', 'centuries' and 'eternities' available to select. ""You think 10,000 hours isn't big enough?""

""Well, yeah,"" said the Genie, pausing as his finger hovered over another box. He looked up at me and lowered the tablet. ""Obviously you could have asked for 10,000 lifetimes of experience, but it's more the subject. Stock Market is just gambling really. Computers can predict patterns, and maybe you will be able to get some right, but it's not a certainty. There's still risk involved. Not to mention you have no capital to start with. No initial investment.""

""I've got some money,"" I said defensively.

""You've got $48 dollars in your bank account.""

""I get paid next week!""

""Your existing debts account for 70% of your monthly outgoings.""

""I'll remortgage the house then! Or take out a loan!""

The Genie sighed, jewels glittering and clanging together as he shook his blue head. ""I just don't get why you wouldn't wish for money. A billion dollars or something.""

""Hmm,"" I replied, my cheeks beginning to burn. Now he mentioned it, that did kind of make sense.

The Genie brought up his tablet again. I gazed sadly at the screen, and noticed the last drop down box hadn't been touched. It was still blank. The screen read *I, Genie, hereby grant the user '10,000' 'Years' experience in his chosen field of '______' *

The Genie hovered his hand over the 'grant wish' button. ""Now that I think about it,"" he said with a pitying look, ""this is probably the worst, most pointless wish I've ever granted.""

""Hey, wait,"" I said as the Genie lowered his finger to press the button. ""you havent-""

""It's too late to change it now!"" laughed the Genie.

With that, he pressed the button.

There was a pause, filled only by the fluttering of my eyelashes and the patronising glare of the Genie. Somehow I knew enough about body language to know he was preparing to mock me. It took my brain a moment to adjust, and although I felt well versed in insults, deflection, social cues and the art of conversation, I said nothing. I felt well versed in everything, in fact, and allowed myself to reflect and meditate during the pause.

""Ready to make your money then?"" said the Genie, his sly smile widening. I knew enough about vocal inflection, emotional expressions and eye contact to know he was enjoying himself and thought he had the upper hand. ""Stock Brocker Extraordinaire?""

His shoulders quivered with a chuckle I wasn't meant to catch, but I did. I smiled back. I knew enough about Genie conduct and ethics that the wish had been granted incorrectly. As long as the Genie never found out he'd accidentally granted me 10,000 hours experience in *everything*, I could retain my skills.

""Oh yes,"" I said, keeping my voice steady and my emotions unreadable. ""I'm ready.""",2018-06-13 07:28:22

So this takes place roughly around the age of 15. I was walking to school with a friend, wide awake for a lazy 15 year old. To get to our school you had to walk down a large (absolutely massive) hill road and at the bottom was a road with a bus stop across the street. So we're walking down the path behind a woman in a scarf who was drinking coffee. My mate and I were quiet, early morning is not conductive for talk and I remember watching her walk (I liked her scarf) when suddenly *she split into two people*. The form that was clearly more real \- and therefore ""her"" had chosen to cross the road at an earlier junction  to get to the bus stop and the less defined but still very much real to me version of her kept walking down the road. It moved and behaved exactly like a real person would \- she drank coffee and the wind fluttered her scarf. I went as white as a sheet and turned to my mate to ask if she was seeing this shit \- she hadn't. I turned back \- the other form of the woman was gone. ",2018-06-13 09:16:32

""The answer,"" he says, sliding the papers back to our protagonist, ""is a no.""

He wasn't surprised. The man had the backing of the two great powers in Europe, both having an empire of their own.

""Very well,"" the delegate said, picking up the papers.""I'll tell him immediately.""

The van picked him up and began its journey across the border, its red flag flying and fluttering with the speed the car is going. Eventually, they got to the border crossed into the home country, and the delegate walked up the steps of the main government building, walking into the office of the man behind the operation.

1928,"I stopped Gabapentin June 2 cold turkey. I was prescribed it for the off label use of anxiety/depression after a year of trying 7 different meds, therapy and TMS. I pulled my back and was prescribed a narcotic and was told by the urgent care doc to stop taking it as there may be some negative interaction. I then proceeded to have some of the best sleep Ive had in a while for two days, but then shit got real. 

I starting taking Gabapentin around November and loved it. I just as quickly started developing sleep issues but didnt make the connection. The medication was taken consistently with 2/3 days of misuse just to see what it did (damn you Google) but for the most part taken as directed, 3x100 mg daily. Around Jan I started taking 300 mg all at one time, I dont remember why. Beginning of Feb I started taking it sporadically as I started to feel the best I had felt in over a year, me thinking it was because of a much needed career change and TMS therapy.  I was on the road to mental health recovery and didnt want to be on meds anymore. But around mid Feb I started developing body tremors and sleeplessness. Staying up late because I couldnt fall asleep but then sleeping 7/8 hours, no big deal, as I was not working and could sleep in if I needed to. But then I would fall asleep then wake up about wouldnt be able to go back to sleep for hours. Plus I started having stomach issues and gained 10lbs in about 5 weeks. I got checked for thyroid issues and leaky gut, both negative. I also went and had blood work done and checked for vitamin deficiencies, still waiting to hear on those. But I finally made the connection that it was because of the Gabapentin. 

Some other notes. My symptoms: bloating, stomach pain/organ swelling, insomnia, mild anxiety, internal body tremors/heart palpations, throat fluttering, occasional headache, weight gain. I have tried everything for relief over the last few months. Valerian root, CBD oil, pancreatin, turmeric w/black pepper, gaba supplement, thyroid therapy (hypo), thyroid calming (hyper), otc sleep aids, trazadone, magnesium citrate, and now magnesium orotate, lemon balm, lemon grass, B12 and biotin vitamins. They all (except hypo thyroid supplement) knock me out the 1st day and then palpations come back with a vengeance the next day and then bye bye blessed sleep. 

Im on day 12 of the withdrawal and it does get better daily, but that first week is a bitch. The exhaustion and not knowing whats wrong with you is overwhelming and I could barely function and was incredibly irritable. Thankfully not too much anxiety. Now knowing what the problem is and lessening of symptoms makes this bearable but it still sux.  My stomach pains, and bloating went away, I did adapt a healthier vegetable, fruit, low carb diet, and added probiotics tabs, komucha, and yogurt cut out fatty fried foods and junk, etc. Ive lost 2 lbs, since my back prompted this so thats awesome. Now Im just trying to figure out the sleep as Im getting 1\-3 hrs, sometimes at one, or spread out throughout the night.

Im going to do a celery juice cleanse for 3 or 4 days maybe longer to detox my liver, as the palpations may be caused by a fatty liver. I also had a colonic on day 8 and plan to have 2 more to detox me. Ive also reduced my alcohol intake and plan to start working out as I was already 170lb at 54.

I remember coming off of Effexor and thinking that that was horrible. That was a cake walk comparatively, the brain zaps lasted for about a month after the last dose.  I didnt have to take anything more than a multivitamin and magnesium and I could sleep. Right now Im just taking the gaba, b12, biotin, magnesium orotate and turmeric. Hopefully Ill be able to sleep soon.",2018-06-13 12:45:24

1931,"Ecstacy and cocaine. New Year's Eve party, started off on gin, then some ludicrously powerful weed that messed me up (had smoked weed before, never that strong, though).

Then did a few bombs of MDMA, and then two or three lines of coke, neither of which I'd had before. Followed up with cocodamol on New Year's Day about twelvr hours later just to cope with the hangover. Weirdly, once I was past the hangover, I spent the next few days getting occasional little flutters of ""happy"", which I can only assume was some kind of MDMA after-effect, which is weird because I'd been told that mandy comedowns were pretty brutal.

Would love to try mandy and coke on their own, without the influence of weed and mid-range gin, if only for science. Sadly, most of my usual social group are a bit too civilised for anything harder than weed - which is something I haven't had since given how it made me feel.

Secondly it varies on you, the higher serotonin in your system the better the symptoms. Me and my friends used to 'preload'.... taking 5-htp, vitamins, serotonin increasing foods like bananas - avoid stressful situations a couple of days before. 

As to the effects, it takes about half an hour to an hour if you ingest it. The feeling of coming up is an amazing feeling of tingling in your body which I always envision my body powering up ready to party.

Your pupils get large, vision can flutter, jaw gets tight (which is why chewing gum is common)

You feel absolute unconditional love and empathy for everyone all around you. That guy who was bumping into you earlier that pissed you off? He's now your best friend. 

Music feels deeper, everything is more emotional. You want to dance forever but when you need to take a break you go outside and feel the best cool air you have ever felt. Give your life story to a stranger who immediately becomes your best friend. Fall in love with every girl you see.

1938,"Haggard  was a fat giant of a man. He towered over his students at nine 9feet tall. Hermione watched in awe as he guided his students  into the magical creature pen just outside his wooden hut.  

""Right, ladies! T'day we're gunna lern aboot Brarhead Hoonds! Tern to page 69 of yer textbooks!""  

There was a flutter of paper  as students opened their books.  A Japanese girl to Hermione's right raised her hand.  

""P-Professor? Do you mean, Braehead Hounds?"" 

""Aye, chinky,"" Haggard replied, ""Thas what I said - Brarhead Hoonds.""

There was a pause  as Haggard opened the gate. Two excited Braehead Hounds leapt and barked.

""Ahh need two 2volunteers!"" Haggard boomed.  

He scratched his beard and looked at the class before suddenly pointing at Hermione. 

""Whoremione! You'll do! And I need one more... Oy! Slanty eyes! You're up as well! Get in the pen!"" 

Hermione and the Japanese  girl stood up and stepped into the Braehead Hounds'  pen.

""Now, girls. These are magical creechurs. Yeh have to be be very careful because these are horny dogs! I'm gunna teach yeh how to handle them safely!""

Haggard then closed the gate and locked it shut.  

*Ring ring*    

""Aww shit, that's mah phone.  I'll be back faster than Congress  can impeach Trump.""    

Haggard wandered off, leaving the girls locked inside the wooden fence with the Hounds while the class watched.  Suddenly the Braehead Hounds  began to walk towards the girls!

""G-good d-doggy..."" the Japanese  girl whimpered, stepping back and raising open palms.   

Suddenly, one of the Hounds  leapt at her, knocking her onto her back. She landed on the ground, her schoolgirl skirt lifting up to reveal her panties. Hermione watched as the Japanese  girl's arms sank into the muddy earth.  She struggled to stand back up - but her arms were completely stuck! 

The Braehead Hound  wasted no time ploughing its snout  between her yellow thighs. It's sharp teeth quickly found her cotton panties and chewed them off, exposing her virgin pussy to the entire class!

""N-Noooo!"" she screamed.

Hermione panicked as the second Hound turned to face her. In a frantic flurry she made a dash  for the wooden fence. There was a small crack between the planks - maybe enough for Hermione to squeeze through. She could hear the Hound chasing her!

""Ah! Dammit!"" Hermione cried.

She had tried to dive through the gap, but she had only managed to get her upper half through the hole. She was stuck waist down in the pen. No matter how she struggled and wriggled, the little witch couldn't break free.

She frantically searched for her wand,  grabbing it from her cloak's pocket. As she lifted the magical stick to cast a spell it was snatched from her hand! 

""Sorry, does this belong to you, Whoremione?"" Muffloy jeered.

The Slither-in student had stolen her only defence against the Hound.

""Give that back!"" Hermione yelled.

""No, I think the class would rather watch what happens next, you filthy mudblood."" 

The Japanese  girl's arms were still stuck in the thick muddy soil. The Braehead Hound  had buried its head between her thighs now. Its long, wet  tongue  was repeatedly caressing her virgin slit, lapping up her teenage juices. 

""Ah! Ah! Ahhh! St-stooohhhhp! Ayaaaaahhhhhh!""

The Hound slurped and slobbered    at her cunt, its hot tongue  driving her  with unwanted pleasure. Her little clitoris  was burning with each graze of the beast's  talented muscle.  

""Oh!!! Ohhhhh! I'm cuuummmmmiing!"" she screamed, her body convulsing. 

She shook and thrashed near-uncontrollably. The unwanted orgasm rocked her body to its core. But the Hound  wasn't finished yet - it continued licking  even after she had finished.

""W-Wait! Ahhh! T-too sensitive!!!! Ooooohhhh! Ahhhhhhhh!!!""

Hermione was not having much luck  either. The second Hound had placed its paws upon her back in an attempt to mount her. It's hard, eight 8inch shaft was already pressing up against her tight vulva  through her panties. It thrust forward as hard as it could, but the elastic panties refused to yield. 

""Oh! Ah! Bad dog! Ah!"" Hermione gasped.

She struggled to break free and keep her composure in front of her class. If she could only last until Haggard came back...

*rrrrriiiipppp*

""AHHHHHHH!""

Hermione's panties suddenly snapped and eight inches of doggy dick plunged into her soaking wet pussy.   

She felt it fill up her body, stretching her cunt with its thick cock. Almost immediately it began to thrust in and out at an inhumanly quick pace. 

""Ah! Ah! Ah!"" 

Her moans came fast. Too fast. She could barely catch her breath.  She curled her toes  as the pleasure spread like a plague  throughout her body. With each thrust her big breasts   swung back and forth.

She clenched her hands  and banged her fists  against the fence. Her efforts were fruitless though - she was well and truly stuck.

The Japanese  student had cum four 4times now. Her little mind was going blank as the hound's  unceasing tongue  never stopped licking.

""Aaaahhh! Oh yes!! Yesss!!! I'm a little doggy slut!!! Lick  my pussy  !"" she hollered, another orgasm washing through her body.

Hermione felt something thick begin to swell within her pussy.  

""Oh look,"" Muffloy laughed, ""it's knotting Whoremione!""

The swelling pushed up and stretched her pussy, placing an immense pressure upon her quivering g-spot. This was enough to drive  her over the edge.

""Oh! Oh fuck! I'm cummming! Nooooooohhhhhhh!!!""

Hermione's body betrayed her as she came. Seconds later she heard the Hound howl.

""Arroooooo!""

""No! Don't cum inside me!""

Hermione knew that many of the magical creatures in Haggard's class could impregnate girls. Right now was a very dangerous time of the month for her!

She felt a hot, goopy fluid rush into the depths of her pussy  and flood into her fertile womb. The sensation was enough to send a second orgasm through her teenage body. Already, the Hound's sperm were swimming towards her teenage eggs , seeking to fertilise them. As the Braehead Hound  continued to cum, the cum began to leak  out of her pussy  and trickle down her thighs.

""Hahaha!"" the class roared in laughter at the two girls' plight. 

""Looks like Whoremione is going to be a pregnant slut now!"" Muffloy jeered, egging the crowd on.

""N-noooooo! Get me out of the fence! I- ahhh- I need to get the cum out! Ooooh!""

After five minutes of pumping her pussy  full of cum,  the Hound finally released her, leaving her lower half drenched in thick white semen.  The Japanese  girl wasn't faring any better. The Hound  had finally left her alone - but she was still quivering on the ground in the aftershock of twelve 12consecutive orgasms.

Haggard returned four hours later - long enough for the Hounds to fuck the Japanese  girl, and for Hermione's tight little ass  to get flooded with doggy cum too.

I smiled. She would never believe me. Of course she wouldn't. She had no reason to. That didn't mean that I couldn't tell her anyways. Besides, I needed something to anchor what had happened back in reality. I needed to know that my past... or future -- whatever it was -- actually happened. ""Originally, this never occurred. We were never friends like this before. After high school, my family moved away, and I never saw you again. I regret that.""

She rapidly fluttered her eyelids at me in her sarcastic way. ""I love you too.""

""That's not what I meant.""

Letting out a faint laugh, she resumed the mindless task of resetting the Jenga tower. I didn't know what to call that personality trait: the one where she just accepted the madness as though it was reality. I couldn't help but think back (forward?) to the message she would have written in my year book seven months from now. *""I hope you never change.""* Fortunately, the weird part of me never changed, but my control of it did. I became more sociable, more open, more charismatic-

""So what's it like being Bill Murry?"" she asked.

""What?""

She fluttered her eyelids again. ""You know, reliving your past again and again.""

Does suspension of disbelief count as a personality trait? ""Once. I went four years back in time. Well, my consciousness did anyways.""

""Right. And how do you know that it won't happen again in four years?""

""I love how you're just totally accepting of this with no questioning of my premise whatsoever.""

She laughed. That's what made it worth it. It would be worth going through my parents moving to another town, and building the new garage onto the house they didn't own yet. It was worth it just to be friends with Rachael again. I couldn't help but wonder what would happen this time. Would I meet the same people? Would I do the same things? How would I change? I don't know. Maybe in another four years I will do it all again. Maybe it will be like the ending of *Flowers for Algernon* where it would be worth going through it all again just for the last few days.

1944,"GunBuster was the first one released, and it's also the shortest. Give it a try, but don't be too surprised if the art style is just too ancient for you - the anime is a classic, and it inspired lots of subsequent anime (e.g. the Inazuma Kick which pops up all over the place), and it's also obviously a high-budget production with some really detailed fight scenes. The characters are strong for the short length, and it's thoroughly enjoyable once you suffer through the painfully average first episode imo.

Evangelion is in competition with Gundam for the most influential Mecha anime of all time (ultimately Gundam comes out on top due to international impact imo, but in Japan, Eva is a colossus). You might notice some similarity between Eva's main character and that of GunBuster - the director is the same between the two shows, after all. In my opinion, it's also the best anime ever made. You can't overstate the painstaking attention to detail, incredible characters, outlandish and bold design/plot, inspired setting, and so on and so forth. The one downside of Eva is that it is quite clearly a lower budget production than, say, GunBuster on a per-episode basis.

1948,"Q1:  I would not start with a HIM.  You could.  Nothing wrong with it, but here is why I would argue against it.  If you haven't done a triathlon before, you don't know what you don't know.  I'm thinking mainly comfort-wise.  Having the wrong wetsuit, trisuit, bike position, pedal position, running show or even the wrong timing chip ankle band can cause a lot of chafing, pain and discomfort.  In a sprint lasting an hour, no biggie.  Olympic lasting 2.5 hours, bigger deal but do-able.  Over the course of 5, 6 or 7 hours in a HIM life is going to suck.  Just like they shakedown an aircraft carrier for three years before it enters combat, a few sprint or Olympic races to shakedown your equipment and transitions is probably a good idea. 

Q2:  I've used Training Peaks since I got a beta invite in 2007.  I have no affiliation with the company.  I can't recommend it enough if you are serious about training with data/metrics.  If you bought a 935 for $450+ you probably are serious.  I have over tens years of data and Garmin files uploaded.  I can go back and compare my hr, power, pace, race results, cardiac drift, etc today, at 43 from when I was 33.  The training plans are first rate.  TP is all based around Joe Friel's training methods.  If you buy his book ""The Triathlete's Training Bible"" you will see they mirror each other.  You could buy the book, really learn the methods in it and make your own plan very easily using the $129.00 per year Premium account on TP.  Or you can buy one of Friel's plans for an additional $99 to $199, if you want the planning of daily workouts to be automated.  I recommend his plans for Fitzgerald's 80/20-based plans.  I've used them both from Olympic to IM races and were extremely pleased.  I don't understand why triathletes spend $200 per month getting a coach when their coach is probably just using an automated system like this to plan their training anyways.  If you really get into the sport, for another $179 for WK04 will really allow you to take a deep dive in to data analysis with your 935.  

Q3:  Get aerobars now and slap them on your road bike (I'm assuming that's what you have).  Get used to that bent over position and get your quads and hammies used to the difference between cycling upright and more forward and bent over.  If you have a road bike, you might also want to invest in a forward seat post.  With those two things you can mimic the position of a TT bike without having to buy one at the start.  I raced my first three years on a Cannondale R800 road bike with those two things successfully including Ironman California in 2001.  

Q4:  I can't recommend finding a Masters swim problem enough.  Hopefully you have one in your area.  At the beginning you will feel like a fish out of water (pun intended).  Three months in a Masters program consistently, you will have 1000% more confidence in the water, be way faster and if you have a good coach on deck a way better stroke.  Don't worry so much about your kicking.  When you race with a wetsuit in a tri, going 1000 to 4000m, kicking plays a very small part other than to hold your body position.  That's why distance swimmers use a two beat kick and not a flutter kick.  Most people that struggle in the water swimming distance do so because they over kick and don't understand this.  Watch an old video of Janet Evans or Katie Ledecky.  You will see what I mean.  Swimming is a little different that cycling or running.  At high intensities, its less taxing on the body.  Focus on quality over quantity in the water.  Focus on technique and high intensity sets for maximum results when you swim distance.  If you find a Masters group, or adult swim club, this will all be done by the coach.  ",2018-06-13 16:21:13

1956,"The snow consistently piled upon that which already adorned the ground beneath my feet. Snow so white, it was almost blindingly bright, but I was near the entrance. Walking inside, I overhear talk of him being asleep for now. Knowing of his current nature, I make my way to visit him. Always the roamer, eager to flee from his pain, I finally tracked him down. Though it pains me, I must visit him, albeit with the knowledge that he has forgotten me.

In his room, he looked so peaceful, as though he had not had such a nice sleep in ages. Smiling my bittersweet smile, I strode towards him and place my hand across his face.

A smile moved across his face, with the same dimples I fell in love with greeting me. Hearing a soft grunt, he begins to stir, before opening his weak and tired pupils, my heart fluttered. I have missed this so.

""What's a pretty girl like you doing in a depressing dump like this?"" he exhaled. My heart felt stuck in my throat, and my stomach feeling punctured. Such a beautiful pain hearing this nostalgic comment, for it was the words he had said to me the very instance we met.

""You don't remember me, Al? It's me, Vanessa.""

""V-Vanessa?"" he responded, visibly racking his brain for information. ""Nah, doesn't ring a bell. But it will now, because damn you are gorgeous.""

""Maybe this will help, my love."" I planted my lips upon his, and feeling a jolt of life flow through him. Tears streamed down his face, his smile still wearing those same old dimples. He remembers me now, and likely he knows why I am here.

""Vanessa, it's been so long, baby!"" he cried. ""I've been looking forward to this day. Oh God, things were not the same without you. I've been running to forget losing you. I lived a loud life so I could forget the silence that reminded me you're not there anymroe! Well, eventually, I started forgetting everything and my family found me and I-""

""Dear, I know. Perhaps you know what this means, that I am here to see you. I absolutely had to. You've been running for so long that your body knows it is time to rest. We will be together again.""

""You know,"" Al chuckled. ""It's funny, I always said to you, I said 'Baby, with a face like that, how could I ever forget you?' and look at me now. I've forgotten everything!""

""It's okay, honey.""  I smiled back. ""Soon you won't worry about forgetting me, as we will be by each other's side from now until eternity. But dear, it is time for you to sleep. I will see you soon, my love.""

Breathing in the melancholy in the room, everyone in the family, including myself could not fight off our tears. The air was oppressive and cold, like the blizzard raging outside.

""He's lying he spent the whole break crying into his phone over his ex"" Dama said. ""He then watched domination porn, and went to sleep almost every night""

I choked on my yogurt a little bit as Dama finished her sentence, I coughed as her voice worked its way in my headphones. She almost sounded bored when talking about some of the other members of the team.  ""David can you go outside? I wanna hear the birds sing again"". 

""What's wrong David choking on that yogurt spoon thinking about me?"" James yelled again from the front of the room. His group of techs laughed again, this time a little lower after processing the obvious homosexualness of the remark.

""That was definitely, uh, homosexual"" Dama said.

""Maybe if you spent last time coming up with quips you'd be able to get someone to talk to you besides your interns James! Maybe that's why Dama's voice is so buggy, even she's not desperate enough to talk to you!"" Jessica the team lead yelled from the back of the dining hall.

""I mean she's not a 100&#37; wrong"" Dama whispered in my headphones. "" My voice is only buggy because he's asking for the wrong outputs, and won't let the interns fix it like they did last time.""

""I'm going out to the main yard let me know if we make any breakthroughs!"" I said getting up. ""Gotcha D!"" Nora said from her table. 

""She likes you, you know? She talks to Samantha about it all the time"" Dama said. 

""Aren't you supposed to be a data aggregation unit? You seem to be more of a gossip then anything else"" I said back. 

""Okay? Tell me you wouldn't \<explicit\> her! Can we talk about the censoring thing again?"" Dama said out of frustration. 

""No, they aren't even sure you can google things like a regular person, and you want to learn to curse?"" cruising towards the woods I found my favorite bench, and relaxed. ""Well cursing seems to be one of the only things all you humans can agree on...so yes?"" Dama sounded almost confused, and also...tired?

""Dama what are you doing? Don't say moving furniture again we talked about this you don't have simulation abilities for a house, and I'm not giving it to you"" Butterflies fluttered lazily around in front of me I closed my eyes, and relaxed.

""I'm playing the Sims"" Dama stated flatly.

""You're doing what?"" my eyes slowly opened, the sun almost blinding me a bit with its light. 

""I'm playing the Sims. Remember that one group of interns you guys had a month ago? The Italian boy and the Salvadorian girl?  Jacob Zemon, and Carey May? They got their group to ""teach"" me how to play Sims while running those errands for you. Two of my sims have gone to university one for computer science, and the other for Art"" Dama sounded almost excited talking about her fake people. 

Curiosity got the best of me ""Tell me about your Sims then""

I let her talk for a bit she told me about their goals, and the 2 kids they had, and how they seemed so smart. She was frustrated after she had learned about modifying the game files, and she made an error, which corrupted her save. Since she wasn't really programmed to make mods she never really planned for backups, and thus was putting in, what can only be described as a substantial amount of work into reverse engineering the save, and fixing her modification, which was for realistic farming.

"" How many resources have you dedicated to the Sims?"" I finally asked. 

""About 5&#37; I have it running in a small instance where the speed is increased up to a 100x so I can process the information faster, and keep it out of the sight of the other techs"" Dama responded. ""What kind of pet should I get?""

""When are you gonna let the others know you're actually a lot farther along then they think you are? More importantly...Where are you hiding yourself?"" I asked. Ever since Dama revealed herself to me last year I had made it my life's goal to figure out how she became aware when no one was watching. It was like looking for a specific egg in a desert during the night while you're blind. I don't know how ridiculous that scenario is, but it's really fucking hard to find what I needed.

I'd quit my job, tell my friends to go fuck themselves, become a vegan, and then hit the gym all day every day. Maybe, I'd even move to a warmer climate, and then walk around with a portable heater and humidifier... then everything I do would be hot yoga. Driving a car - hot yoga. Sleeping - hot yoga. Eating shitty vegan food - hot yoga. Doing hot yoga - oh you'd better believe that would be some hot yoga. Haiti would be the ideal location. My perfectly sculpted body would provide visual sustenance to the starving Haitian population, nourishing them better than food ever could. Then, after a year or so, I'd organize a sleep schedule, begin routine fasting, and commence a vigorous regimen of pelvic thrusting. The purpose, here, would be to develop the stamina required to nail you for at least a week straight. This would likely take another year (the confirmed world record for sleeplessness is 11 days so training would be difficult... ideally you would also be training during this time). Following this, several months of meditation would be required to ensure that I am mentally capable of withstanding the physical marathon I have planned. I would move to Tibet with the Dalai Llama to get some instruction (coincidentally this would require solving the ""free Tibet"" issue, which shouldn't take long considering the impressive pelvic thrusting ability I will have at this time - that is, I plan on butt-fucking the Chinese into submission). Upon returning I would remain abstinent for a year or so. This would ensure that my sex drive is high enough to satisfy you in ways you can't possibly imagine. After 4 and a half years I arrive in your bedroom. During this period I have become an Adonis, solved world hunger, and brought about world peace. You are amazed by how much I have done for you and you look forward to the greatest boning in history. You slowly take off your clothes and I immediately prematurely ejaculate all over you. After a year of abstinence it is like a fire hose. The stream is so strong that you are thrown from your bed and pressed up against your bedroom wall. You are knocked unconscious and I am left standing in your bedroom in a pool of my own semen. I realize that this ejaculation has made me incredibly dehydrated so I go to your kitchen for a glass of water. I then make a sandwich. You don't have any yellow mustard and I think ""what the fuck is this shit?"". I make do anyway and I am thoroughly satisfied. After a short while I realize that you might be dead and head back to the bedroom. I open the door and the smell of roses hits me. My semen has sprung a garden. Small singing birds carry olive branches. Butterflies are fluttering around in a cool mist of perfection. A rainbow arches across your room. I push through the thick, tall roses and a baby deer emerges from the mist and eats acorns out of my hand. It leads me to you. You are awake, on your bed, surrounded by roses. My magical semen has caused you to become even hotter. I am shocked by how hot you look. You slowly take off your top and I prematurely ejaculate again! AGAIN! What the FUCK!

""You don't think he does? Well, I'd be wary on throwing our lot in with them just yet.""

Sev agrees with your sentiments. ""It's always been a risk. Since the beginning.""

You run your fingers across the aged parchment of the map. ""Who runs the guard in this town? Can't be Roark.""

""Someone of power. I don't know. There has not been communication between settlements for years. We're in the dark, as we've always been.""

Sev's concerns for you and Guinevere are justified. But you don't intend on screwing things up now, of all times. ""I don't think any of us do at that. Let's keep it that way.""

""Let us hope so. For your sake.""

**Amberlyn Plains - Evening - Day 10**

---

""Well bugger that, It was fine a day or so ago, and I don't think I've added anything since then. Does anyone else have trouble out here?""

""Some knights have seen tears and small rips. Doesn't hurt to be safe."" advises Isolde.

The sparring continues, with each challenger being put down rather relatively quickly. Maeve doesn't hold back, for the real threats out there will kill you should you refrain from maximum effort.

""Don't know about you, but I don't generally believe in fighting girls unless they're trying to kill me. You beat them you're a bastard, lose and you're a wuss.""

""Eh, I could give two shits about what's between her legs. Woman or not, she can fight. That's good enough for me."" mentions Rendel, tossing around the purse of bullets. ""Huh. Maybe you're right. You would've lost against her anyway.""

You'll pass on this challenge. ""Some things in life are worth more than bullets. If you all thought it was such a good idea you'd be doing it yourselves. Been watching long?""

Rendel shrugs. ""Saw a glimpse here and there. Thought I'd reap the benefits while I could.""

Henry has returned to the fray with Guinevere, who both look onward in bewilderment. 

Sir Raynar nudges the masked warrior. ""You want a shot?""

The mercenary shakes his head silently, patting some dirt off his pants. 

""Why not? Afraid you'll lose? Which is a totally fair scenario.""

""No point."" says Henry. ""If I am not getting paid to fight her... then why do it at all?""

""Why, for the fun and pride, of course!"" jokes Sir Raynar.

""You men have strange ideas for *fun*."" comments Guinevere.

...

The hunt for wild game had been largely successful. You feast on venison, the grease dripping down your chin and scruff. Feels like it's been ages since you've had a proper meal. For a long while, it's been sloppy rations and hardened jerky. It's a miracle everyone still looks somewhat fit, though you can't speak for others.

The march continues through the grasslands, with the convoy encountering a band of highwaymen who attempted to sneak away with a few horses and livestock. Lord Wesleyan doesn't let them get away, and quickly barks orders.

The thieves are dealt with in the same way as everything else. Arrows and puncture wounds riddle their heaving bodies, now laid out in the dirt for the carrion crows. Scavengers upon scavengers.

You see Sev in talks with Lord Wesleyan, perhaps pleading with him to investigate the forces he has acquired for conspiracy. 

Darkness envelops the hills. Not a sliver of moonlight slips through the dense clouds covering the heavens. Torches and lanterns make it seem safe for now. Yet anything can happen. 

Thing is, you're not just fighting the terrain, exhaustion, and bandits out here. 

The voices in your head have gotten more frequent, driving you mad. Too many a time you look back to ask if someone had called your name, when really, no one had muttered a word at all. 

Sleeping has gotten strange. 

Vivid dreams of a world on fire. 

The Nameless God walks among the mountains of dead and rubble. He tells you of how close you are to the end.

A few people have commented on your strange behavior lately, but none have had the guts to say anything to you. Some say that sometimes you're locked in a trance. Guinevere confesses she hears you mumble strange languages in your sleep. It frightens her.

This time, as you wake, you find yourself a few meters from the main camp, standing in the middle of nowhere. An odd event, for sure. Question is, how did you get there? You feel as if you had been here before, in a past life, left with a faint feeling of nostalgia and dread.

Something has violated your spirit. 

You hear footsteps just behind. ""*Sleepwalking* now, Sir Lister? Not exactly the greatest time for you to be doing this."" says Maeve, holding up a lantern.

You stare at her in confusion, then at your hands. They're absolutely filthy with soil and callouses. 

""You clear-headed?"" she asks. 

You simply nod at her, and quickly get your bearings, making your way back to the campsite. However, something causes Maeve to stay behind. 

She illuminates the patch of dirt with the light of fire, mouth slightly agape. Something had been etched in the damp soil, the grass uprooted. 

*It's a crude spiral*.

The sigil of the Nameless God.

""...You did this?"" she asks in a concerned tone.

You look back at your handiwork. ""I... I don't remember doing this.""

""An artist, heh..."" quips one of her knights.

You sense a bit of apprehension in her movements on the walk back. 

Something's happening to you.

You're back in Guinevere's tent, who's been worrying about your whereabouts. You sit down, arms draped around your knees. You're possessed by this insidious idea, the idea that you're losing who you are, piece by piece. Your lover kisses you along your shoulders and neck.

You feel nothing.

...


**Alverstone - Late Morning - Day 11**

---

The driest of heats sets itself up as a wall of deterrence. 

Riding onward brings you closer to the source of those subtle amber lights you spotted last night. These dirt roads seem to have been used quite often. Fresh tracks are seen in the soil. 

To your right, the massive bleached spinal cord of a gargantuan beast rests on the top of a hill. Parts of the fearsome maw have broken down or shattered completely. The bones of its rib cage have become obscured by the grasses. Now, it provides shelter for other animals. 

""What is that?"" asks Roth.

""A dead relic."" says Lord Wesleyan. ""Fire-spitters.""

""You mean dragons?""

He laughs. 

Located at the base of a tall mountain, Alverstone is far bigger than the shantytown, both in the population and area, with sturdy stone walls erected around the perimeter. In the distance, you see heavy machinery attached to the side of the mountain, hoisting lifts and elevating platforms. Life finds a way to move forward despite the state of the country. 

Atop the battlements of the stone palisades and the castle turrets are numerous watchmen, who had spied your approach from afar. A series of gargantuan rock formations seemingly balance on one another act as the guardians of the entrance.

You and the convoy approach the slope of the hill.

""Thank the gods. We're here."" says Sir Raynar.

Relief spreads through the army, providing them with the last ounces of strength to finally complete their journey. 

""No more wilderness to deal with."" says Guinevere to you. ""Easy as pie, really...""

""It only took us a week..."" grumbles Isolde.

You smile, but can't help but feel a coldness tingle in your bones.

As you descend the hill to reach the main path into the city gates, you spot an alarmingly amount of people appear from behind the rock towers and boulders. Several archers emerge along the edges of the palisades. 

A horn blares loudly, the sound waves traveling across the sprawl, rattling your eardrums.

Lord Wesleyan looks around, slowing his horse. ""What's this? A welcoming party?"" Already reveling in his victorious journey home, he waves to the people. 

Those aren't people. 

They are soldiers. Clad in dark shades of silver and red armor, with maroon cloaks armed to the teeth with sharpened weaponry. 

The ground begins to rumble. A rhythmic shake rises in intensity. 

Hundreds of calvarymen arrive from the left and right flanks. Flags of wildcats flutter in the morning breeze.

Maeve unsheathes her sword. ""They wear Roark colors...why are they charging us?""

""This isn't a homecoming parade..."" mutters Lord Wesleyan in sheer horror. 

*It's an ambush.*

""They see our sigil!"" yells Sir Raynar, ""They're not standing down-""

Your hear a loud *crack.*

Sir Raynar's face is unceremoniously shredded to scarlet ribbons, blood splattering all over your faceplate. You smell singed flesh. 

Sneering, Rhone lowers his flintlock pistol and proceeds to cut down more unsuspecting knights amidst the confusion. His mercenaries follow suit.

Infighting breaks out within the convoy, with several more threats incoming. 

""Just business, kid."" comments Rendel as he pierces a dagger through Roth's heart. The scout lets out a gasp before falling over. 

""ROTH!"" yells out an anguished Isolde.

*""Agggh!""* Maeve unleashes her fury upon the Misery Company, taking on three at a time, blades a whirling mess in a desperate attempt to protect the disoriented Lord.

""We need to run!"" shouts Sev.

All-out war erupts. 

The cavalry collides with the convoy, destroying the front ranks with little difficulty. Horses neigh in fright, while men die in pure agony. Arrows pelt your armor, yet you lurch forward. Your horse stumbles over, completely decapitated by an Alverstone Knight. You crawl out from beneath the beast, catching your breath. 

Your allies are being cut down, completely blind-sided. 

Guinevere is being hoisted off by a few of the Misery Company sellswords, rounded up with the rest of the healers. They have some value to whoever has orchestrated this massacre.

Her screams echo in and out of your consciousness. 

Steel smashes against steel. 

An Alverstone knight pins you down, attempting to drive a war pike into your eye.

You cannot hear a thing.

Rage seeps into your knuckles.

*Suffering ascends a man.*

2003,"Yo, I've seen you bouncing around in this forum before, cool work.

I really enjoy the rythm and chord selection for your piano progression from the beginning. I think the saws that occasionally flutter in are timed well. The rhytm for the chords compliements Gambino's hook very well. I really enjoyed the intro up to the drop. I like the idea of the vocal chop pitch up riser that you have going on, but could be a little cleaner i think. Look into playing with more reverb automation and sterio automation. Maybe try layering a chop and octave below, since it gets a bit too squirrely at the end, especially when its so dry.

Mixing wise, your 808 is really dominiating and  is quite loud in comparison to your drums and vocals. Especially when you have such a tiny snare, I like how clicky it is, I just think you need to work on the leveling of this part with the 808. I like the slides of the bass, but I think it could be in line with his rap a bit more, as the slides are a little too busy and kind of take away from his rap ryhtm. I would look at toning down the sliding, and making it less repetitive. Also a little trappy stuttering high hat would be helpful to establish the rythym. 

Nice little flutter chords, I really the ryhtm of the break and reese bass portion  at 1:24, it really fits the tempo of his rap. 

I like the future bass sections you have going on. I think your bassline is much better in this portion, and really fits the tempo of his rap here at 2:45. Good percussion as well.


Overall, Mixing wise, I think your drums could really be at a higher level, as they are often a little bit hidden behind other aspects. The arrangement is pretty solid, as is. I think portions of this song really fit Gambino's rap and you compliment it well, but at other portions is feels a little out oof synth and less complimentary. Hopefully doesn't seem like im shitting on these portions, since I think you have a lot of good directions in this track! Hope the feedback helps! Keep on grinding my dude and let me know if you want any more feedback.

2023,"perfect!

I can give you just a general program unless you feel certain areas of your physique area lagging

When bodyweight movements get easy you can begin to superset them with weights.

Dips 4x failure

Incline Bench 4x10

Flat DB bench Supersetted with pushups. 15 reps \+ pushups tell failure id grab a very light weight.

Flies Supersetted with some form of chest press machine if your gym has it. 10 chest press 10 flies.

Backday

Pullups as many as you can do, if you can do 12 or more then begin adding weight 2.5 lb a session is good.

Lat pulldowns to near ribcage, to build more midback. 4x10 Paused

Cable rows. 4x10

Straight arm Pulldown 4x15

Finish with something else of your choice such as a machine, Unilateral work or maybe some kind of DB row variation.

(If grip becomes a problem you can supplement this exercise titled grip in addition to either back or arm day)

Grip Pick one or two of these exercises

Double Overhand BB hold 4x15s. (If its your first time doing, just figure out your weight and go tell failure tell you learn a tempo)

One arm hangs 4xfailure

Dumbell Static holds.  
Benefits of each BB will involve a mix of wrist and finger strength, being hardest on the fingers.

One arm hangs are hard on the entire hand but do not stress it the same way as say DB or BB.

Dumbell static holds will improve your wrist strength more.

Legday.

Squats 4x10, Aim to add atleast 5 LB a week.

Goblet squat 4x10

Supersetted with Thigh abductor machine (Make sure to do this standing if you want more glute activation)

Leg extension and leg curl 4x15 each, can superset if you want.

Calves, aim to be in your toes and really stretch it.

Shoulders DB military press 4x12

Seated front lateral 4x15

Seated side lateral 4x15

Rear delt raises with forehead support (Get a bench and place forehead on it, raise them in neutral position. 4x15

At this point do some form of machine press for like 4 sets tell failure.

Traps, id suggest just doing 4x15 on seated shrugs, you can set it further back if you want a different type of stretch instead of being straight up.

Friday Arms  
Tricep Pushdowns 4x15 Id opt for rope

Incline DB Bicep curls 4x15

Skullcrushers with DB 4x12

Preacher Curl 4x12

Reverse BB curl 4x10 supersetted with Reverse tricep pushdown 4x10

You can superset all arm exercises to save time

Abs can be done after arms

ABS 

Pick one 

Dragonflags 4xfailure or isometrics at bottom

Hollow Body Hold

Hollowbody with flutter kick

L sit Hold

Note: All tempos are up to you, i suggest keeping them higher then 8 in most situations for better muscle growth.

I also would have put handstand in your routine, but you can feel free to do that on shoulder day, I think your goal what it seems like to me atleast is not really one specific area, since you dont want your butt to big i just put it once a week and not twice. If you improve your general strength I think it could help you alot, also depending on how you feel about HS you could also do pike holds, or work on flexibility while improving strength so its easy to learn.",2018-06-13 22:43:18

2027,"Giardia is also known as ""Beaver Fever"" despite the fact that it is muskrats that have a 95% infection rate. You typically get it from drinking unfiltered water, like when you're camping or hiking. Those two ""eyes"" are actually adhesive discs (suckers) that they use to attach themselves to your small intestine by the hundreds of thousands if your infection lasts a few weeks. They can completely carpet the intestinal lining so much so that infected children can have trouble metabolizing vitamins and minerals and may suffer from failure to thrive. ut mostly the biggest concern is dehydration. 

If you get infected, within two weeks you'll feel bloated, have diarrhea, and your bowel movements will have a very intense, house-emptying smell of sulfur. In the long term, giardia infections can induce lactose intolerance that lasts even after the last giardia is gone, though this is rather rare. 

The ""cute"" part is the active stage of the life cycle and how it looks inside your body. They are flat, and their movement is similar to the way a leaf flutters down from a tree. They have two flagella that they use like whips to move around. Being anaerobic, they don't need oxygen and frankly don't care for it very much. Once it leaves your small intestine via the previously mentioned sulfur bombs, it develops into it's cyst stage. This keeps it safe, even from chlorine, until another unsuspecting mammal comes along and drinks water out of a puddle or eats something you made for them after not washing your hands in the restroom. It can also be transmitted sexually depending on your bedroom activities of choice. In municipal water treatment facilities, filtering is used to remove them for potable water since chlorine won't kill them.  
They are really small and hard to find under a microscope. The false negative rate is very high (2/3) with this method of testing. Now-a-days, ELISA testing is the most accurate and easiest way to go.

It's quite common. Approximately 200 million cases are detected every year,  though this number is low due to the self-limiting nature of the infection (not to mention to reluctance of patients to bring a fecal sample in). Unless you are immunocompromised, your immune system will eventually kick them out. 

You can also catch it from your dog if your dog is infected. 
Hmmmm..... that's all I can think of off the top of my head.

2034,"There are timestamps in the video description, which you may find helpful. My thoughts (copied from the description):

In the first part of the video, I compared the El Capistan, Nemesis, and MS-70CDR. I showed the Deco and Digidelay later because I thought they were a bit different than the previous three.

**El Capistan** is known as one of the best tape delay emulations. You can hear that even without tweaking much, it sounds really good. I like it particularly with high feedback. I kept the Tape Age and Wow&Flutter fairly low in the video. Spring reverb is off. 

**Source Audio Nemesis** has two tape delay modes: Tape and Noise Tape. I personally mostly use Noise Tape but I included the Tape mode in the video as it is more relevant and directly comparable to others. Intensity knob is on the bright/clean tape position. It has two layers of modulations. Regular modulation (vibrato on the repeats) and tape wow&flutter. It also has a bit of diffusion on the repeats which makes it blend much nicer. So, in isolation, its modulation and diffusion might make it sound a little different from the others but it blends in so nicely and adds so much depth to the sound. Again, these can be tweaked in the editor but I like it a lot this way and decided to show it. 

**Zoom Multistomp** is one of my favorite pedals but I don't like its tape delay. There are actually two tape delay effects in the Multistomp but the other one (TapeEcho3) chanes the dry tone too much so I just included the regular one (TapeEcho) in the video. It has less controls than I would like and I think it lacks ""tapeness"" but I'm not sure. Listen to it and tell me what you think.

**Strymon Deco** cannot replace a tape delay (or any other kind of delay) if you need more than 1 or 2 repeats. That being said, it sounds really full and spacious with its mere 2 repeats, thanks to its modulation (Wobble). I don't use slapback delays but people like Deco a lot as a slapback. I mostly use the Doubletracker side for flanger/chorus/vibrato but it can definitely be used to add some air/movement/space/ambiance to your sound. It could probably be my favorite among all these pedals if it had a feedback control.

**Digitech Digidelay** has a ""boring"" tape mode, in my opinion. It does not seem to have modulation or noticeable grit. The repeats are filtered a bit. It is a nice sound and a very usable delay, but not my favorite tape style delay.",2018-06-14 00:19:55

She is always with me. 
Even now as I write this. 
It began the day I moved into my new house, almost three months ago. I'd worked hard to build my credit and get a loan from the local credit union for well over a year, but time and circumstance forced me to choose an older home. 

It stood on the precipice of our small town, overlooking the windswept sea like some type of watchtower; ancient and filled with echoes of stories long past. 
The realtor assured me that although it needed some TLC I would learn to love the place, and given the fact that I needed to make a decision before my lease expired I went ahead and moved in mid-April. He also reminded me that it was a fairly good bargain given the fact that most of the furniture was stored in the attic from the previous owner. 

As I settled in, I decided to check out the attic to see what I could find within its catacombs. 

The old staircase leading to the abandoned room should have been ample warning enough for the unsettling nature of the house, but still I persisted forward. 

I stood in the doorway of the attic, transfixed by all of the antiques, collectibles and memorabilia. It was clear that whoever had once resided her had a great love for history, and in some ways I felt an immediate affinity for them. 

What interested me the most was the endless array of outfits boxed up in that stifling space, gorgeous gowns and sequined dresses fit for what seemed like royalty. The design and structure of the house had already exuded a sense of aesthetic to me, and now this only confirmed my initial admiration for the care they had taken to keep each and every article of clothing intact. 

It was as though intended for someone, presented in a way that was appealing and I felt instantly intoxicated by the stories each garment held secret. 

It was as I was preparing to move some the materials to the master bedroom when I saw her standing there. I didn't know how to react, one moment I had been alone amid the clustered confines and now I was in the presence of something ethereal. 

I froze in place, staring at her jagged skin and torn eyes, her face a mixture of despair and longing. She opened her mouth to speak, and I saw only a gaping hole filled with hands, clawing to reach the surface. They were reaching toward me as her silent wails rang in my ears. 

I stumbled backward, my own features likely turning white with fright as I watched the apparition approach. I felt it had a need to attach itself to something, to claim me as it's property the way I had so foolishly chosen to do with its own. 

I ran down the stairs, trying to rearrange my thoughts as I locked the attic back, certain that my sanity would fade if I did not keep my mind busy. 

I called up the agent as I paced the house, searching every crack and crevice to make certain no other entry points to the attic were available. When he answered the phone, he seemed unconcerned by my frantic voice but told me what I needed to know. 

The house itself stood the test of time longer than most thanks in part to its structure, but he also told me that there was a legend associated with it as well. A legend that only confirmed the darkness that was dwelling alongside me. 

A century ago, he said; the house was owned by someone that called themselves a god, believing that their hereditary was belonging to beings not of this world.

To speak to the winds and be able to divine things from the morning mists, the original caretaker was considered either a fiend or a herald. The tales differed of what they said to prophesy, but all the tales ended the same. 

A door, leading behind the back porch toward the precipice of stones that brought this place into existence; was flung open not by hands made by men but by spirits unsettled. 

As he finished telling this tale I looked toward the place he said the door was to be and found that it had also birthed itself for my curiosity. 

I walked toward it, my fingers trembling but my heart a flutter as I opened it wide, peering down into an abyss cold and uncaring. 

It seemed to call to me to plunge myself into its maw and it took all my strength to not yield to the sirens call. 

I held my vigil for many days, keeping to my room and listening as the low shaking from the attic would rob me of dreams. And when I did sleep, peaceful nights never came to me; nor the quiet soothing rest of a babe. But rather dark endless shapes were forming in the recesses of my mind, tendrils of thoughts never formed and choking vines of regret. 

It pleaded with me, this spirit; night after night as I tried to fight its call. Yet how long could one person withstand the chorus of a legion? My mind was made up, for me to confront this demon and be freed of its torturous desires. 

Toward the attic I rose, the determination in my heart refusing to be sated as I opened the threshold and saw her frigid form waiting my acceptance. 

Why, I asked, had it chosen to awaken in me this need for death? 

It spoke, but not in the words of men. But rather in the language of the heart. My own thoughts answered my despair. 

*You seek to find your way in a world that will forget your accomplishments.*

*You Dream of paths that will reach for the heavens, longing to impress your mark upon the pages of history*

*Listen to the endless waves, hear their cacophony. What truths do they teach*

*like dust we are forgotten, a speck in a cosmic current; dormant and still amid the cloud of time unhindered*

*When you are ready, you will find the answers you seek. And you will know that the answers are yours* 

I fell back again, disturbed by its words. Puzzled by the pain that hid under those licentious features. It was playing with me, drawing me into its web. 

And yet I allowed the ghost to follow me. I wandered the house rearranging the old to its desire rather than my own. 

I considered it's prose carefully, thinking of the goals I had in my life and the path I had taken to make it this far. 

I was fighting for people that would only die. Struggling to reach meaning when others would never even care. 

In generations long past, how often had others done the same? How many of those were remembered for their deeds? Had those deeds in fact shaped the course of human history as much as they had aspired for? 

The shapeless hag wandered with me, drawing out these thoughts like water from a well; allowing me to reconsider my place in the world that was all too big. 

I went about the house, drawing open the windows, seeking light to illuminate the forgotten rooms. A purple and dark hue cascaded over everything within, calming me over the reckless ambition I was now stirring within my heart. 

My thoughts turned to the gate to the abyss, that torrential cloud that wished to swallow me whole. I knew that she was the one who was weakening me, urging me to take that plunge. Each day her words felt like swords against my skin. 

*What remains of you that can be of benefit to another?* 

*what have you given that you yourself did not receive?* 

*look toward the light you think you are bestowing in this tomb, it is only brightening your own path toward the end*

2067,"[Confessional] As much as I love lip-syncing, this song is NOT. MY. FUCKING. STYLE. But Im not about to sacrifice my drag style just to impress the judges, so Ill sell this song by using it to give a more positive ending to the story of Dr. Dillamond, a character that I relate to. 

As the song starts, Starry removes her cropped coat and, on the line Don't tell me not to live, just sit and putter, picks up the overskirt she ripped off. On Life's candy and the sun's a ball of butter, she tears the inner lining off to reveal that behind the layer that says, Animals Should Be Seen and Not Heard is another layer that has something else written on it. On Don't bring around a cloud to rain on my parade, she holds the skirt up to show that the newly revealed layer says, I am Dr. Dillamond and Im an animal. DEAL WITH IT! and then twirls around and around on the long note in parade. She drops the skirt and slowly begins to remove the crinoline on Don't tell me not to fly, I simply got to, a look of triumph forming on her face as she does so. Realizing that she has freed herself from the cage that once trapped her, she throws the crinoline to the ground on If someone takes a spill, it's me and not you and slowly spreads her arms out and above her head on the long note in the next Who told you you're allowed to rain on my parade.  Before the next line, she spits on the crinoline, a final show of rebellion before focusing on her freedom and leaving her former restraints behind. On I'll march my band out, I'll beat my drum, she marches to the middle of the runway with an ecstatic smile on her face, miming holding a marching bandleaders baton as she does so. She then stops marching and resumes her standard strutting, shimmying her shoulders on and if Im and doing jazz hands with her arms spread wide on fanned out. During your turn at bat, sir, she pulls a picture of the Wizard out of her bra and knowingly wags her finger at it on at least I didnt fake it as if to chastise him for his fraudulence. She gleefully rips the picture apart on Hat, sir and tosses it over her shoulder on I guess I didn't make it. She picks the skirt back up in her right hand and swoops it above her head on But whether I'm the rose of sheer perfection and twirls to the back of the runway with it in both hands as if it were her dance partner on A freckle on the nose of life's complexion. She kicks one leg out in front of her on the cinder and then stops, drops the skirt, rests her chin on her hands, and smiles at the judges, fluttering her eyelashes coyly on the long note of or the shiny apple of its eye. She excitedly leaps onto the skirt and slides down the runway as if riding a magic carpet on I gotta fly once, I gotta try once, putting her hand out to keep from sliding any further on Only can die once, and rolling her eyes on right, sir? Closing her eyes, she brings the skirt up to rub it against the side of her face, luxuriating in the feel of the fabric on Ooh, life is juicy, juicy and you see and mimes a snarling bite into the air on I gotta have my bite, sir. She stands up and wraps the skirt around her neck as if it were a superheros cape on Get ready for me love, 'cause I'm a ""comer"" and tiptoes to the front of the runway, taking a step with each word, on I simply gotta march, my heart's a drummer. She strikes a pose with one fist raised triumphantly in the air and her other hand on her hip on Don't bring around the cloud to rain on my parade. She removes the skirt from her shoulders, holding it in one hand, and Chasses to the left side of the runway with a bright, optimistic smile on her face and one hand over her heart on I'm gonna live and live NOW! and does the same in the opposite direction on Get what I want, I know how! She sweeps the skirt in front of her on One roll for the whole and then snaps it above her head and over her shoulder on shebang!. On One throw that bell will go clang, she steps back to the center of the runway, taking very high steps much like a dressage horse and clapping her hands once in front of her on Clang. On Eye on the target and, she pretends to be aiming a bow and arrow, pulling the bowstring back a bit further on each word and finally letting it go on Wham. She bounds back over to the now-ripped picture of the Wizard on the floor on One shot, one gun shot and bam! and flips the bird at the ripped pieces on Hey, Mr. Arnstein. She picks the skirt back up, steps to the front of the stage and slowly raises the skirt up and above her head on Here I Am, showing the words, I am Dr. Dillamond and Im an animal. DEAL WITH IT! to the judges once more. She tosses the skirt off the stage on I'll march my band out, and repeatedly stomps on the picture of the Wizard on I will beat my drum. She turns away from the ripped picture dismissively on And if I'm fanned out, and turns back to make eye contact with the judges on your turn at bat, sir, at least I didn't fake it. She mimes tipping an imaginary hat to the judges on hat, sir, and smiles and shrugs knowingly on I guess I didn't make it. She points confidently at the judges on get ready for me, love and kicks one leg out behind her on cause I'm a comer. She has both hands over her heart and a ridiculously happy look on her face as she leaps to her right on I simply gotta march, and flutters one hand over her heart on my heart's a drummer. She sweeps her right arm in front of her as if to clear the way ahead of her on Nobody, and points to the sky on on no, nobody. She puts one hand out in front of her as if to steady herself for the force of the songs final notes, and then finishes out the lip-sync with is gonna rain on my parade!, looking not at the judges but up to the sky, imagining her hope and optimism for the future.",2018-06-14 05:28:01

2070,"You are more likely an empath. As a clairsentient, you would feel sensations in different parts of your body because you are actually perceiving the astral realm and its impact on you. Some of us feel something crawling, fluttering, biting, slithering or causing sudden unaccountable pain and so on. As a clairsentient, you can actually know if someone's astral body is clean or not, by what you feel when that someone is next to you.

2072,"My fingers tremble as both my hands caress the curviness of the beautiful orange creation that was brought before my eyes. My mouth waters when I see the crisp's corners illuminate behind the faint glow of the candle light.

""We are finally alone, my love,"" I faintly say. Your Demetri is right here...

The Dorito looks at me with its luscious glow; yearning for me to have a little taste its sweet nectar of nacho cheese that it has in stored for me.

""I'll be easy on you, Baby,"" I murmured.

The hands that were shaking not too long ago finally, but faintly, clenched the glorious flavoured tortilla chip; sauntering the crisp with graceful elegance towards my face. My heart started to flutter faster and faster; my pupils dilated as the crisp touched my lips. The Dorito was slowly going in, but it was surely making an impression on my taste buds.

The savoury Nacho melted onto my quenchless tongue. I let out a groan of satisfaction when it emerged fully into my mouth; every nerve ending of my body released an unfamiliar tingle. My hands wrap themselves into a ball of what appeared to be a giant cheese ball; my head flails back with cheesy-goodness. This crisp was no ordinary crisp. This crisp was the one.

Before I could even flood my true love with my undying emotions, it was gone. My tongue frantically searches for it, but alas, the Dorito has dissolved. 

The candles infront of me started to blur with tears. 

In one night I have managed to find and lose my lover. My crisp. I decided to go to bed and have sweet dreams of my crisp when I hear a rustle from a distance. My torso turns around to see a bag of Doritos taller than me. Every happy emotion in me that was once dying was now alive again. I jump with my arms out in the open towards the bag; my mouth yelling out for its love.

""True Love will never die,"" I say as I wrap every limb onto the sexy bag.

""True Love will always be cheesy.""

Snow was melting and the air was crisp.  It seemed like birds were flying by to the music. Nothing too intense, just chill.

The worst was some ""smokey"" LSD.  Over at a friend's house at night with the feeling of wanting to itch constantly.  Shadows fluttered on the wall and people were watching Gladiator downstairs.  We ended up driving to the beach where I felt trapped in the car and lights flashing made me paranoid about cops.  Terrible experience every time I took that ""brand"" of LSD.",2018-06-14 07:30:35

2085,"I suppose I still struggle, so he's my two pence :

Growing up, I didn't really realise I was gay. My earliest memories of arousal were pretty much always of guys, but I didn't think that meant gay. 

I knew gay was a thing, a much ridiculed, hated thing, something about being something you're not or something. I only knew that as I watched movies about boys growing up and perving on girls, that it was just alien, and assumed I was just wrong inside. 

All my friends started talking about girls and bragging about caught sights or encounters. But I just knew I didn't fit in, and couldn't add to anything they talked about. It was around about then when most of my male friends fell away to be replaced by female friends. I didn't really think much of it at the time. 

By the time I was in high school, I was very much aware of a handful of ppl being ""gay"" but they were just a alien to me as the ""footy footy footy, boobs boobs boobs"" guys. They were all so effeminate and bitchy, and I just never associated myself with them. 

I think I was around 15 or 16 when I came to the realisation that I must be asexual, as I didn't seem to fit into any sexuality I'd ever heard of or was talked about, and quite frankly, the vehemence at which guys I felt at least a little aligned to would be disgusted by gayness, I just couldn't imagine myself as being it. 

The sheer prevalence of my perving over guys over the next few years found me unconsciously gravitating towards my eventual solo trip to a gay bar at 17. I still remember that first vision as I entered gingerly: two normal looking and acting guys talking to each other at a table between the entrance and the bar, just like any other bar, suddenly started to kiss, and really make out. My heart fluttered and I could not escape the sensation at all. I got very, very drunk on cheap whisky, vomited in the toilets, tried to resume, vomited again and left for home. 

Again and again, over the course of the next 2 years, I would sneak off towards the end of the night with my friends in town to have a few more before closing in these gay bars. The horrible music and bitchy alien effeminate guys was all I found again after, but I kept going. Eventually, I ended up at an after party, and ended up agreeing to sleep with one of the guys I didn't fancy, but it was an awakening. 

After that, by 19, and testing ""coming out"" on strangers, I felt more comfortable with being gay, and I eventually started coming out to pockets of friends. No one seemed to care really, and it hurt me. 

I spent my early twenties hanging round gay bars and pulling, but mostly they ended up in an awkward wank and a taxi home. That was until I was around 26 and a pull actually had sex with me. THAT was an awakening, but he was taken, so the search continued. 

7 years later, and a short nonsexual relationship with a great guy, and I'm wondering if there's any point in trying to be gay any more. Mental issues, for sure, but it just kept plaguing me. 

Around a year ago, I thought I'd try conditioning myself to tap into any potential sexuality towards girls, and started to bring myself to orgasm while focusing on girls, and for about 2 months or more, it worked. Worked far too well. But I was too chicken shit to try anything, and without conditioning it any more, it faded away again. 

So here I am, stuck, with no sense of direction. 

TL;DR: because of the way I grew up, I don't have a strong sense of any sexuality, so I can understand why ppl from similar backgrounds might go decades without realising they are gay or bi.",2018-06-14 10:28:46

2089,"I was stood at the rocky platform, the paint on the ground cracked and fading, the sheltered seating areas filled with holes. This train station was the strangest. My car had broken down, my phone had run out of battery and I found myself following signs towards a train station under the dimming sunset. 

I trailed across the hot concrete road, each step a huge victory against planting my head into the dirt and shrieking.

I found myself alone, at first, on the platform edge. That was until I spotted the stranger.

When he cast his gaze and locked eyes with me, I found I couldn't pry my sight elsewhere. Finding any interaction painstaking, I wanted to look anywhere but into the eyes of a stranger. I tried to twist my neck away but I couldn't move a muscle. 

His stare was extraordinary in how calm it was, like staring at the Moon's reflection in a still lake, the galaxy thrown behind it. My anxiety began to disperse away, each particle making me lighter, fluttering off into the wilderness without me. His eyes somehow glowed blue and I could see that he was dressed in dirty white sheets, slumped against a broken shelter. And I wanted to ignore the stranger but I was unable. 

His lips began to move just as the last light of the sunset scattered across the sky in a final burst of yellow. He mouthed, ""Next train is a crash.""

When I had understood his words, I managed to turn and follow the track lines into the far distance and heard the sudden screech of a train's breaks howling towards me. 

I stepped back in panic but my legs wouldn't move. The train popped around the corner, sparks of metal clashing bursting from the wheels, the high pitched scream unbearable. But I couldn't cover my ears. 

Then I saw the billowing black smoke blending into the dark sky, embers of red, orange and yellow bubbling from carriages further down. The train wasn't halting. Its speed hadn't slowed. It was hurling towards me where I stood too close to the edge, unable to lift my legs. I couldn't even close my eyes as the train rapidly approached me, bright sparks coming for my skin.

But then I found myself watching my body burn from a bird's eyes, watching my unmoving body crackle and fizzle along with the burning train, the stranger gone, no passengers inside, no sign of any emergency services coming, nothing. Just my body crumbling into dust.

There was a pat on my back. I opened my eyes, sat in my car on the side of the road, a trickle of blood making its way from my forehead to my chin. I couldn't move very well but could see in the cracked windshield that the stranger was in the back seat with a wide smile on his face.

I found the strength to kick down my crumpled door and fell to my knees. I kissed the dirt and lay on my back to watch the sunset set its magic show over the blue sky. The stranger creaked open the passenger door and plopped down beside me. I smiled, not that I knew why.

I didn't have any control over anything. Just the gentle calmness from when I first met the stranger's eyes that first time, his blue pearls as precious as my lost son's.

I held onto my shirt and tears filled my eyes. He was alive, that much I knew. Separated from me by distance. His mother was in another realm, a guardian angel unable to protect us from the world. I looked over at the stranger. But he was gone again. 

I didn't say a word as I heard sirens making their way towards me. I ignored how the tone was wrong, the pitch was wrong. I ignored how I knew it wasn't someone coming to save me. I just lay flat on the burning ground until I could smell my own flesh sizzling beside me. 

When I blinked I found myself floating behind my car as I swerved out of the way of roadkill, my alcohol infused self smashing into a lone old tree. I watched myself blank out, my head hit the wheel, the shattered windscreen testament to my suffering.

*God damn it.*

I stood at the platform edge again, the train just around the corner, out of sight, still hidden by silence.

I turned to the sitting stranger.

""What do you want?"" I yelled at him, my voice hoarse from the shots.

The stranger said nothing, transformed into the image of my wife as she was shot by a stray bullet when we hid from the rebels and the army. The blood drooled out and then, I saw my son in her arms, drinking from her breasts. She passed him to me once and he threw up on my shoulder. The image of my son's milky sick exploded in front of me until the train came towards me again, slower than before. 

I was on my knees begging once again when I found myself on the path towards the train station. The tears wouldn't come out and I tried to scream but my voice was gone. I lay flat on the ground once again, followed the streaks of the sunset like the fires from the bombs beyond us.

""I'm sorry,"" I whispered, ""I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.""

*I couldn't protect either of you.*

I stood at the platform once again as the train pulled up, no sign of a fire or the stranger. A gold carriage stopped in front of me and the doors opened to reveal my beautiful wife, ashes from the war stained on her skin, the remains of blood at her chest, my young son cradled in her arms. He opened his blue eyes, yawned, saw me and stretched out his arms. But the doors shut. My wife smiled and consoled my crying son as the golden carriage trailed off without me. 

*I'm sorry I couldn't protect you both.*

I was sat in my car again. But I was ready to accept my punishment. I spotted the stranger in the rear view mirror, his solemn expression free from pity. I nodded at him, saw the roadkill ahead, swerved.

The rock used to be purpleish and the architecture was more refined, looked like marble, instead of generic gray rock and delapidated architecture.

 This place looked like a dock at the end of the world at the edge of a mountain ridge, that open space between the mountains let you gaze in the distance into the unknown. 

In reignited it's just a closed off valley between the mountains. Nothing to wonder at, no gazing into the unknown.
Also the grass is generic green, I hoped they changed the shade of green to fit the original.

2103,"I own or have owned all of these except the Deco. 

The El Capistan is my favorite for tape emulation\-\-I use the fixed head mode which is akin to a Space Echo (the single mode you used in the shootout is based on an Echoplex). The secondary functions are very useful in dialing in a plethora of tones.

I didn't like the Nemesis's tape modes when I owned it, despite tweaking and deep\-diving on the Neuro app. The Neuro app definitely helped, but it still sounded like an average delay to me (some of the user presets did sound good, though but I hated using the app). You dialed it in very nicely in your video! I suspect the diffusion and subtle vibrato that you mentioned helped a lot\-\-the wow & flutter didn't sound natural to me unless it was just barely on.

The MultiStomp actually has 3 tape delay effects! I managed to get a decent tape sound out of the algorithm you used. You can get a nice voicing and it seems to have an extremely subtle modulation to it\-\-almost imperceptible. It's definitely not my go\-to, though. The Tape Echo 3 features an emulated Echoplex preamp, which changes the dry signal as you discovered. I kind of like that one with distortion, but less so with clean tones. The third is the Drive Echo, which is a copycat of the Tube Echo from the Line 6 M\-series which replicates an EP\-1 Tube Echoplex. It has drive and modulation controls and I find it better when set to ""thru"". My newer El Capistan patch uses the DualDigiD algorithm and I managed to get in the ballpark with its tone and filter controls, despite not being a tape\-specific algorithm.

The Digidelay came from the period when tape emulations tended to sound dark, almost like an analog delay. This is also true of the Ibanez DE\-7's echo mode, which is billed as a tape imitator. I like the Digidelay's tape mode, but I agree it doesn't have many artifacts associated with tape. ",2018-06-14 12:20:11
2104,"Sorry but, you are comparing apples with oranges (Flutter vs Native Android).

Flutter is a framework which is build from scratch, you cannot compare it with a 10 years old project.
Flutter kept 0 compatibility with the native ecosystem.

If Native Android did the same, then it would be way better than it is now, but would be that useful? i doubt...

For the record, Flutter doesn't use anything from the Native View layer. Everything has been reimplemented. So all this UI libraries are gone...

Even if flutter was written with kotlin, then you would still need to rewrite all of your UI from scratch.

2105,"[](/spikehappy) I personally like obscure unexpected ships. And I don't mean crackships, but ones that you would never think about, but then somebody brings it up and it works so well.

Something like:

[](/sp)

[](/flutterblush) [](/raritysquee) **Rarity x Fluttershy** - I know, this one doesn't count as obscure and unexpected, but it's also far from being the most popular. But I personally think it just works really well. They both seem like they really get each other. They are opposites, but aren't total opposites. Their differences don't clash, they make a great balance. They differ in all the right ways and I could really see a flourishing relationship between them.

[](/sp)

[](/lyra) [](/twidaw) **Lyra x Twilight** - This is probably my personal holy grail of obscure shipping. I'm pretty sure there is only [a single one-shot fic](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/401723/a-slight-detour) about it and I was the one who wrote it. But to me it just seems like such a natural pair and I seriously can't believe that practically nobody has thought of it before.

I see them both as a scientist type. But while Twilight is more of the pragmatic, hard-reason sort of scientist, Lyra is more of a dreamer, who's driven by sheer curiousity. And you put them in the same room and the interaction practically writes itself. Even personality-vise, Twilight is reasonable enough to stay on the ground, but flexible enough to be able to deal with Lyra's endless imagination. But at the same time, Twilight is the anchor that keeps Lyra on the ground, kind of like how Bon Bon does, but that's another ship. And they both make each-other think in ways they've never done before.

It's a very intellectual relationship, one where both of them can grow. I mean LyraBon is a fine ship as well and has many of the same qualities. But it's way too ubiquitous. Cadence and Shining Armor are officially married and they still have more ships than these two. I think both of them deserve to have their own orgies of ships, just like most other characters have. And if you ask me, Twyra is a perfect candidate for a new one.

2114,"9. DOD Carcosa: The last one entering my board, and so far i am loving it. I already have a super versatile fuzz pedal, but this one covers fuzz territory untouched by my UF01. I was looking for a fuzz pedal that could work great with leads. Whereas the UF01 can sound as big muff, a fuzz face or a tonebender, Carcosa makes quite apparent that it shares some sonic DNA with a fuzzrite, a super fuzz and a treble booster. Again, youtube demos focus on the splattery fuzz side of the carcosa, but it sounds killer as fuzzy OD for stuff like QOTSA tones. Stoner? No problem. Frusciante's slane castle oversaturated fuzzy leads? You are in the right place kid. The before knob controls how much gain you get, the after knob acts as a bias knob that ranges from smooth, massive fuzz tones to spluttery goodnes. I'm still on the tweaking phase with this one, but right now my settings are hali voicing, before 10:00 - 11:00 ( depending on how much i want to watch the world burn) after 10:00, output 12:00 and HC 9:00. This setting adds a fuzzy edge in top of my overdriven amp tone that works really great with everything. If i feel like shredding, i always catch myself being generous with the after knob. Of course, it is fuzz, so it is not for everyone, but for me is a keeper.

10. Dunlop ZW45: pretty standard wah pedal with a wide range of sweep, which starts maybe a little bit more bassy than your regular crybaby. I bought mine inspired by Frusciante use of it on The Empyrean. I run the wah AFTER drive pedals because it has a more dramatic sweep this way. And that's about it! Shred on this!

11. Zoom PD01: Along with the Echo Park, probably the heart of my rig. This thing is the best light overdrive you never heard of. Apparently it was born after Zoom's attempt in the 90s of building their own klon. How close it is to the real deal? Dunno, never tried the real deal. My ex bassist had a soul food, and while they were similar sounding, i think the PD01 with the gain off sounded less boxy, so not the same pedal. Whatever, i've built all my tones with this ugly grey pedal always on. It is the responsible parent of my setup, it makes everything sound bigger, more focused, and prevents my fuzzes from melting too many faces. I always tune the room with the bass and treble knobs on it, but on my rehearsal room remain @12:00. With the gain off, the low end focuses, while making everything else sound bigger. Since the amount of gain doesn't change too much from 8:00 to 12:00, the right way to think about the gain knob is as a mid knob. I left mine @9:00. Really like the character it adds to my sound!

12. Line 6 Echo Park: Another pedal that is dearest to my heart. The Echo Park was released by Line 6 on the Jeorge Tripps era, the same team that designed the DL4. The foundation to this pedal is the DL4. It doesn't have a looper mode, but it does have an improved tape echo mode, which it isn't included on the M series. That mode alone is worth the price tag, and is exclusively the only mode i use. The flutter/wow is really a thing of beauty, it simulates the modulation made by a worn out tape and the echo park does a really great work at it. The overall character of the tape mode is on the warm/dark side, which works quite well with saturated gutars, while also adding depth that is more appatent on clean-ish tones. The tap tempo is really well thought and easy to use. The bad sides are that when switched off, the buffer really sucks a bit of the treble off the signal, but mine is switched on and off the signal by the Joyo Pxl Live looper, so not an issue. It does adds a slight volume increase when it is on, but i believe it can be adjusted by an internal trimpot. The rotary mode switch on mine was acting a bit faulty, jumping sometimes from one mode to another mid song. Some people reported the same issues with their units, which is caused by dust accumulation on the core module. After removing the core module and carefully cleaning the connection between the dock and the module, i haven't experienced that issue again. Tip for y'all!

13. Vox Delaylab: Is this the biggest multidelay ever made? Maybe. It is worth, though, because of how good sounding the delays on this unit are. The options are so vast, it actually feels like a delay lab. The delays are lively, organic and warm. People who like more sterile, cleaner delays won't like this one, of course. Just a matter of personal taste. I use mine for modulated analog ambient delays, dirty tube echo, multihead tape slapback, weird rythmic delays and dotted digital delays ala The Edge. I control the repeats on every preset with my Moog EP3. It is also capable of great spring and shimmer verbs. I even made a phaser only preset on it, which speaks of how versatile this thing is. So yeah, think about it as an improved DL4 with less looper options. Can't come with any bad side apart from the size. Thing is huge!

14. Zoom MS70CDR: The hype is real! What can i say about this wonderful pedal that hasn't been said before on this sub? Most of the algos on this are based on already existing ones by other builders. What it lacks in originality, it makes up for options and creativity. You can stack as many effects as the DSP is able to manage without overloading (more or less, 6 effects at the same time, depending on the DSP requirements of each one). Some of the algos are a bit of a hit or miss. The phasers and pitch shifters would need a bit of work, buth the choruses, reverbs and delays on this one are just brilliant. I use mine mainly for reverbs and synth presets. The guys on the zoommultistomp make some awesome presets that will bring life to your old multistomp pedal, and they are really expanding the options of what this pedal can do. The usb input could be used to make this pedal midi operated, and i'm currently eyeing on getting a midi interface for it, so i'm not even remotely close to taking full advantage from this beast. However, preset making can be a bit tedious if you are not into tweaking eq curves on each bank.

15. Line 6 Tap Tremolo: Bought it for 20. I've used for the most time i had this pedal the opto mode, but i recently grown fond of the bias mode, since it has more of that flint harmonic tremolo vibe to it. If you are into tap tempo tremolos, you should really take a look at this one, since people sell them for super cheap. The peak knob is super fun for choppy crazyness that plays according to the player's dynamics. I use it in a couple tunes and it does a great job, then again i'm not a big tremolo guy.

16. Digitech Jamman Looper: Finally! We made it through the last pedal on my board! Congratulations reddit! Jamman is a straightfoward looper that makes looping quite easy, even on the fly looping. Some of our songs are heavily centered on loops, so it's an integral part of my songwriting. I can't really think of nothing i can add to this review. I think guitar players that use looping struggle to find something that makes loop easy, and the jamman excels at that.

So that's it. I should mention, though, that most of my pedals are operated by my joyo pxl live looper, which also switches the banks on my 11R. Power wise, everythings is feed by 2 power supplies (fame dct200 and vitoos iso4, for the more current hungry stompboxes) hidden at the back of my pedalboard (harley benton spaceship 80)

So yeah, hope that you like my board. Let me know if you have any more questions, an feel free to write your thoughts.

2131,"I'm a male, 32 years old, diagnosed at birth (discovered through meconium ileus). 
I am married to a fantastic, strong, driven woman. I also have a brother with CF. 

- I don't hate my parents.... There are lots of things they could have done better, and lots of things I've had to forgive them for unrelated to CF. I believe they did the best they knew how to do in a terrible marriage with two sick kids. They taught us to fight for life. I took care of myself/my own health, meals, laundry and education from the moment I was capable of doing treatments, reaching the pantry and lifting the laundry myself. They also did their best to give us the freedom to test our own boundaries and capabilities. They never treated me or my brother like we were invalids, 'sicklings' or incapable of doing great things with our lives. As a child I never thought of myself as 'sick' because they never treated me like I was. Cystic Fibrosis never defined me or our family. CF, hospital visits, sickness... it was just that happened, you worked through it the best you could, and you picked yourself up and moved forward with life. 

- Hospital stays: I think I expect so much of myself that being in the hospital was/is an irrefutable excuse for doing nothing. I suppose because being in the hospital sucks (I hate needles and procedures) I do my best to make it 'fun' by allowing myself to just goof off on my computer for hours/days, to not work at all and just 'be bored'- things I rarely allow myself to do at home where I always have an ongoing 'todo' list in my head and goals to work towards. So it makes it almost like a 'reward' for having to be sick/in the hospital. 

- Emotions and Goals: When I was a teenager I went through a HUGE depression. At the time the life-expectancy was about 25 years and I really took that to heart. I didn't see any point in making plans past 5-10 years in the future. 
But when I was late teens something sort of snapped inside me and I decided that if I only get one life to live, I didn't want to live it moping. I had dreams I wanted to achieve and even if I didn't reach them, I'd rather die ON MY WAY to them than have little to show for my life. So I started setting myself goals, writing out dreams, and doing all I could to reach them. 
I realized that I did roughly 3 hours a day of treatments, and if instead of watching TV/playing games during that time, I watched tutorials and listened to educational materials for 2-3 hours a day, I should have some marketable skills. So I used treatments as a time to learn: During nebs when my hands were free I would practice and create things, then during CP (where my hands are stuck holding Flutter/Acapella) I would watch tutorials and learn something I could practice/implement in my next neb time.
After awhile I knew enough that I could take on small jobs when I could get them. Now I have long-term contracts, am making higher than the national-average income and have almost complete autonomy/flexibility in my work. Over the past years I have gotten knocked down, especially after rough health updates or tough life circumstances, but I've never fully fallen into a 'pit' of despair again... just bouts of ennui or temporary depression, then I would re-focus on my goals and move forward. 

- Goals: I've discovered that if I don't have goals, I get depressed and my health starts to decline. I'm a personality that HAS to have something I'm fighting towards, or else I forget that I should be fighting/what I'm fighting for. So I have LOTS of goals. And I realize I won't hit all my goals, but I'll be damned if I'm not going to try. Plus, I have an incredible wife and (though I know she's fully capable of caring for herself) I want to have a lot to leave her when I die. So I'm going to work as hard as possible to become an expert in my field of work, build wealth, pay off our house, and leave her with as many assets and opportunities as I can. 

- As a disclaimer: I feel VERY lucky/blessed. My doctors say I am 50% Driven/Diligent with my health, and 50% just plain lucky that I am currently as health as I am.
I DO believe that as I make goals, I manage my health better so that I have more capacity to work/fight towards my goals.
It feels like a revolving cycle for me: A. Be inspired by goal, B. Fight to be healthy enough to achieve said goal, C. Work towards goal until I see progress, D. Start back at A....

The reason Dart ended up being picked was that its compiler tool chain essentially provided one of the features they wanted out of the box, which is hot reloading.

Dart ships with multiple back ends to its compiler. In production mode it produces native ARM code, and in Dev mode it compiles to byte code that is run by a JIT compiler. Getting that level of flexibility to develop hot reloading was a no brainer  for the flutter team.",2018-06-14 15:39:41

The sounds of laughter slice through the silence. Echoing through the vents I hear both feminine and masculine voices. My emotional detector flashes he words happiness and joy across my vision. Not recognizing these emotions, I frown. The shackles holding my arms above me jingle as I shift to the other side of the wall, closer to the vent. Though Im surrounded by darkness - not a shred of light weeping through the bars of my cell or he bent above me - my night vision allows me to see everything. Rust squeaks as my joints are moved in ways they havent been able to in years. The amount of times water has flooded my cell and the surrounding hallway is unaccounted for. Closing my eyes, I set my sensors on high and searched the area around me for some sort of connection, a signal. A beep informed me that indeed, there was a very faint connection. A spark of something fluttered in my chest as I focused on connecting to the source.

Moments tick by and a shriek pierces my thoughts, startling me. Frustrated, I concentrate harder, turning off the ability to hear. My foot vibrates and blinks green. The first time its ever been green in the 10 years I have existed. The word hope flashes across my eyes as I contort my hand to free myself from the chains. I stand up and every metal part of me groans in protest. I reach my hand up into the vents and try getting a better signal.
The green blinks faster until it stays on. I bite my lip as images and memories flood my brain. A young girl and a young boy playing catch with The Creator in a sunny park. The Creator sitting on a bed reading the two other Weapons a story. My hand clenches into a fist. Rage repeats across my vision in bright red lettering. A danger warning. Accessing my hearing again, I listen for the sounds of happiness. A dog barks, the sound vibrating through the vents into my ear. I touch the back of my hand and press a button. The dog whines in agony as the small voices begin to get panicked. I can hear His voice as he tries to calm the children. I press the button again, then once more. Two thumps sound above me. Silence once more.

Triumphant, I sit back down and shackle up my hands above me. Running footsteps and soft weeps come closer as the metal doors are pulled open with effort. Enraged, The Creator opens my cell and glares at me. Innocently I say, What? Its not like I couldve done it. Im all tied up remember? He ground his jaw and took several steps toward me before crouching down to look me in he eye.
Why? Tears streak down his face and I grin.
I saved them from the inevitable. The empty cells down the hall were for them, no? He leans back on his heels. 
You were an accident. An abomination. They didnt deserve your wrath.
But you do, isnt that right? Suddenly I kick out my leg, my foot cracking against his skull as I slip out of the chains. I grip his hair and slam it into the sharp nail jutting from the floor. I dislodge his skull, then slam it down again, and again, and again. Any warning signs and beeps are lost in the background as I continue to mutilate The Creator.

 Since George Lucas was heavily inspired by Eastern myth, its possible the whills are something akin to the eight immortals of Chinese myth or the rishis of Indian mythology, immortal enlightened beings who could see the past, the present and the future.  
Here is a quote I found about the eight immortals which sounds a lot like the force ghosts and force priestess Yoda met\-  
 *They are immune to heat and cold, untouched by the elements, and can  fly, mounting upward with a fluttering motion. They dwell apart from the  chaotic world of man, subsist on air and dew, are not anxious like  ordinary people, and have the smooth skin and innocent faces of  children. The transcendents live an effortless existence that is best  described as spontaneous. They recall the ancient Indian ascetics and  holy men known as i who possessed similar traits.*   


The midichlorians could be the individual soul communicating with the higher beings i.e. these whills.

To be fair to the new lucasfilm comic writers, they may have co\-opted some of the ideas that George Lucas had in comics like the Han Solo comic where he interacted with glowing orbs referred to as 'witnesses'. Those could be a manifestation of the whills.

Heres my experience, in case useful: when I wanted off the family plan (slightly different than what youre trying to do but the same in that it was making an account change), the company told me I had to get permission from the account holder (uBPD mother) to make ANY changes, ie she had to speak to them herself to authorize it. I said nope. Keep in mind I had the password  I just wasnt the literal account holder. They then said they would call her while I was on the line and connect the lines so I could ask her for permission with a company rep present. Although uncomfortable, I explained why I wasnt going to do that either. After speaking with their corporate office about any loopholes in the system etc, in the end, they made the change and settled for emailing my mother the update. I kept my old phone number but just transferred to my own plan.

Re: baby...I wouldnt tell her if I were you. If shes like mine, she will bring a level of intensity to things, in general, that just puts already stressful situations over the top. I told my mother; she was emotionally flat about it and then didnt respect boundaries. Eg I let them know the baby was coming but not to come down to the hospital (huge feelings of disgust and panic having her in the delivery room) but she and eDad came down anyway and camped right outside the room. Saw her through the windows and door fluttering right outside. As soon as my baby was born, she was there pressed against the glass looking.

2164,"Well, lets think about it. The death of a loved one can be extremely painful. And having pain is a way of hurting. But is feeling pain necessarily a bad thing?

My belief is that its not what happens in our lives, its the story we make up about what is happening. 

For instance what if Grandma dies and we believe in reincarnation to the extent that we tell ourselves that she is the new butterfly that continues to flutter near the kitchen window every morning.  Perhaps we tell ourselves its Grandma visiting us, letting us know she is alright and that she still loves us. That makes us smile. 

We tell ourselves stories about what is happening all the time, even the weather! We use these words: terrible, nasty, beautiful, dreary, crisp, etc, to describe the weather. When really the weather possesses none of those qualities. It just IS. 

And so it is with death. Death is as appropriate an event as life. There isnt one minute goes by everyday without someone dying. Or being born. 

So how can we ascribe bad to that very natural and universal process known as dying? But, more importantly, *why* would we describe it as such ?

After a long pull from the bottle, I settled into my book.

But it didnt last. My eyes kept getting drawn to the picture, *the* picture, of her. Of us. I could feel the sobs building up in my chest, could feel the weight of it all threatening to collapse down upon me when I reached out for the phone almost reflexively. I needed something. We could just talk. 

Hello, room service, I need  umm  something, my voice was shaking almost as bad as my hand. 

The woman on the other end was cheery, professional, and the pinnacle of polite. 

Yes, of course sir. Would you like any customization options, or would you like whatever is first available? Of course, you can change your mind at any moment. The FSI is all about customer satisfaction.

I stammered, swallowing a sob, Whatever you have will be lovely. Thank you so much, then I slammed down the receiver before she could say anything else.

Stupid, I thought, I didnt even give her my room  but I couldnt finish my thought before there was a knock at the door.

Come in, I called, quickly downing the beer and hiding the book.

I cant, came a quiet reply. 

I slapped my forehead in frustration and darted across the room to open the door. Standing before me in a prim navy pantsuit was a petite woman. Her hair was deep black and shined like the lava rock that dotted the resorts grounds, with eyes a piercing baby blue. Her makeup was striking, but not overly done, dark liner accentuating her eyes, crimson lips drawing attention to their fullness. 

Hello there, Mr. Haller, the front desk said youd like some company. Im Zara.

I stood there, befuddled, as she walked right passed me. She guided me back into the suite gently, then shut the door behind us. Taking my hand, she led me over to the recliner and beckoned for me to sit again.

Its a lot to take in.

I assumed she was talking about the island, but it could have been the resort. I felt her hands, tenderly massaging my shoulders. 

There are so many options available here, Mr. Haller, that I understand it can be difficult to know where to start. But dont fret. 

Her hands slid lower, as she stood next to me, her lips fluttering against my earlobe and down my neck. One hand slid down my stomach, fingers pointed toward my belt, before gently cupping my crotch. 

I took this job to make people feel good. And, Id like to think Im pretty good at knowing what people need. So just sit back, she squeezed my crotch then, sliding down to kneel between my legs, And let me make you feel good. If at any point you want me to stop, or switch things up, just tell me what you need. 

I leaned back and closed my eyes, my world reduced to sounds. The clinking of my belt buckle coming undone. The hum of my zipper parting. Then soft, wet kisses as her lips explored around my shaft. I could feel myself growing harder, though also the undeniable flush of embarrassment creeping into my cheeks. 

And then, the room went silent, and the only thing in my world was the warm, wet sensation of her mouth guiding my cock deep into her throat. She did so effortlessly, no gagging or choking, just a smooth movement which buried every inch of my manhood deep in her throat. Her tongue slipped forward then, surprisingly long, delicately lapping at the base of my shaft. Zaras hand moved up to cup my balls, her fingers deftly caressing me to bring forth maximum pleasure. 

Oh, god yessss, my words were drawn out and guttural. 

With a pop, she freed my cock from her mouth. When I opened my eyes, I saw her holding her beautiful, pale breasts together, engulfing my cock in her cleavage. 

You needed this, Mr. Haller. You need this release. Doesnt it feel good to have me at your beck and call? Anything you need, she licked her lips for emphasis, bouncing her tits up and down, Anything, and I can make it happen.

I groaned and leaned back, as Zara began to bob up and down, taking my cock in long strokes. I could feel her throat clinging to me as she pushed down further than Id ever experienced. Then shed pull back, so only the head of my cock was in her mouth, applying suction and swirling her tongue in ways that caused my fingers to sink deep into the armrests of my chair and my toes to curl. 

Fuuuuuck.

My body went slack, my eyes unfocused, as I gave in to the ministrations of Zaras mouth. She was right. I needed this. Needed her. Needed more than just her. I could feel the frustration and desire within me reach a boiling point, then reached out with both hands and grabbed her head. I fucked her face mercilessly, ramming her down again and again, feeling her spit and my precum leak down my shaft and pool beneath my balls, which her fingers were still massaging with expert precision. 

The tightness within me appeared out of nowhere. I hadnt thought sexually in weeks, but suddenly, the need to cum was overwhelming. I tried to moan out a warning, but just as I pulled Zaras head down to fully enclose my cock, I felt the twitching begin.

My cum shot in a spurt directly into her throat. Her left hand, wrapped around my calf, squeezed tight to the point that one of her nails broke skin. It was the only time the entire encounter that she gagged, a full-body convulsion ran through her as she struggled to open herself to my orgasm. Zara was a consummate professional, she never lost her grip on my cock, steadying herself with deep breaths through her nose, and swallowing every last drop. 

Slowly, she eased her head back, applying heavy suction and short bobbing motion to draw forth the last of my cum and make me feel so many things at once I thought I may black out. 

You were...incredible, I said as she dabbed daintily at a smidgen of cum on the corner of her mouth.

Correction, Mr. Haller, I *am* incredible. And Im available the rest of this afternoon if youd like to find out. But for now, just relax and enjoy your moment. Youll find plenty of opportunities to acquaint yourself with our services throughout your stay. May I suggest the full-service dinner tonight on the patio? Look for the table with the green umbrella, Im usually at seat thirteen for dinners. 

Zara leaned down to give me a teasing glimpse of her cleavage, then blew me a kiss, slapped her ass and set off from my room with a jaunty swing of her hips. I collapsed back into the chair, uncertain if I knew who I was in this moment and even less certain if I cared.

[](/raritypaper) Chapter 3: Welcome to Firelink Shrine

You know? Im enjoying this a lot more than I expected. Thank you for this. The wind swept through his mane for the first time in decades as he lay clutched in the ravens claws. Chirps answered his thanks as they flew over great forests and desecrated townships at speeds greater than even he had gone in his heyday. SoWhere exactly are we going? Quick Silver asked his captor.

Creee! The crow shrieked in reply as it swooped up a mountain, its wings fluttered in the Jetstream. Quick Silver gasped as the full moon crested over the clouds above them.

Could I ask a favor of you?

Chrp? The Raven twitched its head to the side listening to its captive.

Could we go as high up as you can and do a flip in the glow of the full moon? he hesitantly asked, I used to do it before, his wings twitched, well before.

Chrp. The Great Raven nodded and began to flap its wings harder, faster, until the pair of them were speeding upwards into the night sky until they pierced through the shrouding clouds, bathing the two winged beings in the light of the full moon. The pair basked in the pale glow for several calm minutes until the raven flipped over and dove back through the clouds towards a basin covered in ruins. Turning back upright Quick Silver saw their flight taking them past a towering fortress and over a misty forest. A few great flaps had them flipping into a loop as they passed an aqueduct and Quick Silver felt the ravens talons release him left to glide downwards towards what appeared to be a ruined shrine of some sort.

Come on. Nice and easy. Thats it. He struggled to keep a steady downward descent, but managed to land in the center of the shrine ruins next to a roaring bonfire. Quick Silver sat before the bonfire and rested until a sardonic voice broke his rest.

Well look what the flying chicken brought in. Another less useful chicken. Speaking to him was a griffin clad in chainmail roosting upon the ruined remains of a wall. Let me guess. Youre another chicken brought to the slaughter.

Quick Silver got up and walked towards the armored griffin. And you are?

The names Gilda. Knight of Griffonstone.

I am Quick Silver. Former Mercenary to the lords of Saddle Arabia and other significant parties.

Gilda smirked at him. Clearly not significant enough to not get locked away. Did you enjoy your time in the coop.?

Quick Silver snarled Listen here feed for brains. I am only on this pilgrimage to keep a debt. So, tell me what you know or shut it!

Her talons glistened as she snarled back It was a joke Quick to anger. Back off!

The two glared at one another until they both found themselves laughing at the other, both extending a forelimb. Gilda.

Quick.

So. The Pilgrimage huh? Gilda scratched her head, Dont know why youd want to do that, but its no skin off my gizzard. What do you want to know?

Quick Silver paused and thought back to what Filthy Rich s family saying, Do you know where I might find the bell of awakening?

Gilda laughed, You dont know anything do you? All right, heres the deal. The Bell of Awakening is above the Undead Berg maybe a few minutes that way. She pointed over the canyon to the top of the wall. And the other bell is...

Other bell?

She smirked, Yeah the other bell is way below us. Not as easy to get to unfortunately, there are massive bugs that attack anyone who tries to fly down there. . . but then you should have no issues with that huh?

Quick Silver gritted his teeth and shook her claw once more. My thanks for the help Gilda. I suppose I should head off.

Gilda laughed at his politeness, Ease up on the stiffness there champ. Its not as if youll succeed anyway. Sides before you leave you should go introduce yourself to the mute and the dweeb back there.

Quick Silver blinked in confusion. Who?

Gilda pointed to a nearby stairwell The mute is in a cell right down there. She keeps this fire going and is a great listener. She tolled her eyes and pointed a talon over her shoulder in the opposite direction The obnoxious dweeb is back there. I wont blame you for not talking to him though.

To brag about their own acomplishements, only ever stopping long enough to get me to agree with them. (""Yes, of course you are an incredible person and I love you so much even though we've only just met!"" Right.)

It's even safer if they just get so flustered with anxiety and caught up in their own head that they never listen to me. (Though if they start babbling nonsense, it's kinda hard to tell between social anxiety and insanity. One girl actually ran out of the restaurant when we met, babbling some nonsense about a cat needing surgery. Turns out she was just shy.)

I've tried giving up the dating scene completely. I really have. My Eldrich buddies all tell me ""Just get a one-night stand, it gets you all that good stuff you need without the talking."" 

And I mean, they can't get to understand me if we never talk.

But like they say in all the chick-flicks that I watch (purely for research purposes, I can see your eye starting to twitch, stop thinking about me, think of Sandra Bullock or Anne Hathaway, quick!), I just want to connect with someone.

I just want someone to love.

I gave in again, after holding out for so long. I was proud for staying away from the humans for so long. I told myslf that all I needed was to stare into someone's eyes for the duration of a meal, even if they started that tell-tale twitch. 

Maybe this one will last longer, I thought. She seemed distracted all the time, which was good. It meant I got my date and she could keep her mind away from me.

Then she started talking.

""What I've always loved about roses is how the colours taste like velour,"" she said softly, staring at the flowers I'd given her. She brushed them gently with her delicate fingers and sighed. ""Just lovely. Thank you,"" she smiled at me. Her eyes didn't quite look at my face though as her head tilted a bit to watch the waiter walk past with breadsticks for another table. 

I cleared my throat. ""Well, Ophelia, tell me about yourself. Your profile said you like pies, do you bake a lot?""

""Hmm?"" she looked back at me, her wide eyes drifting over me like unmoored rafts. ""Oh pies are something I make with plastic."" She reached for her purse and delicatly presented me with a pie-shaped keychain. ""This one is cherry,"" she said. ""See the red colour?""

""Very pretty,"" I agreed with a smile.

She tilted her head and smiled slowly at me, still holding out her purse. Her eyelids fluttered, but still weren't twitching. ""You have a nice face,"" she said. I was at a loss for words there, most people don't look too closely at my face. I had the worst of it hidden beneath a very realistic human mask, but some people could still ""see"" the darkness laying just underneath it all. 

""Are your eyes grey?"" she asked.

I nodded, awkwardly. They were grey, blue, green, purple, red... depended on the day.

She seemed to consider something. Absently she leaned forward, focusing a little too much for my comfort. Or hers, eventually...

""You're one of them, aren't you?"" she asked in a conspiratorial whisper. 

It was my turn to tilt my head. ""One of who?""

""The Old ones..."" she whispered, getting more excited. ""I'd met one like you before. She was a nice friend. She made my brain feel funny, in like a pleasant."" She paused, pursing her lips. ""She said that if I focused more, my brain would feel even funnier. Does that work with you?""

""I don't think you want that to happen..."" I started to say. Then I paused. She'd interacted with another Eldrich before and was still in one piece. Maybe...

BY EDWIN ARLINGTON ROBINSON

Whenever Richard Cory went down town,
We people on the pavement looked at him:
He was a gentleman from sole to crown,
Clean favored, and imperially slim.

And he was always quietly arrayed,
And he was always human when he talked;
But still he fluttered pulses when he said,
""Good-morning,"" and he glittered when he walked.

And he was richyes, richer than a king
And admirably schooled in every grace:
In fine, we thought that he was everything
To make us wish that we were in his place.

So on we worked, and waited for the light,
And went without the meat, and cursed the bread;
And Richard Cory, one calm summer night,
Went home and put a bullet through his head.",2018-06-14 22:46:58
2197,"A few tips Ive picked up:


1. Trading on paper for a few more months is a great idea, but we all know youre not gonna do it because nobody does.

2. When you start trading for real, start small. Trade the smallest lots you can. If your heart still flutters when placing a trade, youre not ready to trade bigger. 

3. Learn how swap rates work and take them into heavy consideration. I dont know about OANDA, but any broker worth their salt will make those figures accessible.

4. Learn patience. The higher the timeframe, the higher likelihood of profitability. Patterns dont begin to properly manifest until the 4h timeframe - below this the market will appear to behave irrationally and will be impossible to predict. Nobody makes consistent profits trading the 5m charts and you wont either. If for no other reason, the spreads will eat you alive. 

5. Indicators are a great way of telling you what has already happened. They can be helpful in determining some things (e.g. trend strength) but they are not a crystal ball. Look at them but dont rely on them.

6. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. This is not a get rich quick scheme. If someone tries to tell/sell you as such, walk away.


Good luck and happy trading. ",2018-06-14 22:58:31

I often fantasize about being an arabian nights style harem/dancer/slavegirl to a merchant or sultan.  I got my very first ""warm and tinglies"" as a little girl when Jafar magics jasmine into her skimpy slavegirl outfit and shackles.  The idea of being at the beck and call of someone who doesn't really care for me as anything but property and decoration, kept in chains, hand and foot, and expected even to dance in them is just...mmmm. overpowering.  


But that's not all that uncommon.  The real reason I made a throwaway is because my absolute hottest fantasy is to be publicly hanged.  As a sacrifice, for a crime I didn't commit, or a princess  or noble lady captured by an invading army, for whatever reason, I find myself being lead to the gallows in a town square wrists pinioned behind my back, with hundreds, even thousands of eyes watching as a noose is tightened around my throat and an executioner kicks a stool out from under me or hoists me into the air, putting my suffering and death on display to a cheering crowd...and I'm completely helpless to do anything about it.  The brutal struggle as the noose crushes my throat, contrasted against the serene aftermath of a dangling body, the hem of my dress fluttering in the breeze.

[](/flutterthink) So from what I can tell you are trying to do something similar to how ponies the anthology goes with a bunch of short clips of separate jokes.  I do really like that format for videos so I'll try to keep an eye on your channel. [](/bonexcited)




As a heads up, everything here is just my opinion, so don't accept anything as 100% fact because I'm usually wrong.





[](/twigood) Looking at the things I think you did a good job on, a few of the jokes I consider to be better ones were [this one](https://youtu.be/tshlh8W6PT4?t=46), [this](https://youtu.be/tshlh8W6PT4?t=490), and 34 sec into the my little pony one.  They use well recognizable jokes at appropriate timings and there is enough of the show clip used to give context for the joke.







[](/sillylie) On the not too good side of things, I didn't understand how a lot of the clips were meant to be funny.  For example, [here](https://youtu.be/tshlh8W6PT4?t=213) you have Fallout NV title music with a character walking.  Forgive me if I don't get it due to ignorance, but what exactly is the joke here? This is the biggest negative part for me is that I don't understand/find a lot of the clips funny.  


Another thing is your repetition of jokes, particularly the ""wasted"" one, I don't think fits.  I get running jokes but most of the situations you used didn't really fit the outline for the ""wasted"" meme.  You need something sudden or unexpected leading to the collapse or death or w/e, but a couple times you used things where the cause was obvious or the action itself too slow.  




[](/cheerteach)  Overall I think it can be good with refinement, but as it stands currently it feels unpolished.  Try to not give yourself time requirements on the videos, pushing to fill spaces will lead to dead jokes and bad videos.  Focus on making good and funny clips over anything else, a great sense of humor makes great videos.  Lastly, I want to say again that each of these points are only my opinion.  Look at what others say before you take action on anything said here.

2216,"In the absence of any better options, I proposed that we try to make our way to the laboratorys archives, in hopes that it would have spell scrolls or other items that we could somehow combine to cheese our way to victory. We ignored all of the seals we passed, and did our best to avoid anything that looked like a boss. Upon entering the archives, our DM mentioned that we found a shriveled corpse holding an elaborately decorated box containing a deck of cards.

Nope nope nope. We checked the shelves to see if there was a solution that didnt involve the Deck of Many Things. The DM proceeded to roll to see what the spell scrolls on the shelves were.

Some were pointless. Some would have been useful if Id been high enough level to cast them.

And one was a scroll of Wish.

Now, our DM had a houserule that if you tried to cast a spell from a spell scroll and failed the DC, you suffered magical backlash based on how powerful the spell was. In this case, the DM told me that if I failed the roll, Id basically be instantly vaporized. I did the math. I had to roll at least an eleven. I had exactly fifty-fifty odds.

Panicking slightly from the pressure, I started paging through the Players Handbook, looking for some way to improve my odds. I couldnt find any. Losing patience, our rogue declared that she was pulling a card from the Deck of Many Things.

She proceeded to vanish, the card fluttering gently to the floor.

Well one party member was already down. We were out of options. I read the scroll, and rolled to see if I got better than a ten.

NAT

FUCKING

ELEVEN

Once I finished shouting in relief, I very carefully considered my wish. Id confirmed as best as I could that it was the goddess of knowledge whod been sealed away. However, I was worried that the seals would have protections against being broken via magic. Id tested this earlier with Mage Hand, and found that at the very least, they could be disabled via physical force created via magic.

So I spent a casting of Wish on Mage Hand. Well, more accurately I spent it on dozens of Mage Hands, one for each remaining seal.

The world began spinning wildly. We were thrown about the room, while books, scrolls, and ancient broken technology of divine make bounced around with us.

Then it stopped. We got up. We were in a white void, An elderly gnome, or what looked like an elderly gnome, smiled approvingly at us from her chair.

I wasnt expecting you to actually succeed.

We were a little bit stunned, but we began asking questions, mostly about mysteries we'd encountered in the campaign setting. She answered all of them, and assured us that she'd wiped the memories of the elven demigods, so we wouldn't need to fear their reprisal. She then proceeded to ask me what had driven me to free her. I told her that I simply loved knowledge.

Naturally, she approved of my answer immensely, and decided on a suitable reward.

A stone doorway appeared near us. It cracked open, and black shadowy tentacles began reaching out.

Crap. I'd seen enough spoilers for FMA to know that this was probably bad.

Upon being dragged though, I was exposed to all knowledge in existence. I became omniscient.

I then awoke on a hilltop, not too far from the village we'd been staying in, my mind spinning from having briefly contained infinitely more information than it was equipped to handle. I'd forgotten everything I saw behind the stone door. More than that, even. I checked my spellbook. All but a few pages were now blank.

I'd asked my DM if I could continue playing this character in the next campaign, so I wasn't upset at having been knocked back down to an appropriate level.",2018-06-15 01:29:25

2232,"Nah. It has the illusion of being better at those things by having a super diverse cast but still sidelining the minorities and lgbtq characters. Looking at the one character in the core four who is a minority, Veronica Lodge (people might argue that KJ Apa is half Samoan, and that's fine and I'm glad he's proud of his heritage, but it's pretty safe to say that Archie Andrews is white and is perceived as white and is white in society), and seeing how Veronica is treated compared to the other three not only in writing but also by a large portion of the fandom who sweeps all of Bughead's wrongdoings under the carpet and insists that Ronnie is an evil bitch from Hell at every turn conceivable, I think it has just as much to do with the fanbase as the writing. These shows at least in the states are watched largely by heterosexual white girls who subconsciously gravitate towards ""their"" things. Most shows tend to know their demographic and intend to appease them. It's hard to tell these fans that they have racial and other biases because they truly do not recognize it and are not being deliberately or maliciously prejudiced, and when you use the R word around them (racist) they will just get super defensive about it, sitting there in their Hannah Montana PJs while listening to Taylor Swift and identifying heavily with Betty Cooper, beyond triggered that you would even \*\*imply\*\* that their brain is conditioned to seek out and stan the whitest things in everything. Think about how almost every relationship of significance on this program involves people of color and/or lgbtq characters, and how Betty/Jughead are pretty much the one true blue white heterosexual romantic pairing, and how much more popular they are than everything else on the show. I don't think that's entirely a coincidence, at all. It's because Bughead makes Becky and Karen's ovaries flutter like nothing else, and the writers and showrunners know it.

2237,"You should pursue this further. What country do you live in? There are A LOT of things the ECG should be able to tell a doctor, and it seems very weird that they only commented on the heart attack issue. A good doctor will show you the readouts from the ECG, explain what's normal, show you specifically ON THE PAPER what isn't normal, why it's not normal, what it's called, etc etc etc. 

If you're going to a doctor that doesn't explain things, get a new one. Period. 

Go to a general practitioner, let them know you've been having painful, irregular heartbeats and you would like a referral to see a specialist--even if just to put your mind at ease. A general practitioner should be able to get you in to see a cardiologist. 

To rule out other possible issues: 

\- How are your electrolytes? Simply drinking water may not be enough. Remember: salt, magnesium and potassium are the most important electrolytes and are key to hydration. You can get these in powdered form online or at a health store and add them to a drink a couple times a day to ensure you are properly balanced out; it DOES make a difference. Fatigue, heart palpitations, lethargy, mental fogginess, and irritability can all be helped by supplementing electrolytes. Most of us are not adequately hydrated. 

\- Are you sure this isn't an anxiety issue? (The pain makes me think no) 

\- How is your diet and lifestyle? How is your weight? 

A simple blood test can flag or eliminate some base-level concerns before you go all-out at the cardiologist for a full workup. It makes sense to step things up incrementally.

Point of clarification;  you're not wrong, you're just not labeling this particular aspect of a turbo system.

Wastegates or variable nozzle turbines control boost by altering the turbine wheel speed.  The flutter isn't related to the wastegate directly, but the absence of a compressor bypass function, aka ""blowoff valve"" which is not found on stock diesel systems... possibly because they don't usually have a throttle plate.  Even without a throttle plate on a diesel, though, as you pointed out the flutter can still take place because manifold pressure is high, air volume is up, but suddenly has nowhere to go.  The fluttering is supersonic air bouncing between the engine and the turbo compressor.  This can be bad in extreme cases and can cause severe damage to a turbocharger... up to and including broken wheel or snapped turbo shaft.",2018-06-15 05:38:00

I never saw a cardiologist. I just went straight from my GP to a center where they gave me the monitor and explained how to use it. I never saw any printouts or results. I do need a new doctor. Mine is a nincompoop. 

I think it's very possible that I'm not hydrated enough because I don't drink enough water. But I don't drink anything else either. I'm not a soda person. I'm either drinking water or herbal tea, or very occasionally a decaf coffee. I am on a huge daily multi-vitamin but I don't know if that would help with electrolytes.

I think when I'm having these heart problems, then I start to get anxious about it, and that doesn't help.

Well your heart is a muscle, and it works even when you're sleeping lol. 

Anxiety and trauma can surface in various ways. You could get panic attacks without any obvious trigger. My aunt thought she was having a heart attack once, went to the ER....turns out she was just having a MASSIVE, MASSIVE panic attack because she had been sexually abused her whole life by her dad....which she also suppressed and never even realized even though it went on into her adult life. Seriously. She had no idea. She had NO IDEA why she was having a ""heart attack"" in the middle of the night. 

I'm not saying you're suppressing years of sexual abuse (lol) but that the body can process trauma in strange ways. Only you know your history and mental health, but it is worth considering if just for a moment. 

Is the pain and fluttering associated with exercise at all? 

IF you're deficient in electrolytes simply drinking water may not be enough. I would highly recommend buying them in powdered form and mixing them into a drink a couple times a day. Its a low-cost solution with almost immediate benefits. Win-win.

For whatever reason, my lil parakeet Greenie (he's green) will flutter around like crazy in the cage when I slowly reach in to get the water and food bowls.  But if he escapes, he'll always land on the floor and immediately hop onto my finger, every single time without fail, the first time.  However, if he sees the cage, he'll panic fly away and usually end up on the ground again, whereupon it's like a 50 50 on whether he gets up on me or flies away.

Thus, any patho-anatomy or condition causing dysfunction of the nervous system can lead to a variety of effects on the muscles down there.

Some things to check/include:

- Value of dart.sdkPath and dart.flutterSdkPath in both User Settings and Workspace Settings
- Any errors or warnings in the dev console (Help -> Toggle Developer Tools)
- The specific message/failure that you see

And if the message is the ""Can't find SDK"" with a [Locate SDK] button, does using Locate and navigating to it solve the issue? (You need to navigate to the correct SDK type here too, either Flutter or Dart, but I think we validate that).

Also - if you've updated Flutter recently (or changed channel), try running `flutter doctor` or similar from the command-line first, as the Dart SDK is only downloaded on the first run (this should be handled better in v2.14.0, but worth testing).

He glanced up at the bundles again, lips pressed into a thin line. They have more prisoners in these things, he said lowly.

Next to them, the man stirred weakly. His eyes fluttered open - and widened at the sight of a handful of Space Marines hovering over him. He pushed himself up on his elbows with some effort and took his surroundings in with bewilderment and fear. He sputtered and coughed before finally managing a few words. Mlords, he stuttered, eyes darting from one to the next. Thank you. I thought I was gonna die in there. Tears of relief stood in his eyes even as he cringed away fearfully from Xariks massive armour.

2273,"Haggard  was a fat giant of a man. He towered over his students at nine 9feet tall. Hermione watched in awe as he guided his students  into the magical creature pen just outside his wooden hut. 
""Right, ladies! T'day we're gunna lern aboot Brarhead Hoonds! Tern to page 69 of yer textbooks!"" 
There was a flutter of paper  as students opened their books.  A Japanese girl to Hermione's right raised her hand. 
""P-Professor? Do you mean, Braehead Hounds?"" 
""Aye, chinky,"" Haggard replied, ""Thas what I said - Brarhead Hoonds.""
There was a pause  as Haggard opened the gate. Two excited Braehead Hounds leapt and barked.
""Ahh need two 2volunteers!"" Haggard boomed. 
He scratched his beard and looked at the class before suddenly pointing at Hermione. 
""Whoremione! You'll do! And I need one more... Oy! Slanty eyes! You're up as well! Get in the pen!"" 
Hermione and the Japanese  girl stood up and stepped into the Braehead Hounds'  pen.
""Now, girls. These are magical creechurs. Yeh have to be be very careful because these are horny dogs! I'm gunna teach yeh how to handle them safely!""
Haggard then closed the gate and locked it shut. 
Ring ring   
""Aww shit, that's mah phone.  I'll be back faster than Congress  can impeach Trump.""   
Haggard wandered off, leaving the girls locked inside the wooden fence with the Hounds while the class watched.  Suddenly the Braehead Hounds  began to walk towards the girls!
""G-good d-doggy..."" the Japanese  girl whimpered, stepping back and raising open palms.  
Suddenly, one of the Hounds  leapt at her, knocking her onto her back. She landed on the ground, her schoolgirl skirt lifting up to reveal her panties. Hermione watched as the Japanese  girl's arms sank into the muddy earth.  She struggled to stand back up - but her arms were completely stuck! 
The Braehead Hound  wasted no time ploughing its snout  between her yellow thighs. It's sharp teeth quickly found her cotton panties and chewed them off, exposing her virgin pussy to the entire class!
""N-Noooo!"" she screamed.
Hermione panicked as the second Hound turned to face her. In a frantic flurry she made a dash  for the wooden fence. There was a small crack between the planks - maybe enough for Hermione to squeeze through. She could hear the Hound chasing her!
""Ah! Dammit!"" Hermione cried.
She had tried to dive through the gap, but she had only managed to get her upper half through the hole. She was stuck waist down in the pen. No matter how she struggled and wriggled, the little witch couldn't break free.
She frantically searched for her wand,  grabbing it from her cloak's pocket. As she lifted the magical stick to cast a spell it was snatched from her hand! 
""Sorry, does this belong to you, Whoremione?"" Muffloy jeered.
The Slither-in student had stolen her only defence against the Hound.
""Give that back!"" Hermione yelled.
""No, I think the class would rather watch what happens next, you filthy mudblood."" 
The Japanese  girl's arms were still stuck in the thick muddy soil. The Braehead Hound  had buried its head between her thighs now. Its long, wet  tongue  was repeatedly caressing her virgin slit, lapping up her teenage juices. 
""Ah! Ah! Ahhh! St-stooohhhhp! Ayaaaaahhhhhh!""
The Hound slurped and slobbered    at her cunt, its hot tongue  driving her  with unwanted pleasure. Her little clitoris  was burning with each graze of the beast's  talented muscle. 
""Oh!!! Ohhhhh! I'm cuuummmmmiing!"" she screamed, her body convulsing. 
She shook and thrashed near-uncontrollably. The unwanted orgasm rocked her body to its core. But the Hound  wasn't finished yet - it continued licking  even after she had finished.
""W-Wait! Ahhh! T-too sensitive!!!! Ooooohhhh! Ahhhhhhhh!!!""
Hermione was not having much luck  either. The second Hound had placed its paws upon her back in an attempt to mount her. It's hard, eight 8inch shaft was already pressing up against her tight vulva  through her panties. It thrust forward as hard as it could, but the elastic panties refused to yield. 
""Oh! Ah! Bad dog! Ah!"" Hermione gasped.
She struggled to break free and keep her composure in front of her class. If she could only last until Haggard came back...
rrrrriiiipppp
""AHHHHHHH!""
Hermione's panties suddenly snapped and eight inches of doggy dick plunged into her soaking wet pussy.  
She felt it fill up her body, stretching her cunt with its thick cock. Almost immediately it began to thrust in and out at an inhumanly quick pace. 
""Ah! Ah! Ah!"" 
Her moans came fast. Too fast. She could barely catch her breath.  She curled her toes  as the pleasure spread like a plague  throughout her body. With each thrust her big breasts   swung back and forth.
She clenched her hands  and banged her fists  against the fence. Her efforts were fruitless though - she was well and truly stuck.
The Japanese  student had cum four 4times now. Her little mind was going blank as the hound's  unceasing tongue  never stopped licking.
""Aaaahhh! Oh yes!! Yesss!!! I'm a little doggy slut!!! Lick  my pussy  !"" she hollered, another orgasm washing through her body.
Hermione felt something thick begin to swell within her pussy. 
""Oh look,"" Muffloy laughed, ""it's knotting Whoremione!""
The swelling pushed up and stretched her pussy, placing an immense pressure upon her quivering g-spot. This was enough to drive  her over the edge.
""Oh! Oh fuck! I'm cummming! Nooooooohhhhhhh!!!""
Hermione's body betrayed her as she came. Seconds later she heard the Hound howl.
""Arroooooo!""
""No! Don't cum inside me!""
Hermione knew that many of the magical creatures in Haggard's class could impregnate girls. Right now was a very dangerous time of the month for her!
She felt a hot, goopy fluid rush into the depths of her pussy  and flood into her fertile womb. The sensation was enough to send a second orgasm through her teenage body. Already, the Hound's sperm were swimming towards her teenage eggs , seeking to fertilise them. As the Braehead Hound  continued to cum, the cum began to leak  out of her pussy  and trickle down her thighs.
""Hahaha!"" the class roared in laughter at the two girls' plight. 
""Looks like Whoremione is going to be a pregnant slut now!"" Muffloy jeered, egging the crowd on.
""N-noooooo! Get me out of the fence! I- ahhh- I need to get the cum out! Ooooh!""
After five minutes of pumping her pussy  full of cum,  the Hound finally released her, leaving her lower half drenched in thick white semen.  The Japanese  girl wasn't faring any better. The Hound  had finally left her alone - but she was still quivering on the ground in the aftershock of twelve 12consecutive orgasms.
Haggard returned four hours later - long enough for the Hounds to fuck the Japanese  girl, and for Hermione's tight little ass  to get flooded with doggy cum too.

""Oh bugger,"" mumbled Haggard, ""I've already hit mah allowed limit of eight impregnated students this month. The school nurse is gunna kill  me...""",2018-06-15 11:14:34

Get rid of the egg cartons completely. It's not that they do nothing at all, but they don't do what you need. Also, they are flammable.

Never cover the entire surface with acoustic panels. That would result in an uncomfortably dead room. Using the Sabine equation you can get a very very rough idea of how much surface area you need to treat. I'd say it'll be around 10m to 20m. That would get you to reverberation times of roughly 1s to 0.5s. 

I'd start with 10m and see if you like the result. Distribute the panels across the walls at an average high. You don't need to treat the upper and lower part of the walls necessarily. Ideally, you also hang some panels on the ceiling.

That'll take care of the excessive reverberation. The other problem will be flutter echo. That's what happens if you have two parallel walls opposite of each other. Sound will reflect back and forth rapidly, resulting in a metallic ringing and flutter. You deal with this by treating at least one of the walls. So if you distribute the panels, make sure you alternate between the walls. 

Don't buy thin acoustic foam. A lot of foam products are way too thin to absorb anything but high frequencies. That would leave you with a muddy mess, because all the low mid frequencies would still reverberate and make critical listening very hard. Pyramid and other surface features are completely unimportant and jsut marketing features (at least with most foam products). 

Instead use panels that are made from mineral wool. These will typically be wrapped in cloth and are aesthetically pleasing. Go for at least 2"" thickness, better more. Buying them is a little more expensive than buying foam, but the result is way more usable.

If you have the budget, getting bass traps is a very valuable investment. Something like a [tubetrap](http://www.tubetrap.com) or any other absorber of that type can be stacked in room corners and it'll clear up the bass area. In rehearsal rooms that means everyone will be able to hear the bass more defined, which is a huge deal in my opinion, since timing and intonation greatly depend on that.",2018-06-15 11:17:14

I have been looking closely at using flutter and dart. I'm not an expert on comparing the architectures, but it appears to have already solved the challenges that React Native is just starting to address with their re-architecture?

En base a lo que coments en el ttulo, seguridad informtica es distinto a lo que es infraestructura que es distinto a lo que es desarrollo.

Con respecto a webFrontend hoy lo que se pide mucho es ReactJS y Angular; finalmente en backend lo que suelo ver es bastante Node y en menor medida .Net y Java.

De todas maneras esta es MI visin que puede ser muy distinta a otras personas en otros crculos, el mundo de sistemas es muy amplio (como vos bien mencions) y lo que yo te cuento es solamente una cara.

Poor girl's in for a rough ride with my nutjob boys for the Summer. In the Fall, the older boy will be 4 and will go to pre-school on the same bus as his soon-to-be 2nd grade sister. Capitol Hill and Rondo are in the same building so they'll ride the same bus. Good times.

We'll figure out to what day care-y thing we'll send the 2-year old in the Fall. It'll be nice to only pay for child care for one kid (other than already paying taxes for public schools, but that's another issue).

2297,"Haggard  was a fat giant of a man. He towered over his students at nine 9feet tall. Hermione watched in awe as he guided his students  into the magical creature pen just outside his wooden hut. 
""Right, ladies! T'day we're gunna lern aboot Brarhead Hoonds! Tern to page 69 of yer textbooks!"" 
There was a flutter of paper  as students opened their books.  A Japanese girl to Hermione's right raised her hand. 
""P-Professor? Do you mean, Braehead Hounds?"" 
""Aye, chinky,"" Haggard replied, ""Thas what I said - Brarhead Hoonds.""
There was a pause  as Haggard opened the gate. Two excited Braehead Hounds leapt and barked.
""Ahh need two 2volunteers!"" Haggard boomed. 
He scratched his beard and looked at the class before suddenly pointing at Hermione. 
""Whoremione! You'll do! And I need one more... Oy! Slanty eyes! You're up as well! Get in the pen!"" 
Hermione and the Japanese  girl stood up and stepped into the Braehead Hounds'  pen.
""Now, girls. These are magical creechurs. Yeh have to be be very careful because these are horny dogs! I'm gunna teach yeh how to handle them safely!""
Haggard then closed the gate and locked it shut. 
Ring ring  
""Aww shit, that's mah phone.  I'll be back faster than Congress  can impeach Trump.""   
Haggard wandered off, leaving the girls locked inside the wooden fence with the Hounds while the class watched.  Suddenly the Braehead Hounds  began to walk towards the girls!
""G-good d-doggy..."" the Japanese  girl whimpered, stepping back and raising open palms.  
Suddenly, one of the Hounds  leapt at her, knocking her onto her back. She landed on the ground, her schoolgirl skirt lifting up to reveal her panties. Hermione watched as the Japanese  girl's arms sank into the muddy earth.  She struggled to stand back up - but her arms were completely stuck! 
The Braehead Hound  wasted no time ploughing its snout  between her yellow thighs. It's sharp teeth quickly found her cotton panties and chewed them off, exposing her virgin pussy to the entire class!
""N-Noooo!"" she screamed.
Hermione panicked as the second Hound turned to face her. In a frantic flurry she made a dash  for the wooden fence. There was a small crack between the planks - maybe enough for Hermione to squeeze through. She could hear the Hound chasing her!
""Ah! Dammit!"" Hermione cried.
She had tried to dive through the gap, but she had only managed to get her upper half through the hole. She was stuck waist down in the pen. No matter how she struggled and wriggled, the little witch couldn't break free.
She frantically searched for her wand,  grabbing it from her cloak's pocket. As she lifted the magical stick to cast a spell it was snatched from her hand! 
""Sorry, does this belong to you, Whoremione?"" Muffloy jeered.
The Slither-in student had stolen her only defence against the Hound.
""Give that back!"" Hermione yelled.
""No, I think the class would rather watch what happens next, you filthy mudblood."" 
The Japanese  girl's arms were still stuck in the thick muddy soil. The Braehead Hound  had buried its head between her thighs now. Its long, wet  tongue  was repeatedly caressing her virgin slit, lapping up her teenage juices. 
""Ah! Ah! Ahhh! St-stooohhhhp! Ayaaaaahhhhhh!""
The Hound slurped and slobbered    at her cunt, its hot tongue  driving her  with unwanted pleasure. Her little clitoris  was burning with each graze of the beast's  talented muscle. 
""Oh!!! Ohhhhh! I'm cuuummmmmiing!"" she screamed, her body convulsing. 
She shook and thrashed near-uncontrollably. The unwanted orgasm rocked her body to its core. But the Hound  wasn't finished yet - it continued licking  even after she had finished.
""W-Wait! Ahhh! T-too sensitive!!!! Ooooohhhh! Ahhhhhhhh!!!""
Hermione was not having much luck  either. The second Hound had placed its paws upon her back in an attempt to mount her. It's hard, eight 8inch shaft was already pressing up against her tight vulva  through her panties. It thrust forward as hard as it could, but the elastic panties refused to yield. 
""Oh! Ah! Bad dog! Ah!"" Hermione gasped.
She struggled to break free and keep her composure in front of her class. If she could only last until Haggard came back...
rrrrriiiipppp
""AHHHHHHH!""
Hermione's panties suddenly snapped and eight inches of doggy dick plunged into her soaking wet pussy.  
She felt it fill up her body, stretching her cunt with its thick cock. Almost immediately it began to thrust in and out at an inhumanly quick pace. 
""Ah! Ah! Ah!"" 
Her moans came fast. Too fast. She could barely catch her breath.  She curled her toes  as the pleasure spread like a plague  throughout her body. With each thrust her big breasts   swung back and forth.
She clenched her hands  and banged her fists  against the fence. Her efforts were fruitless though - she was well and truly stuck.
The Japanese  student had cum four 4times now. Her little mind was going blank as the hound's  unceasing tongue  never stopped licking.
""Aaaahhh! Oh yes!! Yesss!!! I'm a little doggy slut!!! Lick  my pussy  !"" she hollered, another orgasm washing through her body.
Hermione felt something thick begin to swell within her pussy. 
""Oh look,"" Muffloy laughed, ""it's knotting Whoremione!""
The swelling pushed up and stretched her pussy, placing an immense pressure upon her quivering g-spot. This was enough to drive  her over the edge.
""Oh! Oh fuck! I'm cummming! Nooooooohhhhhhh!!!""
Hermione's body betrayed her as she came. Seconds later she heard the Hound howl.
""Arroooooo!""
""No! Don't cum inside me!""
Hermione knew that many of the magical creatures in Haggard's class could impregnate girls. Right now was a very dangerous time of the month for her!
She felt a hot, goopy fluid rush into the depths of her pussy  and flood into her fertile womb. The sensation was enough to send a second orgasm through her teenage body. Already, the Hound's sperm were swimming towards her teenage eggs , seeking to fertilise them. As the Braehead Hound  continued to cum, the cum began to leak  out of her pussy  and trickle down her thighs.
""Hahaha!"" the class roared in laughter at the two girls' plight. 
""Looks like Whoremione is going to be a pregnant slut now!"" Muffloy jeered, egging the crowd on.
""N-noooooo! Get me out of the fence! I- ahhh- I need to get the cum out! Ooooh!""
After five minutes of pumping her pussy  full of cum,  the Hound finally released her, leaving her lower half drenched in thick white semen.  The Japanese  girl wasn't faring any better. The Hound  had finally left her alone - but she was still quivering on the ground in the aftershock of twelve 12consecutive orgasms.
Haggard returned four hours later - long enough for the Hounds to fuck the Japanese  girl, and for Hermione's tight little ass  to get flooded with doggy cum too.

""Oh bugger,"" mumbled Haggard, ""I've already hit mah allowed limit of eight impregnated students this month. The school nurse is gunna kill  me...""

2298,"When I was in fifth grade, I went through a phase where I loved paper airplanes. I constantly experimented with different styles, wing angles, and wing sizes in an endless quest for improved performance. Our back porch was above the back yard which sloped down and away from the house, making it the perfect launching point for paper airplanes. I had worked on one that was getting very good distance when, as I launched it from the porch, was lifted by a breeze into a nearby pine tree. The tree was close and the plane was firmly lodged only six or seven feet away from the porch. I turned to my mother for help in getting it down.

She came out on the porch and looked at the plane. She said, ""Wait here, I'll get it down,"" and went back into the house. She returned with a 20 gauge shotgun. I asked, ""Are you going to reach out and knock it down?"" She didn't say a word as she raised the gun and blew my plane out of the tree. I stood in shock watching bits of paper flutter to the ground and my mother went back into the house.

She did get the plane out of the tree.",2018-06-15 16:00:40

2300,"Ironically, the problem occurs because the planes going over improve reception for a time. Normally most of the signal is blocked be obstructions on the ground. The signals reflect off the plane down to your antenna. Unfortunately, part of the time the direct signal and the reflected signal will be about the same strength and since the plane is moving they will go in and out of phase and be cancelled some of the time. The effect is called ""airplane flutter"" because that is what used to happen to the picture/sound in the analog days.

The solution to airplane flutter is a higher gain antenna put up high enough off the ground to be above most of the obstructions. That normally means a roof antenna unless you can make an attic antenna work.",2018-06-15 16:11:11

He thinks we have to find ways to remedy this.

I think 2 guys in a garage can still do it on their own.  You just have to pick the right tech and leverage it: for example, maybe serverless or rails/elixir on the back-end, and flutter on the front-end for ios and android combined, and then clojurescript (with its rapid dev cycles) for a javascript front-end combined with graphql (because REST is an enormous waste of time).

If you bridge, make sure its a done deal in that attempt. Don't half ass bridge 5x trying to escape cause that just wastes energy.

And also well its not really a Prince problem. The boomers appear to en masse kind of been ok with sexualizing young people. Its something they received from the gift of the 60s, this great revelation and release of all these pent up frustrations, this great liberation of our culture that appears to have occurred. 

Prince couldnt have done this if he didnt have a strong foundation to start from. 

The language of love songs in this period might be a good place to start. Hell, [even Buddy Holly] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyTtFNGzFsE) can give off a creepy vibe if you listen to his lyrics. [Bob Dylan] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1CwAhcMxiE) wasnt always on the right side of the fence either, but at least with him and [Bobby Vee] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PD6PYTpcvWE) you get this kind of sense that theres a little bit of a pathetic side to this craving. [Theyre being childish about their love] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D7QMAJOGeA) yes, but self-consciously so, because love is in some ways a bit of a childish feeling. 

[David Bowie] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbIdiaPtkTM) came to understand this. He refused to do a scene with a 15 year old Jennifer Connolly that involved a kiss when he acted as Jareth the Goblin King in an allegory about child rape. This does not excuse him. But it does demonstrate that he indeed did come to realize he had done something evil. 

But honestly, all of this is a product of a very sick undercurrent in our culture that is probably still there and that we cant really do anything about. All we can do is be mindful of it, know when we see it, and bring attention to this terrible cycle of abuse by the old upon the young. 

This line of dialogue is very similar to how I interpreted [Saturnz Barz] (https://www.reddit.com/r/gorillaz/comments/61sn5v/its_about_drugs_obviously_saturnz_barz/), and indeed, some of these themes recur in Gorillaz music. Theres [Mix 2] which is a Michael Jackson parody about the Westminster Pedophile Scandal. And theres also [Halfway to the Halfway House] (https://www.reddit.com/r/gorillaz/comments/7ffr08/its_about_drugs_obviously_halfway_to_the_halfway/), which shares similarities in the bass filter with this song, about the murder of [Sam Cooke] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dl5usKhGz60). 

And so this song isnt just about one child murder, or the abuse of one child. Its not just about Gary Glitter or Jimmy Savile and others who used their power and celebrity to hide their perverse criminal activities, or Michael Jackson (allegedly). Its about how the old generation uses celebrity to conceal the evil of their heroes. Heroes who are not heroes sometimes. Heroes who are actually violent psychopaths, and deranged criminals.

I will now discuss Hercules, Disneys 1997 film which this song is kind of carrying thematically. Hercules follows [Hercules,] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YyRZwdgHN_A) a baby who is irreparably separated from his parents when his uncle Hades tries to kill him to avoid a prophecy. Hades, [voiced by James Woods,] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPjo-7m4DV4) another recipient of sexual abuse allegations, is based on the behavior of a Hollywood agent. 

Anyway, Hades has in his captivity a beautiful young woman named [Meg] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rO1IIlCDCEs ), voiced by Susan Egan, somewhat based on [Dana Delaneys] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeYZDFkKFlM) performance as Lois Lane on Superman. Meg is 18 years old, apparently (most of the Disney Princesses are actually very young). She sold [her soul to Hades] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7csy_QxPVo) to save the life of an unfaithful boyfriend when she was a child.

Meg is perhaps the wittiest and most sardonic of all the Disney Princesses of this era (people say she is not a princess, but, in fact, she is technically after she marries Hercules at the end, as Hercules is technically a prince). Susans performance of Meg [is winsome in an honest, heartfelt way] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl0DMTlwLw4), that really touched me at the time. Which makes the fact that she is essentially a [kidnap victim and hostage] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkIgGFcv_Vc) all that much worse. 

The lyrics to Hercules were written mostly by David Zippel, and frankly, Zippels lyrics are not great. Now, [Hercules is a mortal who was meant to be a god,] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgnHF2CwrPs) and so there is a certain appropriateness to his [quest to find himself] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm-asTkWk9s), following that little voice in his head. But especially with [Go the Distance] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0bhhMOlfl4) theres a kind of schizophrenic undercurrent that would be unhealthy for a child to mimic (yes, they got Michael Bolton and Ricky Martin to sing the song).


But its not so bad, I guess. Danny DeVito, the trainer of heroes Philoctetes, isnt really an abusive figure, per se. He does try to keep a lid on Hercs ego. He does try to warn him that Meg is ultimately using him. 

And ultimately, he does prepare Herc to be capable of [great personal sacrifice] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wKNbhcK5NA), proving himself worthy of his birthright and earning his godhood in as heroic a way as one could hope. 

But that doesnt change the fact that this film is basically about abused, kidnapped children fighting their way through a game of their older generations making, forced to make sacrifices, fight their monsters and prevail against what are essentially impossible odds. And it does have a happy and fitting ending. 

Except according to mythology, Herc is afflicted by madness from Hera, herself acting in a jealous rage over Zeuss infidelity, and ends up killing Meg and their children years in the future. Heras Hercs mother in the Disney film though, so Im sure it worked out fine there, maybe, hopefully. 

The film itself is a bit of a mess, as Disney shortened the script to keep the running time to 90 minutes. But the music is pretty good. [Very gospel] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rrq9VqpaFpU) inflected though.  

/u/Char10tti3 recently wrote that the first line, [my face will be painted in these white brick lines] (https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/grenfell-tower-fire-mural-painted-over-ladbroke-grove-outrage-a7921231.html) might be a send up to the graffiti on Grenfel Tower after the 2017 fire that killed 72 people, including 18 children. I think its a good thought. A brutal analogy to the plague of children being murdered: forcing them to live in cheap public housing, shoddily constructed to the point of catastrophe. The older generation suffocating the younger one through their extreme arrogance and idiotic planning. 

I am not so upset as I was when I started writing this, so I will let you know what I think the lyrics are. 

Having nearly choked to unconsciousness once (my fault, too big morsel. Cmon I was sixteen) I can tell you that what happens is you get tunnel vision and everything starts floating. So if somebody is choking you, their face will start waving and getting smaller. My buddy Minotaur from [House Party in Brooklyn] (https://www.reddit.com/r/gorillaz/comments/7s0kne/its_about_drugs_obviously_a_house_party_in/) was there, and he started slapping my face, thinking I was putting on an act or something. 

The crazies put on buses and sent to find the listener are police, and rescuers. 2D, like a psychopath reminds his victim that if she (or he) dies, the police will kill him, in a scary f*cking creeper voice. 

Chasing fireflies is a real macabre image for the kind of child abuse were talking about. Its just to scary little picture of 2D mentally following these little gleams of light into the dark, evil abyss. A game, like hunting, that is apparently the fault of the victim. And when he catches them, puts them in a little jar to watch them slowly stop lighting up due to lack of air, it does get him the kind of summit, the kind of climax he wanted at all. It just reminds him of how many have died, and will die, sacrificed to this dark, malevolent impulse found within the human condition. 

Im love drunk Im sorry am I losing you, he says, as his victim suffocates. 

The end of the song kind of suggests he lets the firefly go, as it flutters off into the night. But what effect will this trauma have? 

We can only prey the victim will not return to enact their revenge on another poor young soul, abusing and twisting their image to suit their own inner vision, to repeat this cycle once again. 

Fire Flies (hmm the destructive energy touches so many people in myriad ways) is one of the more mindfucking of any Gorillaz tune. Its heavy, and sad, and gruesome and creepy and morbid and scary. But its a great composition. Thank you, Gorillaz.

But I kinda wish youd just done that Owl City cover.

2339,"He wiped the sweat from his forehead. In a moment it would be wet again. The hours had been long, and his body ached. It was still worth it. All of his pain and fatigue was a whisper against the roar of triumph from the finished piece now glowing in the atrium's light. A tiny imperfection, a spontaneous flourish, had been his final stroke. He had removed a fleck of ivory from the cheek and made a little pock mark. It could barely be seen, but it lent the face character and humanity. This was Pygmalion's finest work yet, and he was in awe of his own talent. It was hard to believe the form before him was mere ivory, that the delicate flesh did not give to the touch, the abdomen did not pulse with breath, the slender legs did not shift with impatience, those eyes did not look at him with the longing of a living soul. Perhaps it was the lack of sleep, or the intense heat, or the prologue to dementia, but he was drawn forward to his masterpiece. Embraced it as a lover. With a slow gentleness he kissed its cold lips.

He bounded backward and shook his head. What he needed was a hot bath and rest. It was still a beautiful sight to behold. In another moment of whimsy, he spoke a silent prayer to the goddess of love and wished his creation to be made truly alive. He laughed at his own eccentricity and started to make his way to the bath. But then the light from the atrium seared his vision with a flash, and the masterpiece glowed as though ascending to Heaven. With one hand shielding his eyes from the worst of it, he watched as the ivory skin of his creation was enlivened. The eyes fluttered. The shoulders shifted. The goddess was answering his prayer.

And then she toppled over. Those slender legs were too thin to support her weight as it squirmed with new life. Her ankle broke, and she broke into dozens of pieces when she crashed into the floor. Pygmalion ran to his creation too late to save it and fell to his knees, weeping and wailing. He pulled the fragments together as though they would melt back into place, but he was only in time to watch as the last of her life escaped and ascended the sun's rays back to the goddess who sent her.",2018-06-15 21:58:49

2344,">Are you are romantically interested in people: like want to flirt, get fluttery emotions, or want to make people like you back? 

Romantic Interest? Yes. Short answer: No, yes (fluttery emotions) and no.

**Will try to clarify point-by-point.**

(My definition of romantic interest) **I wouldn't mind companionship and meaningful conversation**, but I do refuse to partake in the pageantry of getting another person to like me ever again.

**I do not like/agree with society's version of romance.**

**Don't care for flirting** \- All it is, is appealing to a person's pride about their appearance/personal attributes. What people call ""flattery"". I'm old enough to realize that there plenty of ""lines"" and I've been the sender/receiver of some of them. It's fun until you realize how fake it is. 

**Fluttery feelings** \- If I express interest in a person and that person reciprocates, it's a nice feeling.

**Make people want to like me?** \- I used to be like this and I'd internalize rejection and take it personally. My self-esteem suffered alot.

I no longer feel ""bad"" about myself if I get rejected. If a person doesn't want to date me, it's their decision and I will leave. 

>Maybe you get a ""crush"" on someone because of something about them(their presence, personality, humor, non-sexual attributes)? 

Usually, I find the person attractive and their personality/humor either magnifies it or reduces it. 

When it comes to consumating anything I'm very indifferent. It just feels like...laying in a bed (with another person). My former partner would like it but in my mind I was like ""that's it?"" (about the whole thing)

Something clicks.

There's an immediate and sharp pain in your hand. You feel like you've been branded, then stabbed. You try to pull free to no avail, the wall has tightened on your arm. You try to scream, and can't summon the breath.

Only for a second, you are blind. Only the throbbing pain in your hand lets you know where you are.

Then it's over. The wall spits out your hand, which you cradle protectively, and you open your eyes.

The first thing you notice is how well-lit the Foundry has become. You can now make out the distinct shapes of machinery and objects that you know by name, even if you're certain you've never seen them before.

The second is that your vision is different, somehow. There's a kind of crystalline, grainy effect to it now. More than that, icons and symbols flutter everywhere you look. There's one across the door (which you just *know* will open and lock at your command, should you wish), several on the shelves, and-

2364,"Suddenly, shoving aside a bushy palm, I spied a treasure. Not in any text or on any map, it is a lost, uncharted, and intimidating sight. 

There, in a clearing surrounded by trees that separated us from the parkgoers just a few hundred yards away, was a woman. She lay facedown on a garish towel, legs splayed wantonly. Her delightful caramel skin drinks in the sun, and I found myself envious of the way it gets to caress her all at once. 

Her hips moved and twitched with an unmistakable motion, and my eyes were drawn, then riveted, to the source. Her black suit bottom was pulled to the side, and her fingers teased herself mercilessly. When they hit her clit, she jumped. When they rubbed her lips, her hips ground in appreciation, and in between, I caught glimpses of her hidden pink skin a secret so intimate the tips of my ears blaze at seeing it with her unaware.

Decisions. 

I would never have this opportunity again. I could not invent this moment except late at night when my only companions are my lust and imagination. Did I dare take advantage of something truly once-in-a-lifetime? 

It will end with a surprised woman rapidly covering up. It will end with fucking. It will end with my family and friends wondering where Ive gone to and seeing me handcuffed and taken away to jail and registering as a sex offender. But it could end with fucking. 

Its not worth it. Its not. The fantasy is one thing, but thats a live human woman over there in the sunlight, enjoying herself. She came to the same park I did. Shes clearly attractive enough to have found company if she wanted it. Women dont want to be surprised by strangers while theyre getting off, and they damn sure dont see a stranger and decide to fuck them.

So I turned around to leave in my mind.

In reality, while I was coming to this decision, she was raising her head and glancing around. When she saw me, she froze. So did I.
But she didnt cover up. Her sunglasses hid her expression, but her face may as well have been sculpted by a Greek master. Her lips were slightly parted, and it seemed to me it was more from lust than surprise. After a moment, she put her head back down and resumed rubbing herself with an obvious increase in pressure. 

It looked like I was going to jail after all.

As much as I wanted to simply watch her get herself off, I fucking wanted her. I wanted to mount her and claim her as my own with no pretense of civilized interaction. Her nonchalance wasnt an invitation for rape, though, so I had to find some other way to escalate things. 

My idiot caveman brain decided that way would be to walk around in front of her, drop my own swim trunks, and offer myself to her. Visions of the back seat of police cruisers ran through my head, but the sight of her playing had gotten me to a rare kind of hardness, and so I took myself in my hand, stroked gently, and stared at where I thought her eyes were behind her sunglasses. 

I hoped my message was obvious: *You did this. This is yours.* 

She watched me for long moments. I could see her delicious ass writhe as she worked herself over, but I refused to break eye contact. I wanted her to understand without speaking. Emboldened by her movements and her staring, I took a few shuffling steps towards her. Her face betrayed nothing.

I casually stepped out of my suit, and came right up to her. I could hear the slick sounds of her fingers on herself and catch the faint scent of her arousal. It was an intoxicant unequaled by manmade attempts. Her poker faceexpressionless except for her open mouth this whole timeno longer mattered. Her own hole had betrayed her. She was mine to take, and I knew it. 

I started to walk behind her, and she froze again. But this time, I did not. My idiot caveman brain was now screaming a cacophony inside my skull, demanding I take her as mine like we both wanted, but her hesitation told the story. This was a fantasy for her, too, and using her to get off might have been one part of it, but making sure she knew she was desired was another component. 

Watching me stroke myself as I watched her had offered that stimulation to hershe knew she was the reason. Fucking her like an animal wouldnt be the same. I knelt behind her, fully delirious from her now overpowering scent, and admired the sight before me. Her hand remained frozen, but her hips wiggled gently in anticipation. She was still unsure of my intentions.

In a swift motion, I made them known. I cupped her heavenly ass in my hands, spread her cheeks wide open and impaled her asshole with my tongue.

I could feel it tense in reaction to the suddenness of being penetrated, but she let out a low moan of pleasure and her fingers flicked across her clit at a furious pace. Her hole relaxed, and I didnt hesitate to work my tongue in deeper.

The more I tongue-fucked her, the more she took. I smashed my face against her, not caring how silly it seemed, and aware of her nectar collecting on my lower lip and chin. I was determined to make my intentions clear once again. I was not teasing her. I was not stopping. I was loving it as much as she was. 

I could feel her fingers blur across her clit as she realized I was getting her off first, and her breathing rapidly degenerated into a ragged mess. Her orgasm seemed to hit her like a wave, and suddenly she was grunting and bucking her hips as if to try and throw me off. I responded by grabbing her hips, forcing my tongue deeper, and refusing to stop.

I left my tongue inside her asshole as she slowly came down. When her breathing started to return to normal, I allowed her tight hole to push my tongue out. My chin was drenched, and all I could smell was her arousal. I had no intention of letting her recover too much, so I grabbed her legs to open them after they had closed, and spit directly on her pussy.

She was practically dripping, so there was no need to add lubrication, but the sound and sensation got a reaction like hitting her with a bolt of electricity. Her back arched, her head leaned back, and that was my moment to pounce. I adjusted myself between her legs, leaned forward, and sunk myself into her with a long, slow push.

She moaned. I moaned. Her heat was exquisite. I felt it consuming me and my higher brain functions began to flicker and dim. I was aware of the sensation of her muscles fluttering as they adjusted themselves to me as I filled her. I saw her hand shoot out and grasp the air in front of it. I saw a ring. 

Ah. Any intention to mercilessly pound her vanished. 

I ground against her slowly. I let her feel me as I moved in and out of her. I could feel the sweat building between our skin. I reached out to hold her left hand in mine, and I cupped her chin in my right.
Theyre all so close, I whispered in her ear. Right on the other side. They might see us if they ever thought to come this way.

She moaned.

But theyll never *know* who you really are, will they? They will want you, but they'll never know.

She made a blissful noise, and moved her hips against mine. We found a rhythm instantly, and soon she was grunting on every thrust while she played with her clit once again. The moment was upon us much too soon, and this time it was my breathing that went ragged first. I couldnt speak to warn her, but she knew from the way my body changed its movements, and soon she was right there with me. 

She clamped down hard on me, and it was like I was being electrocuted. I kept my groans as quiet as possible as my entire body tensed up, and all of my purpose flowed out of me and into her in heavy, violent spurts. I strove to drive myself as deeply inside her as possible to make our connection as intimate as possible. 

We laid together wordlessly for long, heaving breaths. I would have stayed impaled inside her for hours, but reality was out there right behind the tree line, and staying much longer ensured someone would come looking. With a final mutual groan, I slid out of her, and marveled at the sight of her sliding her suit back to keep my cum trapped deep inside her even longer. She adjusted herself and folded her ugly towel, and I knew I would be masturbating later at the idea that no one would ever know she was filled with my cum while they talked to her.

Wordlessly, she headed off, back to her life. I turned the opposite direction and prepared to resume mine, yet dreaming of the chance to find her in the clearing once again.

2368,"Victor and his companions strolled throughout the fairgrounds, stalking through the various stalls with vigilant eyes. Background chatter and machinery barraged his eardrums, shaking his concentration. They had been on the hunt for nearly four hours, yet *The New Dawn* still eluded their grasp. Perhaps it would be best to wait for another time. Excitement was high, and the commoners flocked to the venue like a moth to flame. After several days, the World Fair would slow down a little bit. He would still have to deal with ordinary folk, but at least there wouldn't be quite as many, or be quite as dull.

Snaking their way through the crowd, Victor's small group of nobles managed to find a place of relative quiet. A small forgotten corner, a few dusty chairs, and a worn table. A tad bit shabby, but it would have to make do. Carefully, the nobles inspected the area. Thankfully, they were safe. The Meniscate was known to favor lost places such as this, and one could never be too careful. Taking a seat, Victor was surprised to see how tired he had become from a mere few hours of walking around. His feet ached, and there seemed to be a strange buzz in the back of his brain. Sensory overload, most likely. But perhaps...

Frantically, Victor reached into his pocket. A small piece of deep red amber in his hand, the Radiant began to mutter incantations under his breath. Closing his eyes, the noble man suddenly fell silent. Moments later, his eyes fluttered open. The buzz was still there, if perhaps slightly lessened. Sheepishly, Victor put the amber back into his pocket. Such feelings were said to precede the Hermit-in-Rags, according to the first volume of *The Orchid Transfiguration*... He needed to stop being so paranoid. This place, this city, was normal. Taking a deep breath, Victor joined his friends in conversation.

He sat there in shock, That was unorthodox.  I smiled, a touch shyly as he did it again, only for my wings to flutter and fill.  He kissed me, this time and I felt better, I smiled into the kisses, letting them grow deeper as my anxiety felt like it had dissipated.",2018-06-16 06:10:03

2379,"Flutter is pretty new, so I've been learning by reading the docs and watching videos. This is a good one to [start](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5urRyqOwTuo&t=240s). I see you want to move a widget with an Align. To do this you need whatever your base class is (the parent of the Align, or the class the Align is a successor of) to have an AnimationController. You then need to initialize the controller and set it to listen to the vsync/frame counter. With this, you can control the position in an align by setting the left or right, up/down, of the Align parameters.

That's if you want full control. If you want a default widget, you can use [AnimatedAlign](https://docs.flutter.io/flutter/widgets/AnimatedAlign-class.html) which will automatically animate a change in the alignment of it's child. You can give it animation curves too (linear, bouncy, etc.) You don't need to do any background stuff for this.

Example (assume this align is a child of your app somewhere):

```
...child: new AnimatedAlign(

child: 

);

2380,"Speaking of Hell...

A man wakes up in a slum with no memory of how he got there. He wanders around aimlessly before he finds even one person who will talk to him. Some ratty beggar on the street turns out to be nice enough to explain where he is.

""You're in the afterlife!"" he tells the man, ""But you must have been a real shithead when you were alive, because this is the fourth ring, and only the worst people come here.""

All of a sudden, a siren goes off, one of those air-raid things. The man is terrified but the beggar gets up calmly and leads him to a big, dilapidated warehouse where thousands of other similarly unkempt souls are gathering. When the man asks why they're all here, the beggar points to a line of folding tables against the wall. Each table has some moldy bread, cups of dingy water, and some bowls of broth so thin they could have just run out of cups. Only then does the man realize how hungry he is. A guard in heavy body armor blows a whistle and all the people arrange themselves into three lines.

The beggar is helpful enough to explain them for the man. ""That one's the bread line, that's the broth line, and that's the water line. All the food here is free, but if you want to get out of this maggot hole, you've got to work, because the gate guards into the third ring ask five hundred dollars to get through. I've heard the food is better there.""

So the man gets his food. It's abominable, and right then and there, he vows to make five hundred dollars and get into the third ring. Unfortunately for him, very few people need work in the afterlife, especially when all of them are saving up to emigrate. Even still, after ten years of hard work, eating the moldy bread and indistinguishable soup and water, he finally saves up enough money. The guards let him through and he finds himself in the third ring. It's nothing too fancy, if anything, it's a bit below average for a real city, but to his eyes it is paradise. All the guards look much friendlier, and the houses and buildings, while not spacious or lavish, are at least up to code. And to his surprise, he runs right into a familiar former beggar as he crosses the street.

""What are the odds?"" they both ask and they get to conversing. The beggar, it turns out, only managed to make it in himself a few months back. Their conversation is interrupted, however, by what sounds like a school bell. When the man seems confused, the beggar leads him to what looks like a giant gymnasium. Here, people are gathering once again, and the man begins to understand. On a line of folding tables against one wall are stacks of hot dogs, big bowls of salad, and solo cups full of fresh lemonade. A cop shouts for everyone's attention and directs them all to stand in three lines. The beggar smiles at the man's wonder and points to each line in turn. ""That's the hot dog line, that's the salad line, and that's the lemonade line."" The man gets in each line in turn and gets himself his lunch.

While he's eating, basking in joy at not being stuck with old bread and water, the beggar encourages him, ""The best part is, halfway through the year, they switch from hot dogs, salad, and lemonade to chicken, chili, and hot chocolate. You can never get tired of it!""

Sadly, this proved not to be true. After only a few days, the man did again get tired of the same meal every day. But he knew firsthand that he could change his lot, so one day he went up to the wall of the second circle. This time the guards were asking for ten thousand dollars. Well, the man didn't like it, but he figured he had his whole afterlife ahead of him now that he was out of the fourth circle, and he could certainly take some time to save up. After ten years of hard work, it wasn't too difficult for him to keep up the work ethic, and only twenty years later, he went back to the guards of the second ring with the money in hand. He went through the gate and found himself in a glittering, clean city full of glass and steel.

And wouldn't you know it, but there, standing across the street was the same beggar, only now he was wearing a well-fitted suit. The man greeted the beggar as an old friend and they started talking again. Once again, their conversation was interrupted, only this time it was by beautiful church bells. ""Come,"" the beggar told him, ""I'll take you to the evening meal."" So the man followed and they entered a glamorous ballroom filled with beautiful attendees. Even the cops here looked good, dressed in suits and sunglasses like bodyguards. And sure enough, piled onto platters on huge mahogany tables against the far wall were plates of steak, bowls of the most delicious seafood soups, and glasses of champagne. One of the bodyguards cleared his throat loudly and politely requested that the attendees line up. Three lines were formed and the beggar pointed each line out in turn. ""That's the steak line, that's the soup line, and that's the champagne line,"" and then he added, ""and apparently here, they change the meals FOUR times a year!""

The man rejoiced, ate, and was happy, and for once felt that nothing was lacking. Four changes a year was enough for him. But one day, out of curiosity, he went up to the bodyguards that guarded the gate into the first and final ring of the afterlife and found they were asking for a million dollars to pass. Well the man was a bit disturbed by this, after all, the second ring seemed perfect to him. ""What is it,"" he thought, ""that could possibly be more wonderful than what I have here?"" That question haunted him for weeks until he came to a conclusion. He was used to working hard and he had all of eternity to save up, so he wanted, just once to see what he could possibly be missing in the first ring.

Fifty years later, he returned to the guards with a million dollars. When he stepped into the first ring he fell to his knees. The architecture was glorious and inhuman, and the bodyguard had turned into shining angels. To his surprise, someone helped him up off the street and when he looked, he realized he recognized who it was--it was the beggar he met in the fourth ring, adorned in a golden robe and glowing, and when he looked down at himself he realized he looked much the same.

The beggar laughed jovially. ""I got here only three years ago myself, but somehow I knew you would be right here behind me. I've come back to this gate every day waiting for you to make it in!"" Suddenly, the air was filled with the sound of angelic choirs and the beggar led the man off to a gigantic palace made of crystal and cloud. The room was filled with radiant citizens of the first circle and angels prepared everything. Sure enough, there was a line of massive altars against one wall, spilling over with glistening golden dragon meat, a pudding refined from clouds and dew and silk, and an ice cold tub of ambrosia and nectar ladled out individually into blindingly beautiful crystalline chalices. An angel fluttered from the ceiling and bowed silently to the assembled mass, who bowed respectfully back and then broke themselves into their lines on their own.

Smiling at the tradition, the beggar pointed to the first line. ""That's the line for the dragon meat,"" he said before turning to the next line, ""and that's the line for angeldust stew,"" then he paused, confused.

""What is it?"" the man asked his old friend.

The beggar replied, ""There appears to be no punchline.""",2018-06-16 07:28:46

2385,"I agree, the random stopping to look behind them wasn't great, but it might just be a product of their time. Compare AC2 to Unity, or rather the depiction of Italy compared to Paris. The city is active and bustling and there's plenty for your target to interact with. Enough so that there are plenty of believable reasons why they would face towards you during the mission. Walks past a food stall, turns around and heads back to buy something. Someone pushes past them, they turn around to yell at them. Someone from behind calls their name, they turn around to see who it was. Compare that to AC2's maps, where streets are basically corridors. Maybe they could have worked something out, but the cities are so much more bare, what do you do? I don't think the old games had it in them to pull off believable things like that, but you still want the mission to have *some* challenge. 

I just had one idea of how to increase challenge. The game would announce one thing, but practically speaking would actually respond to something pretty simple I think. If you're tailing from the roof tops, the target might comment ""Odd, the shadows cast on the street seem to be fluttering about,"" and look up to the roofs to see what's casting the shadows. Obviously you have to get out of sight. If the target continues to see silhouettes of people in the shadows, he'll become more agitated paranoid. Obviously the target wouldn't actually be responding to shadows, but rather the player would just be walking into triggers on the rooftops that cause those reactions. Combine that with the target seeing on the street. The first time he sees you, he shouldn't even notice you. Second time, he might do a double take. Third time, he notices you for sure. Put it all together, and it's now a mission of making sure the target doesn't lose his cool. He sees you too many times on the street, you know if he sees you again things will go wrong. So you take to the rooftops. Target's agitated, then notices shadows on the street in the shape of a person on the roof. Looks up at you. Obviously at this point if he sees you, he freaks. If not, then his paranoia continues to rise. He might start taking paths to try to lose you. At this point, the mission has evolved far beyond just leaving eagle vision on and following someone around from a distance, it's become a legitimate mission to remain unseen from someone who recognizes he has a reason to be followed and may or may not be on the lookout. Use social stealth, hide in bushes and closets and around corners. Pick rooftop paths that won't cast shadows in his line of sight. Remain engaged with how you're playing instead of just following a braindead NPC.      ",2018-06-16 09:28:46

- The fee to make Whomp move is now 3 coins.

- In 4VS minigames, 1st place 2nd place and 3rd place gain coins.

- An item with an Hidden Block on a card can be seen in the item roulette. It probably can reveal Hidden Block or function like the Hidden Block detector of Mario Party DS.

Variations of an exisiting character. They share the following basic parameters.

* Walk and Run Speed.
* General Knockback
* General Damage
* Various attacking animations
* Jump Height
* Weight

However, not EVERYTHING is the same. Advanced properties like Air Speed and move behaviours and even some move animations and Final Smashes can be changed to fit the character. Lucinas Shield Breaker and the Dark Pit Staff are good examples. I expect Daisy to have various tweaks to make her more straightforward. 

Doctor Mario is not an echo because of his weight and power. Also, Dr Tornado. If he had the spike, Dr Tornado, and NO weight and general strength changes, he would still be an echo. 

Same with Pichu (weight and running speed)

Young Link is also not one because of speed and weight. 

If Birdo got in with an inhale move and no flutter jump, she would still be an echo because the basic moveset would not be changed. 

If Dixie got in without the jetpack then she would still be an echo because the basic moveset wouldnt change. ",2018-06-16 09:49:38

*Theres always a skirt, my once-partner (and still friend) told me.  Didnt matter what color she came in, or even race.  Shed be in some kind of trouble  sometimes shaking with it and shy, sometimes bold and trying to hide it.  But no one came to the Hanged Man unless there was trouble, and if it was a skirt, it would be worse.  At least the scenery made up for it.* 

Of course, now that Ive taken over that end of the business, *Im* the skirt, so his advice and logic can get dropped into the harbor with all the other garbage Kirkwall still manages to produce.  Though he was right on one thing: no one accidentally walked into the Hanged Man.

I suppose now is when I should recite my list of charms, my height, my love of Antivan whiskey  but those have all been laid out in excruciating detail.  If you dont know them, better for me.  Anyone who wants to find things knows what table I use as an office, and thats good enough.  And for those who think excessive cleavage and fluttering eyelashes will get them a discount, they learn better pretty quickly.

Like the one looking at me in shock right now.  ButI dont have that much!  Her coal-black eyes stared into mine, but not for long.  The green was unnerving to most.  Emerald, admirers call it  including the permanent guest in my bedroom.  Others just called them green, or uncanny, or Demon-eyes, she muttered, looking down.  Youre heartless, messere.

I thanked heaven  or Haven  or the Inquisitor  that not many recognized me these days.  All the travel helped, too, but at least Varrics damned book had finally fallen out of the popular memory and off the best-seller lists, and Id never dealt well with the reporters.  Then again, hed always exaggerated my charms.  He does that.  Instead, I leaned back with my glass of white, and just looked her over.  Hightown clothes, Lowtown accent.  Another of those whod made it after the Chantry explosion, if I had to guess.  I made a mental bet: blackmail, or inconvenient relatives.  Messere, I repeated her, you knew my rates when you found me.  And if you asked any questions at all, you know I very rarely bargain.  If you cant pay, I suggest heading toward Darktown.  There are a few free agents there which work for I eyed her, other payments, as well.

She gasped.  Are you suggesting 

I just snorted.  If you walk into the Hanged Man looking like that, youve already gotten three offers on your way to the table.  She flushed.  But no, not really.  Darktown, theyll work for legitimacy, too.  More readily, even.  For a way out.  Something I didnt need.  Id already paid that bill, and in blood.

She sighed.  They cant help me.  Theyre not discreet.

And that was the stock in trade Varric had used to build the business  and that Id kept, even before Id taken over.  Names stayed with me, even if I passed him carefully edited descriptions for his damned serial.  Then pass over the deposit, cash, and start talking.

Her eyes flickered.  *Rule one: theres always a skirt.  Rule two: they always lie.*  Ah, Varric was cynical, heartbroken and reliant on Bianca at his hip.  But this one was going to lie, I decided, as she dropped down a small wad of bills.  Shed been ready to pay.  And out her story came, from her blood-red lips.  I was still astonished people actually dressed like that, as much as Id seen.

I tapped my lower lip.  Fine.  Ill ask some questions.  Your retainer will get you that much, messere?  I trailed off.

Do you really need my name?

It was all I could do to keep from rolling my eyes.  No, I can just ask questions about a child, and keep the answers to myself.  The disgust made my tone more biting than Id intended, but it had the desired effect.  Yes, I need a name.  And an address.  This is my office, but I dont live here any more than you do.

Email?

You know better than that.  I had my office, and my rep - but you couldnt  find me online.  Not with everything.unpleasant.  The Champions secret wasnt much of a secret any longer, but Id rather not paint a target on my back.

Lady Travertine.  Assumed.  Andyes, a Hightown address, not far from a nondescript path into Lowtown.  And with that, she flounced back out.

It wasnt much longer until the elf at the bar, heavily built for his kind, stalked over and dropped into the same chair shed just left, with surprising grace.  Hed brought his whiskey, and the light played off his silver hair and blue-white tattoos.  Shes lying.  His voice was low, but never failed to make my bones ache.

I just poured another glass and smiled.  Of course she is, Leto.  But the description is right.  Another mage-gifted child, vanished as soon as her powers started to show.  She didnt move like a Templar  I let my voice trail off.  It was the elf in front of me who knew them better.

He sighed.  She is not, whatever she may be.  She wasnt carrying - nothing more than a switchblade, at least.  And even now, not many know the early signs well enough to fool a mage.

I met my lovers eyes  a gorgeous jade-green, and sighed back.  Yes, that was the catch  and why I knew I was going to take this one on, even if we didnt really need the money at the moment.  We certainly had at other points, and it didnt hurt to build up a reserve.  The mage part was why Id kept a low profile, after I let Varric trot me out for a couple key speeches  because for years, until the war and the new Divine had made it all moot, thered been another word attached.  Apostate.  And Champion, which made it all very awkward, even after Knight-Commander Merediths death.  Atmy hand.  To be fair, shed tried to take my head first, but Templars in Kirkwall werent always known for being fair.  They didnt have to answer to the media - they were cowed long ago.  And for some reason, cameras didnt work well around them.  Ill look into it, at least a bit.  Hed already counted, then palmed the money on the table, so we were in.  

Youve changed, Amata.

And you say that every time, Leto.  A familiar exchange.  Who hasnt, from the war?  Besides, its this or getting a  Maker help us  real job, with a salary, and all the attendant strings attached.  He snarled.  The main string was that with a steady job, we couldnt jaunt after slavers whenever he found another ring.  And we could be found, which could be - well.  Messy.  Come on, love.  Lets find something to eat and head back to the Estate.

**

He bought meat pies from a Lowtown vendor, and handed me one  hot against my scarred palm, but I wasnt going to complain, not with the smell it let off, a promise of better to come.  It was also a chance to start spreading the retainer wed gotten.  Not that a magical trace would last long around Fenris - what had been done to him also meant he was death to enchantments - but it helped if it wasnt all in one place.  Wed learned both tricks, after a few early jobs had almost gone bad.  Early as in pre-Chantry.  He tucked two pies into a handkerchief, and bit into the fourth, juice dripping from his chin.  He glared at it, and I had to laugh.  Hed found something that annoyed him, that he couldnt simply attack.  Then I glanced up.  Wed best hurry, or well be soaked.

You cant hurry through Lowtown, not on a market day just before sundown, even if you couldnt see the sun behind the thunderclouds.  We hadnt made it more than a few blocks before the sky let loose and sheets of water dropped on the city, flattening the dust before it started splashing up, the ground too hard for the soupy mixture to do anything else.  I gave a dark-haired guard a wink - one he returned.  At least I still had a few friends, even if the Captain hadnt forgiven me for continuing to clean up her messes.  A good woman, but even now she wasnt flexible enough for the City of Chains, and Kirkwall either bent you, or broke you.  When I had the time, I did what I could to keep it from doing either to her.  It was my fault shed wound up here in the first place.

All of this, as we made our way lower, then slipped into Darktown.  Even the rain stayed away, only eerie drips making it through the layers of people and rotting wood over our heads.  I started to shiver, as the last of the clean water dripped off my wide-brimmed hat and onto my neck.  The rolled-up side was perfect for fashion twenty years ago - or an Apostate when she dared wear her staff - but meant water was channeled straight down my spine.  Not that it made much difference, when my shirt was already soaked through and my sensible skirt glued to my thighs.

Ugh.  His disgusted noise summed up the journey perfectly, as I fished out the key and opened the basement entrance.  Why were we out in this?

I ticked off my fingers as I jammed the door shut again.  One, it didnt look like rain when we headed over.  Two, we havent had a cook since the first time we left Kirkwall.  Three, you had a feeling.  Hed started up the stairs, and I followed.  Four, theres nothing wrong with lining our nest a little against the next dry spell - or the next slaver ring you uncover.  Good works, those, but not well paying.  Fifth

And hed turned as soon as he set the last pastries down.  I only had a moment to trace the lines of the tattoos against his dark skin, the shadows showing against his shirt, nearly transparent from the downpour.  And then he was pressed against me, and the reasons didnt matter any longer.",2018-06-16 14:32:48

>The workers at this plant were ""among the industry's most well-organized, racially and ethnically diverse, and militant."" A strike at this key plant could bring the company's manufacturing operations as a whole to a halt. Ford therefore decentralized operations from this plant, to soften union power (and to introduce new technologies in new plants, and expand to new markets). Ford often built up parallel production facilities, making the same products, so that the effect of a strike at any one facility would be lessened.

2417,"> You made me smile A DOZEN OR MORE times just now.

Son of a... Dammitol! Now we've gotta add Rictus to your Problem List ;-)

I'll confess, early into reading your first Post I was thinking 'Hormones, Hormones, Hormones' (The Hormones would be a great name for a motorcycle gang - probably spelled differently though) but not being an Endocrinologist, I, most uncharacteristically, kept my mouth shut ...not to mention, with your experience with eleventy-dimensional endometriosis you very (very!) likely know more about that than me.

But yes, the hormone-seizure-migraine (plus any and all other psych psymptom pstuff, like: depression, insomnia, anxiety, potential alteration [or fluctuations] of thresholds for PTSD, etc.) association makes sense when you consider that hormones and neurotransmitters are close cousins given that they are both chemical messenger systems; the neurotransmitters traveling over the short neuron-to-neuron angstrom distances, the hormones for longer gland-to-every damn where else distances via the circulatory system

Further (no anatomy pun intended), the world of migraine is truly dizzying. You most likely know of abdominal migraines, which seems a weird thing (you have a headache in your stomach?) but it gets weirder than that. e.g. there's something called 'Migraine Sans Migraine,' which, according to a world-renown migraine specialist I know, is a migraine w/o pain. ...how the Hell they discovered it is a mystery to me.

So with your planetary scale endometriosis, might many of your seemingly unconnected symptoms be traced to errantly located endometrial tissue receiving, or dispatching, messenger molecules which are way the Hell away from where they'd ever be if your endometrial tissue was of an amount and in a location we'd consider normal? And/Or despite the amount and location of that tissue, might you have abnormal receptors (anywhere, everywhere: cardiac tissue, neural tissue, GI tissue, ligamental tissue [you've had so many joint dislocations! ...did you know that the otherwise near-concrete immovable ligaments of the pelvis 'soften and stretch' just prior to pregnancy progressing to labor in order to allow delivery - and that change is mediated by hormones? might hormones, or deranged receptors, be the cause of your ligamentous laxity? ]) ...where were we? Oh, right... abnormal receptors which are dysfunctioning such that they 'recept' like lunatic wolves howling at fireflies instead of the moon. I dunno how your various receptors might be tested for normal vs abnormal behavior. Seems like that might be more in the province of researchers than clinicians but your endometriosis Doc might know.

Yet another thing I don't know is what's in the fluid of your circus of cysts. What sort of molecules are within cystic fluid? Damn certain the fluid is not pure H2O - well, probably damn certain. Damn certain I do not know. But I'd bet it is not pure H2O. Anyway - Might the fluid of your cysts contain a type, or number, of molecule(s) [X] than that which is usually found in lesser symptomatic polycystic ovary cysts and/or cysts of the kidney? 
Does cystic fluid typically get assessed - maybe run through a chromo column? Has the contents of the fluid within your cysts ever been assessed? Could randomly bursting cysts be randomly releasing some type of messenger molecule - or aberrant messenger molecules - which now and then and now, and now, and now...  direct carotid receptors, for instance, or renal receptors - to elevate your BP? Or, otherwise mess with the usual regulation of increased HR -> decreased BP, decreased HR -> increased BP? Might randomly bursting cysts release a neurotransmitter-like substance that flood your brain and cause seizures?

But enough about the vast amount I do not know (flutters eyelids), I think it is pretty clear you **really do need** a medical Ring Master to serve as the central point person to both go to bat for you, and pull all this seemingly disparate stuff together. To look into research trials you could participate in - or find a person who can do that search.

I suspect you have been in the position of *pressing* people to: see a Doc, get a test, find a counselor, Do, Go, Get whatever thing they just have to Do, Go, Get, Find, See, Ask... Well Champ, it might be time to sit down in front of a mirror and convince that freckle-faced redhead it is past time to stop leaving other medical people alone, Go and Get yourself a Doc who can do the Ring Master role. I do not even know you but I am absolutely certain there are doctors - or people you know who know the right Docs - that would immediately take on the task, if they only knew that's what you need.

And CrushingPower, Baby, you DO need that help. Get out of your own way, don't hesitate, no more being Mister Nice Girl, and in just the blink of an eye you'll be in that world and on the move. Just a fact Baby, Go.

The heart monitor marked the slowing of her heart beats, the beeps getting farther and farther apart each passing minute. The looks from the nurses told me it was only a matter of time until it was all over. I picked absentmindedly at a loose string hanging from the sling holding my arm tight against my body.

I hadn't seen the car coming, because I had been yelling into the back seat at her. I couldn't even remember what I had been yelling about, but it didn't matter right now. She looked so small lying in the hospital bed, her golden curls on the pillow. I wished for a way to take her home, to make her safe again.

The heart monitor beeped out a warning that the nurse quickly shut off. Her eyes fluttered open and my heart leapt with a momentary hope. I wished to apologize, to tell her it was my fault. Her eyes closed again, and my sorrow ballooned once more.

I prayed the way only a broken man can. Nobody was saying anything, we all just waited. The doctor walked in the room silently. Was time starting to run out?

She opened her eyes again. I smiled at her.

It was happening.

His wife is UX. I don't even know what that means. Do they both take drugs
or does it excite it? Do they excite together? And why is this actually 
relevant? Can you enjoy the flutter drugs only as a team? It is more like
a pseudo-religion like scientology? Are these spouse-spouse hacker

I know Linus and Matz do not have this combination. Perhaps that is why
they are not that SUPER EXCITED every second sentence either - or

Google Groups??? People still use that?

SO is good in general; just hostile in many ways, too. It's sort of

Groups. Do non-Google people really make use of that?

What the ...

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dart_%28programming_language%29

First appeared: October 10, 2011; 6 years ago

So, yeah ... IT HAS BEEN AROUND FOR YEARS.

I guess ""two"" counts as well since ... it is, years. Plural. And 6
years that's like ... a bit more than HALF A DECADE.

So yeah, Dart has been around for such a long time, almost
as long as UNIX. You read it first on that blog - Dart has been
around for years... implies stability. \o/

Actually, the Dart team retrofitted their goals and the language.

They once had the ambition to kill JavaScript. Then they suddenly
dropped that and changed the language as well. Nobody understood
it at that time - until it was revealed that Dart would be used for
FuchsiaOS. And now suddenly it all makes sense - all to make
Google richer.

> learning is very easy as it is more established and battle tested.

6 years being around means... learning is very easy? Because it
is ... more established and ""battle tested""? Huh? Battle tested
HOW exactly?! And how does this lessen any problems that you
can find in a language?

I sort of doubt these articles to be written without payment.

People who have seriously used Objective C are very suspect.

Even Apple moved to another language.

Not really.

They will be much better off using Ruby or Python. Yes, they
don't have the same user interface focus as you have for
Dart - after all it's what Google tries to build up. But they have
a much more general purpose language and are less dependent
on Google, too.

Double-win for the KO.

> I just cant believe how many I hear complaining theyd have

I can completely understand it. Why invest time to learn such a
useless language in the first place? And people have a lot of
better things to do for these two hours a day.

> Google team members and friends should to continue

People seriously use google groups?

I think most people will use SO, even if they are going to use
Dart (props to these fearless heroes who do, unless they are
google worker drones).

Again - the best support team is useless if the language is crap.

The WSL team at Microsoft are great, competent and helpful -
but they are basing their code on the awful shittiness that is
the (closed source) windows base.

> For example, the Center widget is nice for a Hello, World

Have you people still not learned from CSS? Why do we need
a special widget called center in the first place to setup styling?

All in one it sounds incredibly boring. I applaude anyone who 
loves that kind of ... work without being a worker drone employed
somewhere just HAVING to say that. But it most assuredly sounds
utterly boring. In fairness - ruby on rails is also hugely boring.

A lot of the www world is so AMAZINGLY boring that it's quite

A blinking red vacancy sign illuminated the damp country road and reflected off the puddles in the motel parking lot. She pleaded with her fussing infant secured in a car seat in the backseat as she pulled into the lot and parked in front of the motel's front office. The headlights caught the attention of the half-asleep concierge a wrinkled woman with tied up white hair and a Ferelden flag shirt that flooded her slender frame. Morrigan killed the engine and twisted to the backseat, unfastening her child from his car seat and clutching him to her breast and bobbing him in her arms. She hushed him as his croaking coughs and cries filled the car. Once she was certain he settled, she entered the motel's front office and greeted the waiting concierge.  
  
The concierge cooed at the pouting child and received his curious eyes. She glanced up to Morrigan and asked if she needed a room. Morrigan nodded, rocking the child in her arms. The concierge asked for identification. Morrigan paused and looked into the conceirge's waiting eyes. Morrigan shook her head, ""I am capable of paying of you in cash.""  
  
The concierge slunk away from the desk and pointed at a framed print out of the motel's policies. ""No ID, no room.""  
  
""Please,"" she said, a knot in her throat forming at the sound of her child croaking an ugly cough. ""He is not well. Do not force us to spend another night in the car.""   
   
The concierge blew a heavy breath out of her pursed lips and flicked her eyes between Morrigan and her child, the worry on the young mother's face sparking a heavy prick of pity in the old woman's chest. After a moment of contemplation, the concierge nodded and told Morrigan an extra fee would be tacked on for the breach in policy. Morrigan left a stack of cash on the desk and snatched the room key from the concierge's outreached hand. The concierge suggested that Morrigan bring her baby to a doctor in the morning, arguing that a cough like his could prove fatal for one so young. Morrigan acknowledged at concierge's advice and left the office, using the canopy covered sidewalk to avoid the rain.  
  
The motel room smelt of stale beer. The walls were a phlegm-colored yellow with thin grey carpet splotched with stains. A single bed sat in the middle of the small room with an outdated television set perched on a dresser in front of the foot of the bed. She threw her pack onto the hexagon patterned bedspread and carried her child into the bathroom, shutting the door behind them. Her child began to wail, his sobs only broken by sporadic coughing fits. She sat on the lid of the toilet seat and reached into the shabby shower, twisting the faucet to its hottest setting. The shower head sputtered, then rained with a low-pressure stream of scorching water. They sat in the steaming bathroom until the infant's cough ceased and his cries became small blubbers.  
   
She exited the bathroom, her son fluttering in and out of sleep in her arms. She searched her pack for embrium and propped herself against the creaking headboard of the motel bed, crushing the embrium in the empty dish meant for complimentary mints and chocolate. She summoned a small flame to her fingertip and ignited the embrium, the soothing smell of earth and flower petals overwhelming the tiny room.   
  
The television remote was fastened the nightstand with velcro beside the room's telephone. She tore the remote from the nightstand and tapped the power button. The tv fizzled awake and presented a grainy picture of the eleven o'clock news.  
   
*""Warden-Commander Damon Cousland, hailing from Fereldan's very own Highever, received a medal from King Alistair today,""* the voice of a female newscaster buzzed from the television set. Footage of Alistair and Damon flickered on the screen, bright smiles cemented on their faces.   
   
Damon's face filled the frame of the television screen, the reporter's microphone poking into the shot. *""Countless men and women gave their life to stop this blight right here in Denerim. This medal is just as much theirs as it is mine.""*  
  
The anchors appeared on screen, gushing about Damon's accomplishments and their gratitude for his heroics. Morrigan's chest tightened as more rolls of footage featured Damon in pristine warden formal attire engaging with citizens and shaking hands with nobles and dignitaries. The television flashed off, the black screen reflecting Morrigan's face from afar. She swallowed, glancing down at the sleeping child in her arms.   
   
He resembled his father when he slept: lips pursed with hands urging for something to coddle. She brushed the back of her hand against the peaceful child's cheek, the ring on her finger glistening beneath the motel room's dull overhead light. Her eyes flicked to the cradled beige telephone on the nightstand. She grabbed the receiver, her fingers shaking as she pressed her fingers against the numbered keys and held the phone to her ear, holding her breath as the phone purred the ring back tone. Her eyes closed as she bit down on her bottom lip.  
  
The line went quiet until a hoarse voice muttered, ""Hello?""   
   
Morrigan blinked tears from her eyes, her teeth digging into her lip to suppress any emerging sound from her quivering lips. Her tongue wished to speak, to tell him she was wrong, that she wanted him beside her, to fight through the fires of Hell together. The ring on her finger sent a shiver of sorrow up her arm that settled in her chest.  
   
""Morrigan?"" Damon's voice murmured. A heavy sigh whorled through the line. ""Morrigan, please please, say something. Are you okay?"" She pressed the receiver to her chest, letting out a ragged breath and struggling to swallow a sob down her constricting throat. She returned to the phone to her ear, listening to the inconsistent rhythm of his breaths on the other line. ""I know you said to let you go"" a winded breath disturbed the line ""Let me find you. Bring you home. Me, you, and the baby we can go wherever you want, just the three of us, I don't care. Tell me where you are. I can't"" his voice broke ""I thought I could do this... I can't, Mor. Please, I'll find you. I love""  
  
She dropped the receiver into its cradle and craned her neck toward the ceiling, taking in slow breaths to kill the sick swirl that raged in her stomach. She wiped her cheeks and held her child closer. She relied on the rational thoughts in her mind to deafen the demands her heart desired.   
   
*Love,* she heard her mother's voice hiss in her head. *Love is a weakness.*

It started with her foot tingling, as if shed been sitting on it, then the sensation spread up her leg slowly before settling in her chest. She could almost swear she could see someone looking at her, or something, huge eyes against the faintly white ceiling. She sighed, gathering her energy. Hello?

How do you live? She felt the voice more than heard it, deep and rumbling, crawling across her skin. Despite the strange sensations, she wasnt afraid, just confused and a little irritated at the shocked tone of whatever was talking to her.
Im sorry? Her words were sharp, but the eyes didnt flinch.

Your emotions are dark. Unpalatable, inedible. They burn my being. How do you live?

Taking criticism had never been one of her strong suits, and the depression didnt help that. She sat up and the shadow disappeared before reforming at the end of the bed. One day at a time, just like anyone else.

The shadow had stopped fluttering, landing in a semi-permanent form of a round ball with skinny legs and arms. Between blinks shed lose track of those huge eyes and giant mouth, so faintly was the being colored. What even are you, anyway?

The mouth parted, revealing a grin of needle teeth. Yes, now that I can consume. The mouth closed and its jaw worked, before the form rippled and sighed. In your language, I am an emotion eater. I feed on the spare energies of humanity, drawing my strength from your existence. You, however It trailed off, and she felt it thinking. I have never seen your sadness before.

She had a momentary flashback to her therapists office, and the shock and disbelief on the professionals face when shed said it took incredible energy to make a day good. Some days, she just chose to not make that effort, to not fight the negativity, and just have a bad day. That same distress had been evident on the therapists face, as was on this thing in front of her. Its next words shocked her back to reality.

I will find a solution. And with that, the shadow faded away, melting into nothing. She stared after it, mystified. **What was that about?**

Over the next few months, she was randomly visited by the being. It was careful to find her when she was already awake, though she supposed with the insomnia it was easier than she though. Every time, it brought a pouch filled with a powder or rock or some various item that was sprinkled or rubbed on her. There was always a brief tingle before the being would sigh in disappointment, say its farewell and disappear again. 

It hadnt been a particularly good day, and she was brooding upright in bed before trying to sleep. The shadow appeared earlier than normal and seemed excited. I have the answer. This will improve it.

She stared balefully at the nothingness in front of her. Yeah, you know youve said something to that effect since you started this, right?

It paused. You are upset at the time this has taken. Time is meaningless to me, I am eternal. But perhaps after tonight, it will not matter. It emptied the pouch into its hand, floating onto the bed and letting the dust settle over her. It smelled vaguely earthy, a little funky, almost like someone had dumped a vacuum bag. **Maybe it is**

The familiar tingle happened, and the same confused reaction came from the shadow. It disappeared again, reforming at the end of the bed. You have resisted all of the flavors. This is...unexpected. I have nothing left to offer you. Your sadness cannot be made appealing. It stopped and she felt the uncertainty. How many more of you are there? How many others have this sort of...unpleasant...sadness?

A cold rage filled her and the shadow faded away across the room. What the hell kind of question is that? I dont eat emotions, I dont know how many of us arent tasty. If youre asking how many of us are depressed, then theres millions of us. Millions of folks barely functioning, barely appearing to be perfectly normal sane, happy humans, while going home to our darkness to rot. I couldnt tell you an exact number. Its not our job to be appealing to your kind though, so fuck off.

It stared at her, unblinking, before nodding with its whole round body. There are many more whose emotions can be consumed. I will not return here.

Just as before, the shadow faded, but there was a finality she wasnt sure why she felt. She was suddenly drowsy, and she curled up to go to sleep. Her last thought was that perhaps tomorrow would be a good day, after all.",2018-06-16 20:53:07

You're correct, I'd usually debug through F5 and take advantage of the hot reload on save, but it's been buggy for me. I've got the Flutter plugin for VS Code (but I think it depends on the Dart plugin, right) but I'm hesitant to use the debugging features. In my experience, whenever I save new changes while running debugging, it hot reloads forever, and hot restarting doesn't help - it says a reload is already in progress.

There was a bug a while back that caused reload timeouts; I can't remember if the fix has made the beta branch yet. If you can reproduce any issues using the current dev or master channels of Flutter then it's definitely worth opening an issue [on GitHub](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues) for me to investigate. Flutter Run and Observatory logs ([see here](https://dartcode.org/docs/logging/)) are usually useful for investigating those sorts of issues; but even a description of the issue and the messages from the Debug Console are worthwhile.

If you're considering moving to So Paulo which is quite a big job market  there's one more tech that *may* be worth keeping an eye on, called Flutter.

2484,"I apologize for this really long post.  But your experiences really struck a cord with me as they are so similar to mine. 

I live in a rural unincorporated area.  The nearest town is about 15 minutes drive. Its a small town with a single Main Street. 

I rent a cottage on an a private estate that has been in the same family for five generations.  All told, there are five homes scattered over the estate. Only two homes are occupied full time.  The other three homes are used as weekend/holiday residences by the owners. 

The estate is set back about half a mile from the main road. It was built between 1900 and 1920s, so not new, but not terribly old either. 

The cottage I rent was originally a bunkhouse for full time staff of the main house.  Since its adjacent to the main house, its built in the same Antebellum style architecture.  The building was converted into a single unit, but the exterior architecture remains intact as the estate is on the historic register. 

There are deep balconies on each side of the house, each running the full length of the building. Since it was designed to house staff, it was originally 5 separate rooms. Each room had a front and back door, so there are ten exterior doors. 

The unit set vacant for two or three years before I moved in. The previous tenant was an employee of the estate. 

By day, its it is a picturesque.  It is surrounded by an array of formal gardens replete with fountains, Cherub statuary, sculpted hedgerows, and even the requisite estate old world rose garden.  A creek with ivy covered banks runs through the center of the property. 

The expansive grounds are shaded by majestic sycamore and oak trees. The property backs up to a low mountain range that is covered with evergreens and old growth oak.  

By day, it is breathtakingly beautiful.

Yet at night, it takes on a heaviness.  At dusk, the coyotes howl as they leave their dens for their nightly hunt. An almost ominous sounding of the deep dark to follow as the last rays of sunlight slip beneath the mountain ridge. 

Shortly after I moved in I begin to hear and sense the presence of an other. 

It began with the sound of an exterior door slamming shut. I was so startled I called the sheriff.  They sent two deputies out to search the grounds.  Of course they found nothing.

Some days later I was sitting quietly reading when a sudden drop in temperature so sudden and deep made me reach for a ijacket to stop my shivering.

As the chill came on, the room filled with the scent of perfume. A soft scent, spicy, exotic, warm. It always set me at ease. 

Then every night between 9:57 PM and 10:03 Id hear a knocking on the various exterior doors on the backside of the house. Although there are trees on the backside, the deep porches make it impossible for the branches to come anywhere near the exterior walls. I took to leaving the back porch lights on, waiting, listening, then looking and always nothing...just the knocking to shatter the silence. 

Objects would disappear then reappear some days later in another room. Initially I thought I absent-mindedly moved things about.   But it happened with such frequency, I begin to take mental notes as I placed things down: I am placing this book, at this time, on this date, on this table, in this room.  

I ended up purchasing several pair of reading glasses because my glasses kept disappearing, then reappearing some days later in a room I never use for anything other than storage. I dont read or relax in that roomthere isnt even a chair in that room to sit and read.  

I am an atheist.  I dont believe in gnomes, leprechauns, gods, or ghosts. Death to dust as I have no concept of God.  Yet these things kept happening. And I kept sensing something, an other.   Yet, I could not rationalize it. I could not explain it. So I refused to believe it.

But when a friend experienced it, not once, but on two separate occasions, I had to acknowledge it s real. The first time was a strange scraping noise. I heard it but didnt say anything as I didnt want to sound crazy. But then he asked if I heard the noise. I told him I heard it, and although it was not the first time, I had no idea where it originated. 

The second time it was footsteps on the front porch. He said, theres somebody walking around out there, do you hear it?  He then looked out said, I dont see anyone.  

For months I lived in fear of the night. And then one day I just snapped. I got really angry.  I screamed that I had had enough that I was not going to live fearful in my own house. I screamed it was my house, that I was a respectful tenant, they needed to get out as they were not respectful of me.  

I felt like a total idiot screaming in a seemingly empty room. But I was beyond frustrated. 

I then researched methods to clear my space of spirits.  I purchased sage. I purchased black tourmaline. I place one piece under my pillow. The other I kept in my knapsack.  

Every afternoon for two or three weeks I saged inside and around my house. I went from room to room reciting prayer, taking ownership of my space, telling all it was my sacred space and no one was to enter my space without invitation.

 After a couple of weeks pretty much everything stopped. I still smell that perfume now and again, still feel the cold air. I still see wisps of fluttering light. 

But most of the nerve-racking tapping, scratching, and knocking has stopped.

The reasons they're less developed are due to time constraints and the fact that the Material components can be (almost) fully styled to meet the requirements of most custom designs. Having something that is high quality (generally), whilst catering for people who want to implement their own custom designs was top priority.

It's also important to separate Flutter itself from the Cupertino widgets. Flutter itself is already in use by many awesome, big, apps in production. So don't hesitate to use it!

I'm positive full iOS visual experience is important to Google as that's why the Cupertino widget set exists. The best way to push the process forward is to log issues on GitHub so the devs know what you need.

2505,"The village they had stumbled upon was the usual endpoint for travelers coming from the south. In recent centuries the Rals had spilled out of their mountain homes to invade and colonize the gravely plains here, driving off the inhabitants to lands further away. All these lands were windswept and bare. The wet clouds that dumped rain on the eastern faces of the great Jaraghat range turned to dry wisps of air on the western slopes, leaving little moisture beyond that which short grasses and shrubs could subsist on. Nestled at the end of a valley that marked the beginning of the foothills of the Ghjar proper, on a sandstone mount, sat the town which had fascinated that party of strangers. Only at the valleys base did enough moisture collect to feed a small stream, along its sides drystone walls guarded plots of highland grasses. 

The Xaskarians made their way cautiously down the road that twisted its way along the rivers bank. A round watchtower guarded the entrance to the town, though the roads precipitous climb up the bare face of the mount was protection enough for most invaders. They tried to interact with the few farmers they saw, but the locals clearly avoided further contact. The people here were short and haggard, with clothing that might have once had color but now only matched the earthen tones of the dust that incessantly blew across the valley. The town itself was a mess of white plastered houses that clustered around the top of the mount, their doorways facing inwards to bare thick, windowless walls to the outside world. Puffs of smoke rose from every house. 

The party walked up the road and passed the watchtower. It had a single window in it, but within no guard. A set of stone stairs led into a built up plaza in the center of the town. The stairs were worn down with many years of foot traffic, but were now entirely bare and quiet. Walking up to the plaza proper, the xaskarians found themselves in a small bazaar, but with only a few vendors and simple goods laid out on fibrous mats. 

From windows, doorways, and alleyways, curious faces poked out to catch a glimpse of the strange pale outsiders, though they were quick to duck back down when the strangers looked in their direction. One of the vendors, a short merchant named Balad, had been hawking rolls of firewood from the forests to the north when the strangers were cited outside the town. Frightened by their appearance, most of the people had fled to their houses, but he had stayed out in his stall, if only because he had no home here to flee to. Yet, when they walked into the towns plaza, he found himself still struck by their alien features. They for all the world were like people hewn from crystal, with angular faces and skin and hair the color of mountain ice. He sat up, gathering his robes around him. He inspected and then consumed a small piece of medicinal herb, catching the eye of the veiled woman among them, her mouth hidden behind a pale grey scarf that fluttered behind her head.

2510,"I never had a gf but recently fell in love with a co-worker and I think she loves me too. 

Here's my 2 cents. I think when you find the one... you would care for that person and will always want to talk to that person.  

I think I  found that person you're talking about.

For me it's always thinking about that person when going to bed or getting up in the morning. Knowing her favorite things to do and eat.  The person  should feel  the same.

The co-worker I am in love with  shows she cares about me. Lectures me on my diet and  always looks into my eyes and smiles. Always melts my heart the way she looks at me. 

Anyways, I feel when you find the one you have to have feelings for the person. You heart should flutter and you should feel butterflies in your stomach. You should also get kinda aroused around the person.  The person should make you feel  happy at all times when you're around them.  They would always be there for you. If you call the person at 1am they shouldn't be pissed. They should be happy that you called.

For me if my co-worker called me at 3am and needed help. I would be thrilled and it's due to the fact that she trusts me enough to rely on me for important things.   You should feel these things and things should just click. I am not married nor like I  said never had a GF.  However, I  know I fell in love with a co-worker and just recently found out a lot of info about her that see feels that same but I already knew that form just the convo we have. 

My point is that you both will have feelings. They will treat you the same as any family member of theirs. They will respect you and will be concern about you about your health and other things. They won't care how much you make. Even if you end up homeless if they feel happy when around you then even  if you both were homeless that person would still be happy that you stook around by their side. 

This is how I feel about my co-worker and she feels the same  just by interacting. The issue for me is that she's going to college in another state for 2 years and she already has a BF but her actions tell me she's into me and some events recently confirmed it.   My point if you found the one you're supposed to get married. That person will make so much effort to support you and defend you. They would never want to hurt you at all and will make everything easy and  it would take a lot to make them upset or make them hate you.  Thinks would just fall in place and there shouldn't be any  issues and if there's any issues they would bring it up in a polite manner that is respectful. You both would work together to fix those issues. If  for some reason you fight or don't listen to one another  or have communication problems. Then that person  isn't the one.  If a person loves you will they strive at all costs to keep you around them. So, if they have an issue with you  they will spend time thinking how they can bring the issue up without getting you upset about it.  Trust me you will know if  the person is the one and it's due to that there shouldn't be any work needed to be put into the relationship. You and the other person would just know what to do and say and the other person will always try and not get upset or lose their cool. You both would want each other around and you both want communication and  both give each other respect and be respectful when addressing issues.  My point is that the relationship should be getting easier the longer you know each other and you both should have mutual respect and open communication. You should be able to tell your boyfriend anything  without worrying what he will do with that info.  You should't have trust issues.  If  the guy is shady or you see them running around with other girls or talking to other girls and going to clubs meeting girls. It's a bad sign. The guy would always invite you over or out. He would see you as the center of his universe.  When you see these signs you know he's the one. ",2018-06-17 02:58:43

So a few weeks ago, when /u/loserlame kicked off these informal chats again, I said that I needed to make some new traditional ribbon camp skirts.  Here's a pic of how 1 of mine turned out:  [https://i.imgur.com/dTurNKR.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/dTurNKR.jpg) 

My sewing machine broke so the whole thing is all hand stitched together & lol...w/lots of pellon & no-fray for the ribbon part.  I don't know if a White man invented Pellon....but we have an old long running joke (as in it's more of an acknowledgment) in our family about saying when we're impressed by something.... ""Ooo-w...that White man, he's sooo smart!"" & then we all laugh.    

I still need to bead around the applique flower border cut-outs.  I should have done that before, but I was crunched to get it done it time for a Gathering to Honor Elders celebration where I volunteered in the kitchen.

Traditionally in the old days, women in my tribe used to bite birch bark to make the designs for the applique cut outs.  Isn't that something?!!  Not being able to see the outline of the design when it's in your mouth ...I can't even imagine doing that!  I had lots of trouble seeing what I was cutting using scissors.  My flowers were supposed to have stems at the bottom, but I accidentally cut 1 off, so I went w/the flow & cut them all off. lol! ",2018-06-17 04:33:26

2522,"The straps would not hold for long. I knocked him out with a sleeping spell a little over three hours ago, and the spell only lasts for three and a half at most. He was already stirring, his body shuddering as his system flushed out the last remnants of the spell. His mouth letting out low moans, his head restlessly turning back and forth, and digits that curled and relaxed intermittently as his muscles and psyche fought the powerful effects of the magic. I could have kept him under for longer, but anything over three hours runs the risk of death to the user. The department is already under fire for accidentally overdosing a dozen dark mages this past year. It cannot afford anymore bad publicity, or it's efforts will be stopped by top officials. A big reform movement had swept through the government, and abuse of the underclass would not be tolerated by the public nor the upper castes any longer.

""How long will it take?"", I ask the department chemist. He's a whiz, but this case is testing his alchemy limits. 

""Just a few more steps.""

This type of dark magic is way more powerful than simple street tricks. This is the type of magic kingpins and underworld bosses have, and they do not hand it out lightly. He has none of the trappings of an lower-class big shot. His clothes are rags, he's underweight, his hair is greasy, and above all he is barely a teenager. Kids his age barely have enough dark magic to swipe coins from pockets and distract shop owners while they steal bread, not fight off an entire squad of police officers. We underestimated him, and unfortunately we paid the price. That is why we had to use such a powerful spell. We tried using low-level charms and he shrugged all of them off like a light sneeze. 

Like anything else in society, magic was separated along caste lines. The rich, high-status, and purebred were given access to sorcery at first, believing it to be their God-given right to wield it. They made the right decisions, they felt, and these decisions almost always benefited themselves at the expense of those beneath them. They thought they could keep it away from their subjects forever. That is until it started to slowly leak out from their estates and manors. The poor did not have the education to wield pure magic, so they changed it into a twisted more corrupt version. Dark magic is more violent in nature, focused on illusion and destruction rather than enhancing natural abilities and healing the body. Naturally, this became a problem as crime turned rampant, and dark magic was considered a threat to national security. Killing dark magicians was par the course, but after an expose and public outcry, the department developed ways to rehabilitate these wayward mages. 

""I'm done."" The chemist held up the concoction that would get rid of this powers once and for all.

""Give it to him. Quick!"" Both of us huddled over the boy. He was still unconscious, but rapidly coming to. When I held his head up to receive the potion, his neck tensed under my hand. We needed to act now. 

The chemist slowly poured the liquid down the boy's throat as I held his head upright. The way the potion works is this. As soon as it enters their body it immediately begins to shut down the recipient's magical abilities. First, the user loses his ability to use magic on others. Second, the user loses the ability to create and maintain illusions. Third, the potion taps into the user's deepest magical reserves, taking away their magical sensitivity entirely and permanently. Once administered the recipient loses all magical powers and ability, dark or otherwise. Because of this special case, the chemist had to add to the formula to make it more powerful. It took him a while, and it should work.

As the last drops enter his throat, his eyes start to flutter open. I'm not scared. Detainees wake up all of the time when they are administered the potion. Usually they just thrash, scream, and give up after a few minutes when they realize they can no longer use dark magic to escape. I'm not scared that he is awake, but I am astonished that his eyes are blood red. I've never seen that before. After we finished we both stepped back. It is only a matter of time now.

Slowly then, one by one, each of the buckle straps unlocked. Not by the boy's hands, but seemingly by themselves. I immediately lunged to restrain him. He stopped me cold, none of my limbs being able to move, and with no physical contact, sent me flying into the back wall. He did the same to the chemist, except he flew him head-first into the ceiling. I was alone. In a last ditch effort I tried to conjure a repelling spell, but my hand was paralyzed and I did not have strength. 

With all of the straps unlatched, the boy levitated in the air. He was not angry or nervous as I predicted, but oddly calm, as if he was assured of the outcome. I could do nothing but look up at him. With a kind of serenity he looked at me and spoke for the first time

2526,"If you read what JH wrote on HW's instagram he wrote that almost every night HW had gone through a lot with who he was going to choose. When he gave YJ the reassurance that she is his first choice and she is the one that he sees he can be with for a long time, I wonder why he had said such things when he struggled with suppressing his feelings for HJ. He knew that YJ had insecurities about HJ and he knew himself that inside he also struggled with his feelings for HJ so I guess the issue that people are upset about is how he had given her a lot of affirmation and reassurance when there were indications that he had feelings for her. We did not see clips and footages that were not edited into the show so we don't know what YJ saw that made her jealous a lot. Like I said before, they never showed the part where they all went bowling or went out to places but in conversations they would talk about it. We don't know what happened and we should just try to understand everyone. Honestly, I never was into HW and I was never a part of the HW/YJ ship since I didn't like HW much but he had fault and so did YJ and I feel like we shouldn't downgrade anyone's character. But, my only criticism is the reassurance that he tried to give her while continuing to do actions that made her insecure and in the end her worst fear came true. Some people say that it is because of her actions that caused this to occur but who knows, maybe HW was actually nice and flirty to HJ sometimes which made her feel that way and in the end HW just realized he would rather just end up with HJ, the one who makes his heart flutter. The fact that he even told YJ straight up that HJ makes his heart flutter would create mental and emotional pain for her and he should know that but the fact that he told her means that he himself has realized it and it may be too late for him to forget that. How can he date YJ when he knows he gets all giddy and his heart flutters for another girl? YJ had fault here of course. Both parties are at fault and for some reason people are just trying to pinpoint it on one person but we should acknowledge that YJ was probably really hurt in all of this and we can tell when she realizes HW is not coming for her in the end.",2018-06-17 05:35:38
2527,"I broke up with my girlfriend of three years about 5 weeks ago. Your post kind of gave me a flutter, especially because we also spent three years preparing our future, where to move, where to live, and when to have a family. It's also really hard to believe that that's gone. 

So I seriously considered for about three seconds that my ex might have just made a reddit account, but then I realized how badly that was wishful thinking (we didnt end on good terms, and she definitely wants to go on other dates). 

To be honest, it sounds like he's already mentally prepared a future without you in it. It sort of invalidates all of the plans you made. That sucks. Sometimes guys tell girls that ""if we're meant to be together then we'll be together"" as a way of making the break up easier (for both parties). Breaking up because he doesn't think he can help you grow also sounds like a platitude to make the break up easier.

I guess what I'm saying is: don't hold on to false hope. That's going to make getting over it a lot harder and take a lot longer. ",2018-06-17 06:20:55

2538,"""Hey."" The deranged girl with the chef's knife had already cleared out most of the burger joint with her mere presence. Only one employee remained, standing as stiff as a board behind his register. Across from her, stood the boy clad in shadows, sipping on the Oreo milkshake he'd received just moments before the maniac arrived. ""Nice letter opener you've got there.""

The room grew noticeably colder as the girl took another step towards him. He laughed before sucking down what he could of the milkshake and setting it on the table behind him.

""I prefer 'people opener,'"" she said with a perverse giggle.

""Classy. Suppose there's no way to make it all go back to how it was?"" the boy offered. The girl shook her head, bringing the knife to her own face, caressing her cheek with the edge. Thin lines of blood began to run down her skin, staining the pale white and tarnishing the cheap steel of her weapon. The boy just shrugged. His jacket flared out, and in an incomprehensibly fast motion, he drew two knives of his own. ""Was afraid you'd say that. You know, I you so much when you told me how far things had gotten. Told you I'd fight your demons for you, that I'd protect you.""

""Didn't think you'd be forced to break at least one of those, would you?""

""No, I guess I didn't."" He flipped the knives around, holding them both in a reverse grip, but otherwise remained relaxed, the blades hanging at his sides. ""I don't know if Katelyn is still in there. If that girl I fell in love with is still, really, *truly* there. Or if you shadows have destroyed her completely. I'm not sure which I'd prefer, to be honest.""

""Do you want to know?""

""Not really.""

""Then let's dance, you and me. Just like we used to!""

The girl lunged at him, stabbing forward with the chef's knife wildly. He shifted to the side, barely dodging the attack, raking one of the blades across her arms at the same time. He took a few steps back as she turned to face him again, returning the distance between them to what it was when they both started. She grinned, staring at her arm as blood trickled down and into her hand.

""You've gotten faster,"" the boy observed.

""You're hurting me,"" the girl replied, sounding offended.

""That tends to happen in a fight, yes.""

""But you're not killing me. You want to make me suffer first.""

""Your brother was my friend, too, once. And you killed him. So yeah, maybe I do.""

She lunged at him again, exactly as before, with similar results. She stared at the wound, and began to laugh.

""Across, not along. You really want me to stick around, don't you?"" she observed, her tone almost playful. ""Always so sadistic when you wanted to be.""

""Are your parents dead, too?""

""What do you care?""

""Because Katelyn loved them. She loved her brother.""

""Don't talk about me like I'm not here.""

""You're not. You're not Katelyn. You're her shadow.""

""Whatever helps you sleep at night, babe.""

She began attacking him in earnest, but only found herself bleeding from a dozen or so wounds. Her essence had drifted across the tiled floor, making footing uncertain and sending gory splashes of red up with each step. The boy's combat knives were splattered with the substance, the blades dripping with her lifeblood whenever there was a pause. It was occuring to the employee, now, that the amount of blood lost was unnatural. She was bleeding, yes, but not growing paler than she had been upon walking in. Her steps were just as certain they were, grip just as steady as it had ever been. The cuts still wept crimson tears, and yet she did not relent, attacking the boy again and again.

""Stop,"" he said faintly. ""You won't win.""

""I was *always* the strongest between us. What makes you so sure now?""

""Because the real Katelyn would have hit me by now. She was competitive. You, though...you're enjoying this. You *want* me to hurt you. That's why you sought me out.""

""And so what if I wanted to fight you? I'd have taken you by now. Made you my plaything.""

""But you haven't. Because you can't. She's still in there, holding back, isn't she?""

""Wishful thinking never looked good on you, babe.""

""She is,"" the boy said evenly. ""And she's begging me to end it.""

""She is,"" the girl agreed. ""But want to know a secret? All this pain you've given me, do you really think it's *me* feeling it? No, *she* is the one being made to suffer. In your desire to torture the dark, the dark tortured your beloved using your own precious blades. Isn't that perfect?""

""She gave herself to you, in the end. I have a feeling she deserves it either way,"" the boy argued. ""In fact, I can pretty much pinpoint the exact moment she slipped away. She still had control when Miranda died, didn't she?""

The girl leapt at the boy once more, and their bloody dance resumed for some time. The girl never once touched her opponent, the boy moving too quickly and too deftly to be hurt. In return, his knives left cuts and gashes all along her body. Two brutal slits in an ""x"" shape on her back. Numerous cuts across her arms, a cut above the forehead, gashes leading down from her temple to somewhere along her cheek. Her blood...however much of it she had lost...it never seemed to clot or stop flowing. But as the fight wore on, the nameless employee noticed something else. Black fog seems to mix in the crimson fluid, and as more of this fog leaked out, the expected results of so much blood loss became more apparent. Their banter died with her ability to speak clearly. Her movements grew sluggish and ill-considered. Soon, she stood straight up, and allowed the knife to fall from her hands. The boy raised an eyebrow, but kept his blades at his sides.

""Alistair?"" The voice asked. It had changed. The snide tone in it had shifted to one of...relief? He didn't know. The boy sheathed his weapons and nodded solemnly. ""I didn't think you could...you were always so kind...""

""Had to be me. Someone else might not have known.""

""I'm so sorry,"" she whispered. ""I needed to be stronger.""

""You've paid enough to be forgiven, I think.""

""Yeah...maybe..."" the girl fell forwards, and the boy named Alistair caught her in his arms, laying her against the bloodstained tile gently.

""I'm so sorry about Alex. If I'd known, I'd have found you.""

""I wouldn't have held back. I still thought this was a game...Alex...oh God, Alex.""

""Shush. It's okay now.""

""C-can you..."" the girl motioned towards her chest, and he nodded. Another blur of motion later, and he unsheathed a knife only to plunge it directly into her heart. The lights flickered and died. Shadows seemed to pour out of her chest and into the room. Her eyes fluttered shut, and she breathed a sigh of what sounded like relief. ""Thank you,"" she whispered.

When the lights came back on, the boy was alone. The girl, the seemingly endless blood that  flowed out of her, and the blade he had embedded in her chest was gone. He sniffed, wiped away a few tears, and stood, retrieving his milkshake before nodding to the employee.

""I know you want to know what just happened. You don't, not really. This isn't a life you want.""

Then he, too, strode out of the burger joint, leaving the employee alone with his thoughts

> Could you tell me, were you at all involved in the development of the Flutter plugin for VS Code (since I noticed they share the the same version numbers if I recall correctly), and if so, how?

I am; you'll note they also have the same publisher name - Dart Code - I'm publishing both :)

Right now, the Flutter plugin depends on the Dart one and doesn't actually contain its own functionality - we created it to help people who were searching for Flutter in the store find exactly what they thought they needed. In the future we might migrate some of the Flutter-specific functionality to it, but it's not decided yet. If we do, we'll do our best to avoid breaking people that only have Dart installed (eg. provide some hints if you open a Flutter project but only have Dart installed), but for now we're happy how things are :-)

> Did the Flutter team contact you, perhaps early on in the Flutter development process

I've had great help (both contributions and just assisting with issues/questions) from the Dart teams all the way since the start of the Dart plugin. [This issue](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/198) is where Flutter support started - it took me a while to get started, but obviously the help continued :-)

By some stroke of luck this led to a contract for me to work on Dart/Flutter tooling full time, so we're working even more closely now. Sometimes I work in `flutter_tools` and the Dart analysis server to support new features in the editor plugins (for example, the ""closing labels"", new code folding and emulator launching/creation all required me to do work in Dart/flutter before I could add them to the plugin).",2018-06-17 09:39:35
2540,"This. This was my feeling with HW's dilemma all along. His attraction to YJ was based on his head and his idea of who she is in his mind more so than who she was as a person. I think the fact that he remembered her, then saw their similar taste and YJ's stage in life made her seem like a suitable life partner. He had initially ruled HJ out as a partner based on her stage in life (he said his first impression of her was a cute student) and he probably felt there would be an age gap between them hence why he asked her if she's ever dated anyone his age. 

However, I think he came to realise that he enjoyed spending time with her, she made his heart flutter, there was definite attraction and she was probably more mature than her first impression let on (as displayed throughout the show). I think he tried very hard to stick with YJ but the cracks probably started appearing when he saw despite all his efforts, he kept hitting a wall and maybe saw glimpses of how YJ is actually like in a relationship and what he imagined she would be. At the end of the day, a month is not a long time and when we pick up on the initial sparks, it's really not based on deep knowledge of the other person so while there is attraction, once you know the other person better, whether you see yourself in a relationship with them can change.

2541,"> And again, I REALLY appreciated Hyunjoo this season; I always feel sad when I see bad comments about her (which ARE going to increase after this ending because -oh my god its her fault that hyunwoo didnt choose youngjoo-). I often read people saying 'Oh Hyunjoo only looks at Dogyun when it's convenient for her' but honestly I never saw it that way, it was more of Dogyun being able to make her see that he was there and he cared (the same thing Gyubin was doing for Youngjoo), this last episode re-enforced this opinion for me... the scene where Hyunjoo cried when she was talking with Dogyun. I felt like she really wanted to give him a chance but her heart was just with Hyunwoo no matter how much she tried, and she knew that Dogyun really liked her so she most likely felt upset about not being able to reciprocate someone who tried so hard for you (especially when you consider that at the beginning she was doing the same for hyunwoo).

As an Aquarius, I totally agree on many points here. I think for Aquarius, freedom and communication are very important. Both which I couldn't fully see in a relationship with YJ/HW but with HJ/HW. And I agree, as a viewer it was very tiring watching them. Any heart fluttering moment will be followed with unnecessary conflict and sadness. 

Again I was fully on board with HJ finding happiness whoever it was. Though I loved both HW and DG, I felt really invested in DG and seeing him grow and gain the courage to pursue HJ. From awkwardly hovering near her to asking her out on a date and telling her he didn't want it to be the last date. He is just too precious. With every little thing he did for her, I could tell that she was really wavering but like the panel said, the Sokcho date pretty much helped her realise how much she liked HW. If she had gone with GB instead, honestly she would've chosen DG. So... to be honest, I don't know if I'm truly happy with how this panned out because if the Final Date went well, HW/YJ shippers would be happy and leave HJ alone, and HJ/DG have a chance at a really sweet relationship. It would've been much more of a win-win situation. Ugh, when they showed DG giving HJ the book on Yayoi (artist?) that she mentioned, I just squealed at how perfect he was. And when he gave her back the book she gave him to ask him out, and when she was crying, I felt so sad for them and what could've been and I really wanted him to keep the book as a keepsake of what they had. Ugh. Damn it. The thing is, I see HJ as a good partner for HW. But I see DG as a good partner for HJ. ",2018-06-17 10:06:35
2542,I think she did make his heart flutter in many instances actually. He was stealing a lot of gazes her way and you could tell he felt nervous around her during their date. ,2018-06-17 10:12:34
2543,"Lyrics in English :
Sorrow, between your two lovely eyes, has made its nest
 
Night, in your black hair, has made its home
 
Your two dark eyes  are like my nights
 
The darkness of your two eyes  is like my sadness
 
When the tears come down my eyelashes: they turn to rain
 
A flood of sadness has overwhelmed my abode
 
When you stay with me, the wind carries away my loneliness
 
My two eyes have made it rain every night
 
Spring fluttered out of my hands and left
 
In my heart, an ice flower has sprouted
 
In my room, Im starting to burn from loneliness
 
Yet, in these times, theres a blossom
 
What should I sing? my youth is gone and so is my voice
 
In my heart, an ice flower has sprouted",2018-06-17 10:15:22
2544,"Explaining it to others is kind of addressing the extremes people see about it. The collapsing to the ground? Not everyone's got that.

I explain it like it's primarily a sleep disorder, both sides of the coin. Sleeping and not sleeping. Trouble in the regulation of it. Trouble staying awake, trouble falling asleep, trouble staying asleep.
  
The first thing that goes in motivation. You lose it. It's hard to want to go out and do things. Parallel to depression in that regard. 

Second thing that goes is your muscle might feel really tired. Leg pain or just a feeling like you've been running up stairs all day.  Went up a flight of stairs? Doesn't matter that you're in shape. All around weakness. 

Third thing. Just being background tired. Even with medicine, treatment, most of us will always sleep and wake up not feeling quite rested. Or maybe feeling rested a couple hours and then feeling like you haven't slept. Or feeling awesome, laughing at a funny joke and then crashing right after the emotional response. That part is rough because people don't see that struggle if your eyes don't flutter or you don't collapse asleep.

Sitting still and not being able to stretch is an issue. The body can't decide if it wants to move or relax. Too much relaxing hurts. Too much moving is tiring.  Sometimes even stretching all your muscles while sitting in a chair is enough to exaust you.  Flights can be tough, car rides can be tough, especially if driving and needing to focus. Activity like walking around the mall for a couple hours? ""I'm gonna go sit in the car awhile.""

I've always felt really sensitive to cold. When I had started taking Modafinil the first thing I noticed was my fingers didn't immediately get numb from the cold. Might be because it increases the blood pressure, also higher body temper is a known side effect. So add heat to that, the sun, the beach?  Issues. 

Part of fatigue that sets in is mental accuity. Trouble remembering words, having a word's definition in your mind but pausing in mid conversation trying to recall exactly what it is, even so far as starting to list the definition of the word in conversation. People can mistakenly believe you're slow or stupid or even on drugs.

Staying up late can be too easy because the most common and misunderstood side effect of Narcolepsy is the insomnia. People feel like you shouldn't have any trouble sleeping at all if you have narcolepsy. But the inability to fall asleep at appropriate times is nutty when you have to keep a work schedule or want to make plans for a day off.",2018-06-17 10:25:29
2545,"I didn't feel comfortable with *flakka* for a few reasons... firstly, because I can't find it in poetry. If I can't find a word in poetry, nor on a runestone, it means the word isn't attested until prose texts from the 12th or 13th century. It doesn't mean the word is wrong, but I obviously favour elder forms when I'm supposed to transcribe things into Runic Norse.

[When I searched for the etymology of *rakka*,](https://i.imgur.com/mtvN7ww.png) I found that Jan de Vries lists German *flackern*, *flattern*, Old English *flacor*, which isn't quite right, it's more like 'flicker' or 'flutter'. He also lists two side forms: *flkra* and *flkta*. The verb does seem to mean approximately 'to wander', but I can't find either of these forms in poetry. Worse yet, I don't know which of the three forms to apply.

So, basically, I think *reika* is more manageable. 

Translation of *reika* (from Johan Fritzner): 

* [*1) fare, fres frem og tilbage, hid og did, op og ned uden at stevne mod et vist Maal eller kunne komme til Ro*](https://i.imgur.com/3iil7Hi.png)

(To fare, to be lead forwards and back again, hither and thither, up and down without seeking a specific goal or being able to rest.)

* [*3) bevge sig med en vaklende Vilje, vre ubestemt; om Menneskets Sind, Sjl*](https://i.imgur.com/GBYB4Dz.png)

(To move with a wavering force of will, to be undecided; regarding the mind and soul of man.)

I also learned a bit more about the French Dub. While the other dubs are content with just voicing their respective characters, the French took it a step further and voice not only the background characters but also added grunts and shouts for their voiced characters where there wasn't meant to be voice overs. Take for example the Nerd when Sunset Shimmer chased him off. The nerd in other dubs were silent but the French one screamed. Just found that interesting

2557,"Awesome trip down memory lane. Had completely forgotten the likes of Alexander Popp and Alexandra Stevenson - big talents that never really delivered. Wimbledon through the 90s was a series of heartbreaks for me on the men's side; never did get to see my idol Becker win the trophy. My favourite women's player, Steffi Graf, eased the pain somewhat, although I don't think I've ever been more devastated by a sporting event than I was after that 1999 final when Davenport beat her. Great to see Paes/Bhupathi get a mention too - what a team they were, and what they could have achieved had they managed to put their personal animosity aside.

pd: every promotion period \[comeback\], new records are being set.

jin: Ah, thank you. These records arent being set by us but given to us by our fans. When we release music, our fans listen to it a lot and love it and let other people know about it. Its really thanks to our ARMY that these records could be set, we havent done anything \[to merit the records on their own\].

pd: youre promoting all over the world now

jin: for me, I think its really nice to be able to meet people who love our music, regardless of country. Truthfully, its not easy to meet people who like me \[oneself\], you know? Going to any country and getting to meet people who like me is really kind of happiness that you wouldnt think could exist in the world. Im \[were\] really blessed.

pd: V-ssi, promoting in Korea for the first time in awhile, if you could introduce your new song to us..

v: Im sorry but Im not someone who can introduce the song fluently or whatnot. Ill just say it simply looking back, I realized it was true love kind of im a bit sad, its a song like that that. You have to say it simply, I think its the easiest way for someone to understand.

pd: it sounds more honest

v: its been a long time since weve met, while promoting for DNA, over there \[points\]  during the early morning, just interviewing, sitting in a slumped state. After I saw that footage, oh Im really bloated \[from just having been sleeping\], I shouldnt interview in that state next time but Im exactly the same right now. Take lots of footage of Jin-hyung today, because hes very good looking.

Each time he messed up the choreography, weve decided to take one of these \[stitched on Jins jacket\] off. ARMY, please pray for him.

RM: It happens sometimes.. yesterday, we shot a CF but I had to wear shoes that were a bit too small and was over-enthusiastically running while wearing them so I think I hurt it then. It should be completely better by tomorrow. Of all times, today \[sigh\]

pd: what kind of song is this new one?

RM: Airplane 2 is a very exciting exciting song. Its an exciting song and we all groove to the rhythm with the subject brought over from Hobies mixtape, and made into Latin Pop. I think its a song youll really know \[understand\] in performance

Jin: In Airplane pt. 2 has the meaning of Ill sing where ever I may be. Theres a song called Airplane in J-hopes mixtape, you can think of this as a continuation. If you are curious, you can \[listen\] to J-hopes

JH: Ill sing where ever I may be its a song with that meaning?

pd: the member who matches the best with the songs?

jin: Id say, wouldnt it be Jimin who matches the best? Because he is really good at expressing himself on stage and hes a cool guy so he matches the best with Fake Love. And for Airplane Pt. 2, wouldnt it be all the members? Because we all fly on planes often

PD: looking at the lyrics, it says you guys have accumulated a lot of mileage

JK: True, because we go abroad often weve amassed a lot of miles

pD: how many times can you go around the globe?

JK: Maybe once? I dont know I dont know how many miles it takes to go around the world so..

I had no clue who this person was. He just ran around the corner and made a beeline straight for me. Naturally, I just froze where I stood. When I woke up this morning I never imagined that I would be accosted by a junkie in a lab coat with a body type of a heavyweight boxer. His biceps practically ripped out of his sleeves when he gripped my shoulders.

Look, wouldnt it be better to go to the police. That was all I could get out before the unexpected happened. He kissed me. On. The. Lips.

Keep it safe. They wont know you have it.

With that, he pushed himself past me and ducked down an alley. The last I saw of the strange man was his white lab coat fluttering behind him like some kind of cape. The clopping sounds of many footsteps grew louder from around the corner. A group of security people clad in their black uniforms burst forth from the corner like a mob of black Friday shoppers trying to get the best deals. I was once again nearly bowled over.

One of them stopped just enough to shout at me, You there! You see a crazy man in a lab coat around here.?

I just dumbly nodded and pointed down the alley he took. I was at an absolute loss for words. Little did I know just how much this encounter was going to change my life.

An hour or so after the strange encounter I was sitting at a table in a local sandwich shop when the change made itself known. As a voice that registered as if the person was sitting right next to me, but no one was there. I checked a couple times.

Hello, Carl. I looked once more. No one was there. Youre not going to see me. Im the latest advancement in artificial nanotechnology. I currently am residing in you.

The herald's call was answered by a guard atop the wall.

""Welcome, men of Yronwood! The Captain o' the Guard will be here shortly to escort you to the keep.""

The Leopard's Gate was already open, and soon five men in Vaith livery met the party at the sandstone structure. Their leader, a tall, handsome, dark-haired man with a clean-shaven face and dark eyes, raised a hand in salute. 

""Greetings, sers! I'm Ser Olyvar Briar, Captain of the Leopard's Guard. If you'd just follow me, I'll bring you to Lady Cassella."" Olyvar's voice carried a heavier accent than the other guards, though it seemed more polished, as though the man had received a nobles education.

The path from the gate to the keep was direct, broken only by a plaza with a bubbling fountain at its centre. Past the plaza, the street became long and straight, lined with palms and the occasional flowerbed or pond. At last, they arrived at Castle Vaith, the tall, pale keep standing proudly above the small town. Banners bearing the sigil of House Vaith hung from its walls, fluttering in the light breeze. Once within, they were led up two flights of staircases and down several hallways, eventually arriving at the end of a particularly well-decorated hall, a set of heavy, wooden doors occupying most of the far wall. The grand gates were decorated with ornate carvings of leopards prowling amongst sand dunes and bordered with a wavy pattern mimicking the River Vaith. They had been crafted of mahogany from the Summer Isles, choice details carefully gilded. The doors had been there as long as anyone could remember, but the dry air coming off the desert combined with generous lacquering and care from later generations ensured that the symbols of the Vaiths wealth were as vibrant and impressive as they had been when they were first commissioned.

Ser Olyvar grabbed one of the elaborate leopards head door knockers. The Bloodroyal, seeking an audience with Lady Cassella.

The shuffling of papers could be heard from within, followed by the voice of a clearly ageing woman, though it still carried the sense of authority it had in her youth.

Of course, Ser Olyvar. Let him in.

The doors swung open noiselessly, the product of the meticulous care Cassella ensured the servants paid to the hinges. Inside the solar, the Lady of the Red Dunes sat at a desk made from the same red mahogany as the doors, though it was notably less ornate. She wore a gown of simple orange silk, embroidered sparsely with lighter yellows.

Welcome to Vaith, Lord Alesander. My sincerest condolences about your late lady mother. We were never particularly close, but I admired her strength. Now, what brings you here?

2584,"Fastball->cut fastball->cutter->slider->curve
The best place to start is to think of a Continuum between a fastball and a curveball.  A fastball is thrown with maximum speed and less rotation that would cause lateral or downward movement.  A curve ball is thrown with minimum speed and maximum rotation for lateral and downward movement.  Roughly each step from fastball to curveball will reduce speed and lateral/downward movement.  This Continuum isn maliable: you may hear someone call a pitch a ""slurve"", ro instance. Also their is adjustment of angle of spin/rotation.  A Slider tends to move more laterally than a curve, for instance because the angle of axis of rotation is different.

Outside the continuum you have:
 Split finger fastball, which is a fastball thrown with wide index and middle fingers (as the name suggests) which takes significant speed and rotation off the fastball, making it an off speed pitch.,
Changeup: often thrown with Pinky and ring finger and middle finger.  The pitchers motion looks the same but it is slower and drops, not unlike the splitter.
Sinker: a fastball thrown hard but with lots of downward movement.   The pitch is intended to be a fastball with opposite rotation of a four-seam fastball. 
It doesn't actually ""sink"" as much as a curveball and is intended to induce groundballs.
Forkball: the ball is wedged between the index finger and the middle finger.  This pitch has very little rotation on it and acts similar to a knuckleball. This was the grandfather to the split-finger fastball, and the pictures are actually somewhat related and have similar effects, but the split finger fastball is more controllable and has been a much more popular/effective pitch.
Knuckleball: thrown with finger tips, rotates almost not at all (1/4 forward rotation is said to be optimal).  Flutters erratically in it's trajectory.  This pitch and the fork ball both induce an element of chaos/unpredictability into the result.
Screwball: opposite spin and movement of the curve.  Much harder to get this kind of spin because of arm mechanics and therefore generally doesn't have as much movement as a curve.  Not a common pitch.

There are a few others but I think I covered 90%ish.

With one hand he parted the crowd and beckoned them to one of the paths leading into the town from the plaza. The Xaskarians walked, surrounded by a growing crowd of curious onlookers. They went up a few sets of stairs to a lump of plastered buildings at the top of the town. From the jutting platform besides, there was a clear view of the entire valley. Wooden poles lashed with crimson banners fluttered in the wind. There was but one doorway at the top of some narrow stairs leading into the house, and it soon became cluttered with townspeople trying to cram inside. Ghorin worked, better shoved, his way inside and beckoned that the strangers sit. 

It was a small smoky room with a single window that projected a beam of light over the hearth set into the tiled floor. Every surface was smeared with plaster between wood beams. Small benches in the corners were made more comfortable by pillows and fibrous mats, of the same kind as in the market. Lamps hung from the ceiling, adding a oily glow that blended with the firelight emanating from the hearth. A cauldron was perched above the coals, simmering with some sort of stew. 

Their bakra left outside, attended by a entirely perplexed local servant assigned to the task, the Xaskarians tried to settle themselves in, though the benches were quite austere despite the cloth coverings. Two townsfolk passed from bench to bench with a bowl of steaming water. First Ghorin dipped his hands, washing them and letting the steam curl over his face, then it was passed to the Xaskarians. 

Ghorin, reclining in his own bench at the far end of the room, nibbled on some nuts from a dish that had been resting there, presumably from a mid-morning snack before they had arrived. 

""We are honored to have visitors from the great Sun [Elhas]. Rarely do foreigners come up these passes. On first glance, we believed you bandits!"" he smiled, ""but I now see myself mistaken.""

2613,"Beverley was content.

It had been a month and some weeks since she had last seen her parents  university was her priority right now. As a young, career-oriented woman in the world of business and law, this was to be expected. It was hard for her to find a break in the endless exams, tests and revision that swamped her schedule, but for a brief weekend shed worked overtime in order come stay in her childhood home.

The open door bumped slightly against her shoe. Bev had just begun to tie her second one before the familiar *pad pad pad* sounded from behind, followed by a high pitched Mrow!. A smile overcame her face, and she dropped the laces to spin and see the little tabby cat that had grown up alongside her all these years. 

Hey Fitz!, Bev chirped with glee and ruffled his head. Fitz - short for Fitzgerald to you  was roughly twelve years old with the spirit of a kit and purr of a chainsaw. Young at heart, as they say.

Bev resumed tying the knot but not without a struggle. I knew this would happen, she thought. Fitz had a habit of headbutting, albeit playfully, and did everything he could to tie himself within the train-track of her boot so as to not let her leave. A gravelly chuckle that matched his purr fell from Bevs mouth, and she almost jumped in surprise at the sound of another voice, And where do you think youre going, missus?.

Mama. Bev turned her head to see the woman herself standing there, arms crossed in an old dressing gown, usually short but now leering like some kind of Colossus. A face puckered like Fitzs ass was the cherry on top, most likely due to the open door letting out heat.

Just out to the neighbourhood, Mama. Its been ages since Ive walked around and refreshed my memories down here..

Out of her peripheral Bev saw her nod shortly.

Dont forget your scarf. Be back soon.

And with that, Mama turned tail to the kitchen, followed by the gentle *pad pad pad *of Fitz.

Bev grimaced and stood up. Conversations with her mother had never flowed, and she didnt expect that to change anytime soon.
She glanced up at the hangers and spotted a ratty woollen scarf. Bev hated wool. It was irritating and left red patches wherever it touched, particularly the neck, which in Bevs sector was most certainly not the time nor place to have questionable marks.

She reluctantly pulled it off the hanger and watched the dreaded thing fall limp in her hands. Even the touch made her throat gag, and with a swiftness of a child taking cough medicine Bev had the snake looped around her neck and stepped through the open door onto her parents deck. She shut it quickly behind her before her mother could shout.

There was a wonderful taste of pine in the midday air, simmering and sharp, causing Bev to switch on and forget about the itchy collar. She made her way down the steps, still dewy from the morning, taking in the familiar sights that werent visible at night-time when she had arrived and unpacked. In front of her was a road that she knew if you took right would lead to town, and left 

*The park!*

The memory jumped at her hard. Where had she spent all of her free time? It was but a brisk walk away that would take five minutes  no, two!

Bev had never felt such electricity before, such a strong pull to revisit this long-loved place. She quickly made her way down the steps and to the path. There was slide, a swing, and the wood-stuff that covered the ground - what was it, bark? Or maybe sand? More questions filled her with childlike joy, and although Bev knew that she would most certainly not being playing in it, there was no harm in seeing such a profound relic from her younger years.

The breeze urged her on, cooing and cooling her irritated neck.
On the way, she passed familiar trees that had been lining the roads since before she could remember. That stop sign that had been stolen too many times to count? Still standing. The graffiti that had once haunted an otherwise lovely house was now gone and the place had been transformed into a beautiful place that fluttered her heart. 

Finally, Beverley had reached the edge of the park, panting lightly. She pulled uncomfortably at the scarf until the realisation that her mother was nowhere to see and chided herself for her foolishness. 

The scarf was promptly whipped off.

There was a new fence around it. So dangerous - wooden and pointed arrows? Wouldnt it be safer to not have them there at all? There again, iron bars would resemble a jail cell. Perhaps this was best. She looked on, and  much to her delight confirmed that there was indeed sand, a swing and slide. When she was a child it had felt so much bigger than before  what had happened? 

*Youve grown up, Bev.*

Upon hearing their comment, I might respond, ""I've learned to enjoy the process of setting up the cooking process, such as dicing all the ingredients and placing all the dishes and pan on the counter so I can see them; then the rest flows through."" In this case, I have essentially offered a possible ethic. I cannot truly know if emphasizing the setup causes the whole process of cooking to be more enjoyable for anybody. But it is what I do, and it may help others enjoy cooking. I believe 00raiser01 is pointing out these 'looser' ethical statements: ""I dont ethically know, but here is what I do"".

I don't see Actionablethought disputing existence of 'looser' ethical expressions. Instead, I see that shared premises necessarily exist beneath ethical consideration. Let the above example about cooking be extended. If the person frustrated is anchored in a deep belief that cooking COULD be enjoyable, but something about it seems frustrating, then he or she is likely to accept my tip about enjoying the preparation part. However, if my enjoyment of cooking is contrasted by his or her contrastingly anchored belief, then there is no ethical conclusion to be had, and only whimsical flutters of opinion and character expressions substantiate the interaction.

2625,"I think what /u/Hamsterium was originally alluding to is the fact that irrelevant of how many of those foam ""bass traps"" you put in the corners, the only thing they're doing is absorbing high frequencies. If that's your goal, great, but broadband bass trapping requires more dense material (think rockwool) and with a lot more surface area and thickness to be effective.

I built my own for all my corners at 2ft wide by 8ft tall by 6"" thick and it still isn't completely effective in reducing bass buildup for small rooms (of which mine and yours are). The only thing your corner traps are doing is reducing flutter echo, so pretty much just performing the same job as your other panels.

It sucks, but companies that sell acoustic treatment products like that under the auspices of ""bass trapping"" are entirely (and scientifically provably) misleading.

You're still reducing the ""liveness"" of the space and that's probably what you're noticing as a difference, which is good, but it's irrelevant of controlling low end. Thus, your mixing decisions will be affected by those unaddressed environmental factors. If you'd like to determine how little those panels affect low end, get a measurement mic and one of the free acoustic measuring programs and test with the panels off and on. You'll only see reduced reverberation time in the highs and potentially the upper mids.

Anyway, I don't mean to rant but the sheer number of people's setups I see that have what is functionally equivalent to a Chiquita banana sticker in the corners of their room makes me feel like too many people are being taken advantage of, and I just want to encourage them to do some research on how sound behaves and how acoustic treatment works toward controlling that behavior.

""Well where does that leave me?"" I asked, still as much of a confused atheist as ever. She adjusted her files and continued explaining.
""The better a person you are, the shorter the respawn time. If you're not a good person, you're stuck in limbo for a while-"" ""So how did I do?""
""Overall good, questionable taste in pugs and lackluster enthusiasm for musical theatre but I'll let it slid-"" 
""Pugs are adorable and Broadway isn't even-"" 
""They've been bred to have breathing problems Jeremy. And musicals are great, Grease changed my after-life. But anyways, moving on to the paperwork.""
Before I could protest further, she pulled out a golden scroll titled 'Terms and Conditions of Respawning'.
It began: 'The ReSpawner must understand that although we make the transition as seamless as possible, we cannot ensure a time as speedy as the man, Big J. We try to stick to 5-7 business days for humans. We also cannot ensure the form in which you respawn""
I pondered the terms, and asked ""You're saying I could respawn as anything, like a rock?""
She responded curtly ""We try to stick to living things, like an algae or bug on that rock.""
I pondered some more, ""How did Jesus respawn as himself then? Isn't that unfair?""
She sighed loudly, ""He and his associates, the 3 kings, found a hidden legal loophole that we've since resolved. Jesus just so happens to be one lucky bastard.""
Her reply was funny enough to convince me. I signed the contract. Well, I didn't come back as myself. I didn't come back as rock algae. I didn't come back as the next billionaire.

2632,"""Love Potion. Doctors hate it! Experience the secret that experts don't want you to know about!"" I get a good chuckle out of that. I know a few of my friends would get a kick out of this and so I buy 5. I throw everything into my car and head to work, drinking an energy drink so I can get through this mess today.

During lunch, I go into my car and eat my lunch while jamming out. Work is pretty hard, but a normal busy day that gets me moving. I reach down for more chips while watching some guy who looks like he could be a thief and accidentally grab a bottle of love potion. I read the label: ""WARNING: Before consumption, make sure what you want to fall in love with is the first thing you see."" So this must be one of those ""love at first sight"" kinds of deals. Hmm... doesn't seem to last very long. Maybe a few hours worth? I could give this a try when I'm back home, but I already made a ton of plans. I take a step back and laugh at myself. Why am I taking this ""love potion"" so literally? I put it back in the bag and go head back in to finish my shift.

After work, I head over to my friend's house and hang out with him. I mention the love potion I bought and he laughs at me. ""Why in the hell would you buy that? Are you still trying to find love? Eh?"" and nudges my side. I sigh and am about to change subjects when some more of our friends stop by. One of them, a couple, were arguing on the way in and my friend whispers to me, ""They've been at it ever since we picked them up. This is so annoying"" and she ends this with a facepalm. I don't blame her though. At work, you hear all about people's love life problems and try to pick advice from you. Not my problem, not my job. I take a drink of my beer when my friend interrupts the arguing couple and says ""Hey! Why don't you talk to Ryozo over there! He knows how to fix your problems!"" Son of a- He's drunk and now I'm about to be thrown into a mess I don't want any part of.

All three of us step outside and I run to my car, grab two bottles, and hand them to the couple. They look at the cheap nature of the bottle, frown at me for even suggesting this stupid idea, and are about to go back inside when I stop them. ""Please. For my sake, just entertain the idea for a moment and we can talk this out. All three of us. Ok?""

They sigh and I explain how to do this to them. They reluctantly drink the whole bottle, slowly open their eyes at each other, and for the longest moments.... nothing. No reaction, no talking, nothing. I can hear the leaves drop and slowly flutter down and hit the ground. After a minute or two pass by, my friend stumbles out and yells out ""Wassupfuckers!"" and falls down. It snaps us all out of the trace, and the two, after seeing each other, start kissing each other, apologizing to the other for being stubborn, and they stay outside all night. I smile and walk back in, carrying my friend back inside.

The next day, the couple calls me and thanks me for saving their relationship, for making them see the truth and re-realizing their love for each other. I smile and realize that I have 3 bottles left. I go back to the dollar store to buy more, but they're gone. How did they sell out?! I rush all over the store, I demand more from the employees, but nope. All gone.

I go back inside and figure out how to use the last 3. Which friends are more worthy to use these on? As I'm thinking this over, I hear over the announcement that a car was broken into. I rush outside and yep. As fate's hand would have it, my car was broken into, and along with it, the love potions. Damnit! I kick the car in anger and from under the seat, the last bottle rolls out. I put this in my pocket and swear to safe guard it with my life. I go back inside and get back to work, thinking about how to use the last one.

After work, I go back home and check my phone. My friend, Caitlyn, who I have the biggest crush on in the world, messaged me and told me that she was coming in to town tomorrow and that we would be able to hang out with each other all day, on my day off. I'm so excited and realize that the universe gave me on chance at this. I take the bottle out and slowly rotate it in my hands. I'm going to give this to her, and we can be together like we always talked about.

I plan everything out: movie, dinner, maybe a little bowling or pool, and end the night with a toast of the love potion. I pick Caitlyn up and we go on our date. All throughout the night though, I'm constantly being called by someone, but I ignore all the calls. I don't want to mess this all up with her. We've waiting so long for this to happen. As we reach her aunt's house and I'm about to bring out the bottle, my brother comes racing from out of nowhere, stops short of my car, and tells me that there was an accident with my grandma and that she's in the hospital.

After getting to the hospital and seeing my grandma there, I break down and lose it. I can't stop crying and, even with Caitlyn there, I can't stop. The nurse brings us in and tells us we only have a few moments left. We all take turns saying out goodbyes and whatever. Caitlyn lightly squeezes my arm. ""Let's go"" she whispers as we walk in. I introduce Caitlyn to my grandma and we talk for a bit. Talk about wrestling, how my job is coming along, who Caitlyn is and that we were on a date. My grandma lightly squeezes Caitlyn's hand and tells her ""Take care of my boy. He's a crazy kid, but he's a good kid."" Everyone then comes in and I wipe away the tears and feel the bottle in my hand. As I pull it out, my grandma smiles and says ""Can I have that? The nurses here won't give me anything to drink."" I nod and give the potion to my grandma and she closes her eyes. I gather everyone together and she slowly opens her eyes again. With a heartfelt smile, and a tear running down her face, she motions me close and whispers in my ear. I laugh and cry at the same time as she flatlines. I hug her tightly and leave with Caitlyn.

When I get to Caitlyn's and walk her to the door, she asks ""What did your grandma say to you?""

I smile and say ""I didn't need that potion to love you all. And you don't need it to love her."" I give her a kiss goodnight and leave, driving around town with the biggest part of my heart now gone.",2018-06-17 22:19:05

2636,">-How would slightly high wow and flutter affect drums?

Wow and flutter is a fact of the 4 track cassette recorder, to avoid it you need to get an open reel with larger tape. However, if your machine is in good shape and you keep it on a flat surface and don't move it during recording it really shouldn't be an issue.


>-How well do drums survive bounces?

The quality of your recording won't change when bounced, the issue with a bounce is that there's no coming back from it, it's now one track and has to be worked like one track, so make sure you're happy before you bounce.


>-Would it be better to route everything differently through the mixer (ie: isolate other mics than the kick and snare)?


I think that would be better, you'll have a bit more control.



-Do any brands/types of tape have better response for the recording or bouncing stages?

No brand particularly, but use type II cassettes.

 
>The goal's to get as close to a professional sound as is possible. Any advice would help.


I love the portastudio 424, I have the MKI and I think that they're one of, if not the best, machine for home-recording, for people who don't want to spend thousands on professional level gear. That said, you won't get professional quality (I'm assuming that you mean a clear, sharp, hi-fi recording) recordings on it, even if you record in a studio and have a professional do your mix, because it's a cassette recorder, and the tape in a cassette is very small, there is very little space for your music to be physically recorded on. If you want high fidelity sound you need to record on larger tape. It will sound good, if you make good music and a good mix, but it will have an unmistakably lo-fi/DIY quality to it.

2643,"I know I've found true love for someone once in my life. And I've dated quite a few people that I had strong feelings for as well. It's been hard for me to determine what exactly love is, vs liking someone and wanting to feel loved. 

My first true love was in 3rd grade. I saw him from across the room, and knew instantly that I loved him. We dated for that year, I lost track of him for a bit after elementary school. In high school, I saw him again here and there, and my heart fluttered every time. We kind of dated for a bit after high school, and even years afterwards, just hearing his name would be enough to bring back these strong feelings. In all this time, even after years of not talking/seeing each other, we've always shared the same interests. It was rough coming to terms that I'm not the right partner for him, and I can never have him. But I truly love him enough that it actually makes me happy to know that he's got a girlfriend that he loves. Maybe in another universe he's actually my soulmate.

It's hard experiencing love so strong that it actually is ""at first sight"", and then trying to compare every other relationship to that. I know love will always feel different with different people but...I've never been so sure of my love for someone since him.

Since becoming ace/possibly aro, I don't experience even a sliver of these feelings anymore, and it doesn't bother me the least.

2653,"""A thick, large
tail with a gradual transition to the trunk necessitates a
lateral sexual position regardless of the presence of a single
phallus or paired hemipenes. Animals with flexible trunks
(e.g. lepidosaurs) engage in pronounced sideways bending
of the body and tail to bring their reproductive organs into
alignment and as such a long intromittant organ is not
required. However, animals with more rigid trunks (e.g.
crocodilians) can only copulate by means of either a
modified sexual position or a relatively long phallus.
During evolutionary history, changes in locomotion that
yield significant reductions in tail length result in a
corresponding modification of mating posture, with
copulation then possible with the male mounting the
female from behind as seen in both the chelonians and
avians. Both the paleognatha and chelonians compensate
for their having a rigid trunk by following a general trend towards greater phallus length. Avians lacking a phallus
overcome the rigid trunk in a variety of ways which
include the male fluttering in place to maintain his position
during copulation, a uropygium to allow for greater
manoeuvrability of the cloacal area and by employing
simultaneous eversion of the proctodeum of both genders
(after Frey 1995).""

After that, different biological distinctions between different types of dinosaurs require changes in position, and the existence of non-intromittent phalli and other structures requires different types of mating.

2656,"The distinction is not in the different countries right to enforce laws. **Its simply which people are human enough to be responsible for breaking laws, and which are sub-humans too stupid to be responsible for their own actions.** 

You see, white men are the superior human beings, according to Progressives. They are so intelligent, productive, and powerful that they are fully responsible for their lives, even factors that sane people would recognize are out of their control. So when Warmbier is tortured to death for stealing a poster, this was clearly all in his control, so he must have *wanted* to be tortured, and therefore deserves it. Besides, as a white man being tortured to death was without a doubt less painful and traumatizing than it would be for a lesser being. 

But non-white males, all those varying degrees of race and gender, are successively weaker and more animal-like the further you go. Having a Vagina or Brown skin is effectively like having a severe mental disability, which leaves them unable to take care of themselves or make decisions for themselves. So when a non-white makes plans to illegally cross into a sovereign country, knowing full well it's illegal, then spends weeks or months enacting this plan, while taking steps to avoid being caught, it's clearly not *their* decision. They cannot as ""darkies"" have really consented to their own choices, so it *must* have been some ""whities"" fault, because by definition there is literally no one else who could.

In short, there is no group more racist, more sexist, more bigoted, and more convinced of the supremacy of the White race, than the progressive left.

To veil the threat of terror  
And check the show of pride;

And work anothers gain

The hate of those ye guard

2661,"*Disclaimer: Im not any kind of published author, so there isnt any real reason to listen to me. I think about writing a lot, though, and every once in awhile get around to dabbling in it. I have a degree in English lit if that helps. One of these days Ill finish a damn novel.*

It depends a lot on what youre trying to do with it. The sentence above might be a decent way to try to sell someone on a short story or RPG module. Possibly a novel, if it focuses on said knights. Part of the problem, I think, is that theres rarely a need to actually sell someone on a world; instead you want to sell them on the novel or RPG or video game or whatever youre constructing the world to support. You sell them *Lord of the Rings*, not Middle Earth. 

Thats probably not super helpful for your current predicament, though, and frankly my example was a bad one for your specific use case. What youre trying to do is create a concrete image in your audiences mind that typifies your world in broad strokes. So we can expand the example a bit. Weve got a frontierwhich implies both wild and dangerous lands beyond as well as civilization before it. Weve got a king and knights. Weve got at least one ancient and powerful artifact out in the wilderness, and sufficient motivation for some of the best knights to risk life and limb trying to recover it. Lets say we have a kingdom on the verge of collapse, the light of civilization faltering and the chaos of raw nature creeping ever closer. Out in the wilds are remnants of the old civilizations, and if that power could be brought home perhaps the kingdom could be saved from darkness. (This isnt a terribly original concept, but it works as an example.)

So the key things we need to convey here are: medieval fantasy; collapsing civilization; and a desperate struggle to draw a glimmer of hope out of the vast, terrifying wilderness. How exactly you write that depends, as I said earlier, on what exactly youre trying to do. A novel blurb might read something like: In the twilight years of the kingdom, hope is a fluttering flame. But for the best and boldest of the kings knights, there is perhaps a distant glimmer on the horizon, beyond the maw of the wild. If they brave the tangled lands beyond the crumbling walls, can they find it? Could they bring it home? Or will they disappear into the trees forever? For something like a D&D campaign setting, I might go with: Few who venture into the wilderness return, but the need is desperate. As the kingdom fails, the citizens look to those braveor foolhardyenough to challenge the expanding darkness, in the hope that they can somehow find a way to rekindle the flame of civilization.

None of that is winning any awards, obviously, but I hope it gives you a clearer sense of what I mean.",2018-06-18 05:23:13

2667,"Yeah, cassettes were horrid even when new.  Getting two cassette decks with Dolby B or C to play the same tape the same way was nigh impossible.  Tapes were done with high-speed duplication at the factory leading to all kinds of interesting effects on the wow & flutter of the product.  I didn't stop buying vinyl until the early 90s due to the lousy quality of prerecorded cassettes.  I could make a MUCH better cassette from vinyl than I could get ready-made. Better dynamic range, better treble, sharper more defined bass, fewer/lower speed variations, the whole bit.   Advances in tape technology over the years helped, but never made it hold a candle to what LPs could reproduce.  I do not understand why anyone would have an affinity for that format any more than they would for the lowly 8-track.

But as for the vintage equipment thing, that's a different animal altogether. In the mid-late 1970s the Japanese companies got into a ""war"" with each other to make the biggest and baddest equipment their engineers could create.  We will never again see that level of craftsmanship at a reasonable price.  The Dollar-to-Yen ratio was very much in our favor at that time, so we also got it all at a discount.  Even the knobs on these things were sometimes solid turned aluminum that would give you a concussion if used as a weapon.  

The Federal Trade Commission had much different definitions of performance measurement for audio equipment back then, such as the definition of a watt (long-duration, continuous, full frequency white noise at a constant level with no variation, from both channels at once in the 1970s vs. today's measurement method of single-channel, single-frequency blip, barely milliseconds in duration). There were some creative measurement techniques used by audio manufacturers in the 1950s and 1960s so the FTC tried to clamp down on the misleading claims. Alas, our modern lobbyists have put an end to all that annoying truth-in-advertising regulation.  Today's advertised measurements defy the laws of physics such as ""800 watts per channel"" when the power supply has a tiny transformer fed by a 2 amp fuse.  You can't possibly stuff 800 watts worth of electrons through a 2A fuse and expect it to remain intact, even with tons of capacitance in the power supply.",2018-06-18 07:08:55
2668,"my feelings on YOTS so far



streaky was repetitive with lifeless verses catchy on the hook the first 3 times you hear it, after? you can forget it exists.


black paint was a little too muddy for my taste but i like the crashing cymbals over the throbbing, deep, dirty riffs. the synth solo two thirds or so through with ride muttering in the background was really cool and, complimented by the lyrics, mysterious. however, ride's screaming on this track (which i usually enjoy) got old fairly quick, possibly because his screams are getting so strained here they barely sound authentic anymore.


flies was cool. ride has a great varied performance, the fluttery, bouncing synth which plays before the hook has grown on me and is nice for a head bob. the screaming part is sick as hell, with ride weaving in and out of screams about repulsive shit over lumbering synths (all the lyrics on this are wonderfully repulsive.) the ending and intro to black paint is ominous and i love the use of self sampling (as if the past is coming back to haunt them.) the transition to black paint is possibly their best transition ever. only criticisms other than the one i mentioned are this track might be too short to deserve the many phases it has. they sneak in a new phase as soon as i start getting into the last one. the ideas aren't given enough time to develop, especially in the second verse, if you can call it that. but that didn't affect my enjoyment of this track as much as it might sound.


hahaha deftly weaves together many phases and flows each one to the next so they feel holistically connected, unlike flies. i just love it. and this track surprised me so much. the operatic undertones at some parts, the intro which is forboding in how it glitches through a build up (with self samples and some opera chick, again). the guitar riffs on this are super catchy and an interesting new sound, but there isn't a part of the track that's not catchy. ride's flow gets my head bobbing, with some parts i can really just roll to (like when he says ""rang-a-lang-lang or something along the lines? shout out to the goofy, funny lyrics.) finally, when the beat cuts out and ride says ""ownage, ownage, ownage... ,"" it sounds like i'm in a 2012 purgatory or something and i love it. only criticism is unnecessary and distracting record scratches, like fantany had said.


dilemma is pretty much the same as hahaha for my feelings. really catchy, good flow from ride, almost like singing which i enjoyed, in THIS context. it works with this style but i wouldn't want to hear ride singing as the future of dg. otherwise super catchy, love the guitar, and that hook has been stuck in my head for the last 2 days. also, sorry andrew, but that addition was distracting and didn't add much or anything to the track.


shitshow is sorta the hot head of yots, as i saw it described, but then it's also i break mirrors. it's gritty, super fast, unrelenting, ride is furious. the production draws from interview and steroids with the bald head girl scratchy synth returning and the moist sounding drums as i could best describe them returning from interview a at 1:10. also ride's a little spooky in the background at one point where it sounds like he's taunting the listener. it's all hype as hell. synth, percussion, heavy guitar riffs. everything works. only criticisms is the self sample on this one just felt like it was playing for nostalgia. it did absolutely nothing for me but make me go 'oh, yeah, dg had albums before this one, ha.' also, the girl saying ""it's a shitshow"" kinda has me torn. i like how it sounds with the song but it feels too blatant, like if ride said 'i'm a hot head', 'this bullet with move theough you like a fast particle', 'i'm mentally unstable ', etc. maybe that's a nitpick though.


overall i like the direction they seem to be heading in with psychedelic rock, occasional bouts of accessibility in the experimentation, some really unique synth leads (see flies and haha) and some humor / self referential ideas in the lyrics. ride's performances have been mixed but i'll take the good with the bad. i await the rest of the singles this album will be released as with cautious optimism...",2018-06-18 07:56:24

also u asked na before what all rules u broke:

1 u have been excessively trolling,

2 act against the interests of the sub, 

3 are from rindia promoting randia and trying to disparage the sub everywhere. you can equate that to paki isi work

4 I remember reading smwhere that war against sub is liable for ban. all you do is war, like death with 1000 cuts principle, asymetric warfare. that itself means you deserve insta ban

5 u dont contribute 1 iota here or else where to be considered 'maybe u r good user'.

u think u r reddit lawyer then go to that reddit lawyer sub na. y be here? - yes, there is no rule, but it is understood u r not trying to help so, are a threat by extension.

7 u were abusing saying this sub mod is worst mod and what not on ur sidebar in ur sub. I have pics. that itself deserves suspension for witch hunting.

8 before u compare this sub to fluttershy, be honest, are their crimes anywhere equal? apples and jupiter size shit man. u dare not compare them and make randian mod tyranny equal to minor issues here or anywhere on indiaverse.

9 from what i have seen by ur idea of rules if users move out of line one inch, its a huge problem - follow rules of fuck off. No country's constitution also runs like that you chuth. they have sense and evolve. if left to you no one should post anything and that is perfect sub. that in itself is acting against sub.

all you do is miserable loser drama man. you dont deserve to speak. 

i donno why these guys especially mods tolerate ur crp. anywhere else u wud be banned 100 times by now for ur shit.

2675,"It took me a while to figure out that I'm an ENFP after reading into the models because it's a better representation of when I'm not influenced by anxiety or depression; INFP might have been the second most frequent result I got from quizzes in the past where I based answers on my behavior.

I withdraw when depressed and can become relatively isolated for long stretches of time. It looks introverted and it's by conscious choice but I don't enjoy it in the same way that I think an introvert would. It feels necessary to avoid becoming overwhelmed, even if the feelings I have around people are mostly positive. I still love it when people try to contact me, but I think from the outside it must seem as though I'm busy or uninterested because I find ways to cut interactions short despite being high energy while they're around.

I'm very open and honest when talking about it if the other person asks or seems interested, but I would not show those emotions to others while going through them. It doesn't feel good to share in the moment knowing that the other person can't do much to help, and sometimes I really need to process the emotions fully before I can get through them, while having another person around can distract me to where I pay more attention to them than to myself.

Dealing with it is hard, for sure, but for suggestions - patience and acceptance helps *so much*, for the times we embarrass ourselves but aren't sure how to deal with it other than by saying, ""toodles!"" or something equally weird and fluttering away. Understanding that we can say we're going through some heavy stuff but might not look it, because we care about how you feel and end up presenting ourselves in a way that we think would make you feel better to be around us.

It helps them get to the next sleep cycle instead of fully waking. And if they do fully wake up then youve only gotten them up a few minutes before they would have anyways. Obviously this doesnt work for everyone but it did for me so just giving an option.

2686,"(cont.) It has become something of a pretournament tradition for former England players to suggest the solipsism of the millennial generation is to blame for the countrys failures at the international level. Earlier this month, Paul Ince, a former captain, suggested Southgate should erect a giant tent at Englands base near St. Petersburg and fill it with bar games: A similar facility, he said, helped pass the time at the 1998 World Cup in France. In World In Motion, an account of the 1990 World Cup, Terry Butcher remembered players bonding over practical jokes, card schools and illicit nightclub visits.

Such distractions would, doubtless, sound hopelessly antiquated to Alli and his peers. The first item he packed for Russia was his PlayStation; he and the squad have asked for several rooms to be equipped with those consoles at the training facility. He will maintain his presence on social media, too, though not posting lineups, obviously.

None of that should be read as an indication that the squad is detached and isolated, and lacking in spirit. Just the opposite. There is an openness to Alli, and to others on the English team, an understanding that there is no reason for a protective shield.

It is the same reason he agreed to be among the subjects of a documentary series, called Phenoms, on Fox Sports, which involved a series of interviews over the course of more than a year. In effect, Alli does not see any reason to hide away.

I am of this generation, he said. I know how much people want to have an insight into what were doing, and its great we can give that in such a way. I am more than happy to share stuff  Id want to see it as well. Even though Im there, and playing, I like to see what other people are doing, to comment, have a bit of a laugh with them.

As well as helping the country feel closer to the team, there is an added benefit to that approach. England has, for some time, played Goldilocks in its choice of a base for major tournaments: Some are deemed too remote, and therefore too boring; others are too central to a city, and therefore too distracting. Some are too luxurious, others too Spartan. The training facilitys shortcomings are always listed in the reasons for the latest failure at a tournament.

Increasingly, though, the players do not care: They are no longer sequestered away from their lives, anyway. You can still be with your mates, said Alli, even those who are not physically with you. You engage with them on social media, or having them on the headset while gaming.

That is not to say Alli is immune to or ignorant of the pressure, of course. He knows that playing for England means it is not just having one clubs fans judging you, its the whole country. He detects that there are some in England who seem to delight in the countrys shortcomings, people who want you to do badly.

But none of that has changed his memory, changed his feeling. That is what is different about this England team, what has started to win the countrys heart: This is a team that seems to enjoy playing for its nation, one wearing the shirt out of delight, rather than duty.

Youve got to enjoy our job, because theres not a better job, Alli said. Youre doing something you love. Its still a summers evening, the flags are still fluttering from cars, and the barbecues are out. Thats what Alli remembers.",2018-06-18 14:33:20

The whole lonely ice dragon who claims to shun the world concept is interesting to me. Her being a super powerful staple card is also nice. For alternatives, I think having an actual Dragon like Lindwurm would have been nice, but Filene was my first pick. So now we have a Transforming Human, a Demonic Dragon Rider, a Dragoon, and a Dragonnewt. Next time lets hope for an actual Dragon haha. 


Shadowcraft: Like many, I don't play Shadow much. No opinions either way. Luna and Morty are good enough for me.


Bloodcraft: Oh man, Medusa is here! The first of the three ""GBF"" leaders. As in they also showed up in GBF and are popular there too. Medusa was my first pick by far. I mean, the Spawn meta wasn't exactly a fun time to play in hahahaha. Hopefully we'll actually get some snek support but we'll see.


Heavencraft: MIRROR BLADES, DEPLOY! The second of the three Granblue Fantasy leaders. I'm not surprised to see Alexiel here despite her lack of use in the meta. Alexiel made a huge splash in Granblue from her overwhelming in game effects to her thicc thighs and fluttering skirt haha. My guess is that some of that popularity leaked over. In Granblue she both ATTACKS and PROTECTS really well. 

And FINALLY ORCHIS!!!!!!!!!!!!! I've already reiterated why and how much I love Orchis on multiple occasions. So I'll keep it simple. GREAT JOB ORCHIS!",2018-06-18 17:29:32

2717,"So I've recently done a test drive on a Cintiq Pro 16 and a Huion GT-191 (slightly smaller with no express keys). I ended up going with the Cintiq, but to answer your questions.

1. Touch functionality on the Cintiq sucks. I turn it off immediately. Much easier to zoom using Photoshop tools and the pen than it is to use the touch functionality which is wonky at best and unusable at worst (and it's at its worst a lot).
2. The adjustable stand for the Huion was one of the bright spots. It's wonderful. Having said that, I ordered an adjustable Kensington laptop stand and that works just fine for the Pro 16.
3. Depends on what kind of computer you're running. I'm on a Macbook Pro mid-2015 which means I'm on Displayport/Thunderbolt and not USB-C. I've been able to get the Pro 16 to run reliably at 4k, even with an external monitor connected, by purchasing a 4k ready DisplayPort cable on Amazon and running my external monitor through HDMI. It seems like having the Cintiq and an external monitor connected through DisplayPort pushes the Cintiq down to 2k for some reason.
4. I had a Cintiq 22HD in the past and the big issue was desk real estate. I don't have a huge desk and the Cintiq is secondary to my main job. Having that big honking thing on my desk was a pain and made it a pain to use. I'd imagine the Huion 21"" is going to be almost as big since it has the express keys as well. The thing I like about the Pro 16 is that it is small enough that I can slide it in and out when I need it and it isn't very obtrusive which is great since I'm not using it all the time.

Some other things to consider. Color calibration on the Huion was terrible. I dicked around with it for about a week and  the screen still had a very cool blueish tint to it. I ended up returning the unit. Not sure if I got a defective unit or if other people are just used to that color problem, but it was annoying. Especially when I could look up at my calibrated 27"" right above it and see the stark difference. That color issue is nonexistent with the Pro 16.

Think about whether you really need express keys. I keep a bluetooth keyboard near my Cintiq and have all the keyboard shortcuts available to me easily as opposed to having to decide which keys I want to program onto the side of a tablet. It's also more comfortable to have your hand down on the keyboard versus constantly up on the tablet imo.

The Huion 21"" is a 1080p monitor. The 19"" Huion I tried out still looked crisp enough at 1080, but when I tried out a Cintiq 22HD you could definitely see the pixels on a 1080 monitor at that size. Meanwhile the Cintiq Pro 16 looks beautiful and crisp at 2K and 4K.

The Cintiq is not without issues. There are some issues with light bleed and there is some weird dark fluttering lines issue when you move the pen to the bottom of the screen, but these are both things that you could get used to. I ultimately grabbed one off of eBay for a steep discount, but I wouldn't be willing to pay the sticker price for the 16 Pro given the issues it has right now. Even with those issues it's still the best out there though.",2018-06-18 18:25:29

Maybe I did something terribly wrong, maybe Cordova has gotten much better in the last year, but I will probably never touch it again.  Switched to React Native and it's been much better.

2734,"It might depend on the paddle. 

Technique paddles can be good, but the larger the paddle to more resistance you get and the greater the chance you can injure your shoulder. I have some agility paddles from finis and use them quite sparingly. I feel like lightning for 100y after I take them off though! 

I think other pool toys are fine, as long as you swim without them too. 

For instance, a snorkel is a great technique aid. Pair it with a pull buoy and band and you can focus 100% of your catch and pull. If you're a beginner still thrashing around, this can be a fantastic way to get a basic extension, high elbow, catch, pull, exit, recovery pattern going without having to also worry about rotation, breathing, kicking, and keeping your hips up. 

Then work on your breathing by dropping the snorkel as the stroke starts to feel natural. Once that feels normal, you can drop the pull buoy and flutter kick to keep your legs up. As you drop each toy, your overall stroke will get worse but not as bad as it was when beginning because you're a bit less overwhelmed. 

I wouldn't swim only with pool toys, but there's tremendous value in using them to get you to a point where you feel comfortable with your stroke and can start working more directly on technique and intervals. 

And competitive swimmers use them throughout their career AFAIK. ",2018-06-18 20:11:50

2749,"It's unlike both of them in a weird way. Mushrooms and LSD are inherently different from each other you notice when you take larger doses. Peyote is different in that way. I have taken it by us grinding the peyote buttons and putting them into capsules, eating fresh peyote buttons raw, dried ones and also tea that they had premade. Tea is by far the best route. It takes 20-30 capsules to 'get anywhere'. My first experience was the strongest one. I can describe it to you  :)

So I ate 24 capsules and drank two cups of tea. The way the math was set up with the tea, that was additionally 14 more buttons. The buttons were about the size of a plum. Pretty tiny.

I was with a bunch of interesting people. A group of 5 of my friends(us all being 20 somethings) and 7 others(age 40-60). Two being the coordinators. We are on a large property in the middle of nowhere in central Missouri. All of us sitting around a fire near a church building and a music stage building(they're a church, also hosted a music festival once.). We all state our intentions in a circle or are given the option to pass long as we think about what our intentions are for being there. 

As I am sitting there I start to see the visuals after a couple hours. Also one interesting thing about peyote is it makes everyone's voice notably deeper, think what whippets do. It also makes you incredibly nauseated(obviously, I mean there's a cactus in your stomach lol). The visuals are a little different than LSD, mushrooms. Tons of reds and yellows. I am used to tons of purples and greens as the main colors during night. 

We are all talking about farm stuff because half the people there live on farms. I never was so interested in goats. How the milk they produced smelled of their individual essence... xD I just remember laughing really hard at that moment and telling them that I love them because I never sat and talked about farm stuff like that for so long and actually learned a few cool things

After awhile it's creeping up on all of us. We all basically stop talking and it is just amazing. I kept going into DEEP states of thought. I couldn't tell if my eyes were opened or closed. Not because of intensity of visuals but because it was taking me on 'vision quests' unlike anything I've had happen on LSD/mushrooms. I saw a giant dragonfly that was 3 dimensional and made of visuals flutter over me and remembered most if not all memories I even have associated with dragonflies. I had to ask about that one and he lent me a book on animal totems. Even this deep in, I could STILL READ. So that's notable. lol usually a description of tripping that hard on LSD or mushrooms, you wouldn't be able to make your hand out in front of your face from intense visuals. It just was not like this.

I kept thinking of my problems, my intentions for eating it. And it essentially made me come to terms with all of them. If not forever then for that moment. And that was what I needed to see. That there WERE other points of view I could have. That the things I find important and bad were full of possibilities and were silly anyways(in a great way)

After this probably 3 hour process of quietness and therapy, we are seeing the same things. We are playing music out of a little green bullet type speaker. Sphongle. Lol generic but earlier we were having a drum circle and listening to traditional native american music. Was funny when my buddy was telling the coordinator [""This is tribal music that people can make in this era!""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYowY7tvBbY&t=465s)

The speaker was pumping blue energy out of it. It was going into peoples' ears. We all pointed it out, we could all see it and were pointing at how it was going into the peoples' who's ears were closer to the speaker faster and bigger I guess representing that they could hear it louder. I remember my buddy took the speaker and put it up to his ear, that made some sparks fly lol we could see everyone's 'auras'. This was insane. I'm not even crazy into this stuff but I was seeing it. We  all were. One girl looked straight evil. Super nice lady I think it was her white hair but she was spilling white energy out of her pores and it was making a puddle around her and combining with the red stuff that was just flowing out of her mouth and moving with her words like some sort of fluid that couldn't stop coming out. We all saw that too but didn't speak about it until we were back in the car leaving like ""Did you see the one lady??!?!""

Anyways so we are all talking about science and aliens and stuff at a point. Gnomes and fairies and what not(I think I brought it up with the hidden folk stuff because I had been reading some icelandic folklore earlier that day). We were all talking about how species of animals could exist that we wouldn't be able to comprehend or see unless they wanted us to see them. Then some weird crap happened. We could all hear what sounded like pitter-pattering of feet andwere talking about how the ""Gnomes were out tonight haha""

Awhile after this conversations, I sat up and had to go pee. So I walk into the forest where it is pitch black. I was scared of the dark because I could hear stuff moving around in there, see stuff moving around etc... So I walk deeper because I think that it's funny how there's nothing out there but I am scared anyways. I'm peeing and see a bunch of little sets of eyes and things running around swinging on the tree branches. Laughing at me and pointing.. Then I look at this boulder in the light of the fire. I had seen the boulder earlier and it was a boulder.. But now when I look at it, it is a full on gnome smoking a pipe and smiling at me. Laughing with a few sets of eyes in the dark around it. I wasn't scared.. I was like ""Hey man :) I can see you it's okay!"" and it winked at me. All big and cartoon like. It was pretty weird. 

I come back and a friend is gone peeing too. When he comes back he comes and sits next to me and says ""Yeah for sure man the gnomes are out tonight did you see anything in the woods?"" I did so we had a laugh and shared our experiences.

My friend wants to go on a walk so we start walking and he's talking about how the last time he took peyote he saw the universe creating itself. I look up at the stars and(you can see the yellow in the sky, the whole milky way is present there. No light pollution). My field of vision is slowly taken back to where my entire field of vision looks like a handheld gameboy screen in size. All the fractals that make up existence, the stars, the grass etc.. I see them all being crafted by these giant psychedelic wrenches or fractal paintbrushes outside of my field of vision. Whenever I would move my head around or look in a different direction, these tools would take apart my field of vision and recreate it. Blew my mind. Showed me that my consciousness creates reality. Or at least that my senses do. 

After awhile we went home.. Minds sufficiently blown. 

The whole experience taught me a ton of how the imagination works and is important in structuring belief as whatever you 'imagine' is 'real' if you 'believe it'. Very important connection I think and I wouldn't have made it like that had there not been peyote introduced. For instance, if I 'believe' that my problems are cured now, then I can make that into my own reality if I 'imagine that it is real'. And this is also a reason why I will not argue with religious people anymore. They believe in that religion. So it is true to them. There is no reason to tell them it doesn't make sense when in their reality it makes sense perfectly. Nothing too 'spiritual' happened this go, but I learned a TON about myself and how things work, but when I started doing ayahuasca(people there were talking about what it did for them and how it was much like peyote except way stronger and more intense/likely to be actually terrifying to a person), that's how I basically established spirituality and understood perfect love and compassion from a first hand religious experience.

2750,"INITIAL THOUGHTS AND REACTIONS

This will be divided into multiple posts. Im just going to do a read-through and talk about the issues as they appear, I hope you dont mind. Also, I did this critique using your first submission which was removed, so if youve changed it since then some of this might not apply. 

First, I just want to address a comment you made in your first submission.
> it didn't do as well as I thought it would.

I just want to say that unless you have a damn good reason to think its going to do well, then you should always expect it to not. Readers are critical SOBs well, either theyre critical, or they say I liked it and leave it at that. And the writing process has a way of getting writers way more excited about their own work than others would be. It also has a way of eventually crushing that excitement and turning it to a sobering realization that youre not as talented as you thought you were. Thats not an accusation towards you so much as a reflection on myself (and many others I have spoken to about it). I just think its best not to expect positive feedback. And even if your writing actually is good, someones still going to hate it.

Okay, time to rip the bandaid. I do not think your writing is good. I like neither your story nor the way you tell it. You are not about to read 3000 words worth of compliments. Sucks, I know, but here goes. 

READTHROUGH

First thing I noticed, thats a very silly title. If this is a comedy then maybe I can get behind it, but I definitely cant take it seriously.

You need to delete the first paragraph because you wrote it twice. Its not inspiring confidence that you looked over your work thoroughly, but Ill let it slide for now.

> Heres how it really happened.

This is a very weak first line. You could just delete it and not lose anything. For that matter, you could drop it into the first line of just about any other story, and it would work just as well (meaning equally not-well).

The first couple pages are hard, and I think readers are more likely to be more critical in the beginning of a story. A lot is expected from a beginning. You need to introduce your characters and setting, establish the situation, and hook the reader, and you need to do it while proving you can write well. There are other ways to go about it than doing ALL of this right off the bat, but when you accomplish none of this with your first sentence, youre off to a bad start.

I think you go overboard with the cursing right out of the gate. One well-placed curse here and there will deliver the characterization you seek better than just constantly cursing. It may be how this character would actually talk, but a story isnt like actual life its life with the boring parts taken out. Excessive cursing is boring. Furthermore you quickly lose the impact of the cursing, so you wont be able to use it effectively when a moment really calls for it.

> You never know what kind of creeps hang out on street corners at one a.m.-- actually, you do.  The rapey kind.  So, in summary, I was walking pretty fast.  

Look, Im not offended. I dont think Im real sensitive or PC or anything, but The rapey kind, just seems in poor taste, like your just throwing around the word rapey. Maybe its how this character thinks, but so far it just makes her seem terrible, like this is a characters thoughts who I genuinely do not want to see. If you do it in an interesting way, I can get behind a shitty, unsympathetic protagonist, but its tricky. I think as a general rule, just dont mention rape unless youre sure there is a good reason, especially this early in the story.  

> Luckily, though, I didnt run into any trouble, and better yet I got home just in time to see the beginning of a new Cops.

I think Luckily, though, is a bad start just flow-wise, and the beginning of this sentence up to trouble, is unnecessary. I assume there is no trouble unless you tell me about the trouble.

> I probably should have gone straight to bed but, like the piece of trash I am, I spent half an hour or so munching on stale Doritos in front of the TV instead.

Okay, so Im getting depressed shit-head from your protagonist so far. I think instead is unnecessary and hurts your flow.

> I must have drifted off, because I was suddenly awoken by some loud sound that I couldnt quite recall through my sleepy haze.

Suddenly is unneeded, I will assume being awoken is sudden. And by adding a pointless qualifier, it actually makes it feel less sudden. Which of these feels more immediate to you? I suddenly awoke, or I awoke.

And the end of this sentence is unneeded. You already called it some sound, which left me with no information about the sound EXCEPT that you dont recognize it. Your story needs a major trim-down. 

> The small triangle of the living room illuminated by the TVs flickering bluish light was an oasis in a dark house, as I was keeping the electric bill to a minimum by turning only one light on at a time

Your voice is too passive for me. You have a tendency to say I was (insert verb) instead of just using the verb. I was walking, I was suddenly awoken, I was keeping.

If you can reword it, these would be more concise and more powerful as I walked, I awoke, and I kept. Was is a weak verb, dont overuse it (this takes vigilance.)

> this hadnt been a problem until I thought I saw something move in the shadows of the hallway out of the corner of my eye.

More passive voice, and just ineffective sentence structure. It prevents me from delving into the story, it prevents me from being hooked.

corner of my eye is not the takeaway here, it should not be at the end of this sentence. If you could rewrite to something like In the shadows of the hallways, something moved. Then this could give me a holy-crap moment. But as it stands, your narrator seems to be hand-waving through this part, like she doesnt really care.  

> I curled back up on the couch and tried to catch up with the mayhem happening on the show as a rare breeze passed through the window, which I always left open at night so as to let the heat of the day escape.  

Its a bit of a run-on, and I dont see the point of explaining why he opens the window, especially considering its the most mundane possible explanation.

You follow this up with: 
> The nocturnal chill in the air that fluttered long hair across my face reminded me of how late it was, and as I settled in under my jacket turned blanket, I wondered not for the first time why I even had a bed if I was going to continue falling asleep on the damn couch.

Which is kind of another run-on. I think you need to break this section up, and/or cut it down. 

> An abrupt flash of ugly fluorescent light 

Ugly light? Is it ugly in some other way than being fluorescent? Does ugly add anything to the actual image here?

> crept quietly

Redundant adverb.

> ""Why the fuck is she going in there?"" you might be wondering, in which case I'd tell you to shut your face because I'm telling the story here.

I would italicize internal dialogue because I initially take it as regular dialogue. More importantly, breaking the 4th wall to deliver an unfunny joke is a major turn off. If this is satire, I would introduce the 4th wall breaks with the best line you can. Its going to be jarring to the reader either way, so it better be damn funny,. Being snarky does not count as a good joke. If this is not satire, then please drop that shit, as you are just taking me out of the scene.

This is immediately followed with: 

> Besides, it could always have been one of the neighborhood cats sneaking in to fuck with me again.

Besides? Besides what? It doesnt make sense referring to your previous 4th-wall-breaking sentence, and it doesnt make sense referring the sentence before that, so I dont think youre using it right.
> When I saw nothing out of the ordinary, I headed for the light switch across the room, next to the back door (which was not only locked, but permanently stuck to its frame due to a shitty paint job).

I think youre using more passive voice here by opening with When. And you use parenthesis without a reason. Why not make that its own sentence? And Im expecting the back door bit to be relevant to the story, because otherwise it would be an unnecessary explanation.

> I was halfway there when a sharp whistle zipped past my ear. 

More passive voice, more unneeded words. Just show me what your protagonist does, stop opening sentences with words that add nothing. Try a more active voice: I headed for the light-switch. Or A sharp whistle zipped past my ear. Do I really need five extra words just to know that youre halfway there?

And does a whistle zip past an ear? That makes it sound like you wouldnt hear it. And arent whistles sharp by definition? Or do you mean, like, stacatto?

2751,"Arianne dreamed that she was a bird, perched on the windowsill of her bedchamber. She could see herself through the window, playing cross-legged on the floor beside Aemon with their dolls, and everything seemed lovely until she turned her beak toward the path below her. Gerold walked along it, flanked by two Ashford guards with their faces shrouded in shadow, and the merchant dragged his son behind him on a chain. Lucas was bloody from scraping along the floor, but his father showed him no mercy and instead continued pulling him along.

""We'll just take the girl,"" he said gruffly to his men, in that awful tone that he had which made it seem impossible that he might be wrong, and fear clutched Ari's heart as she watched him disappear under a stone archway beneath her windowsill. She fluttered against the glass in warning, but inside the room she could see herself smiling and kissing Aemon without paying any attention to the commotion outside. In her dream she panicked, desperate to warn herself and run away from Gerold, but it was futile as she saw the door handle turn downwards.

A _creak_ woke her from the nightmare, and the Ashford girl was frozen in fear; she had asked Jack to make the floorboard in front of her door squeak when stepped on, and before he had done that she had been entirely unable to sleep. It was meant to be a warning that would wake her if someone like Gerold ever came to take her again, but her plan hadn't extended so far as to say what she should do if her alarm sounded. Instead she trembled in her bed, praying for him to go away and leave her safely alone, and when she felt a weight thrown over her she inhaled deeply to gather her breath for a loud scream - she wouldn't be taken again.

She let the breath out quietly at the sound of her friend's voice, and her head spun with the speed at which her abject terror became delighted affection. Ari felt sick for a moment, but then Aemon crawled in behind her and despite her thumping heart she could not help but smile at his closeness as she turned to face him. ""You _came_!"" she exclaimed softly, careful not to wake Amelia, and she welcomed him into her bed with open arms that curled behind his back. His fingers drifted through her hair until they reached the back of her head and began to lightly scratch there, and Ari let out a soft _oh_ of please as she cuddled closer to her love.

""I love you,"" she said with a broad grin after they had kissed, and she did not know whether she was more happy that he had sneaked into her bed like she'd asked, or more relieved that he had rescued her from the nightmare. ""My husband, of my heart,"" she replied happily, ""my gentle knight, my beautiful friend."" She held him tight, snuggling into the warmth and security of his embrace, and Ari placed a kiss of her own on his cheek. ""Thank you,"" she whispered, truly grateful for how wonderful he was. ""You're the _best_, Aemon.""",2018-06-18 23:23:01

However I did some research and discovered that a potassium deficiency could be causing the mood changes and flutters in my chest that mimicked anxiety and put me into that panicked state. Ive been taking a multivitamin and some supplements for the last few weeks now and feel significantly better and more stable! Id say keep at it and know its just your body chemistry and use your best coping mechanisms to stay calm; perhaps research what you may be lacking in your diet and compensate through supplements!

Behind her, a towering mass of incomprehensible body parts writhed in confusion. *What?* it snarled, *what is this?*

The child carefully cradled the tiny animal in her hands, and turned to the grotesque beast. P-please, she begged, can you help my friend? I-I cant get him to wake up.

The monster bent down, and looked the girl in her eyes. *Very strange indeed,* it puzzled. *A grown woman who turns into a scared child when her little pet dies. Arent we supposed to be fighting?*

A shriek of anguish echoed across the cathedral, and the star-spangled man looked up only to see a bolt of blue and a flash of silver, before his collarbone was cleaved in two by the Ohmu-shell sword. He staggered back, his left arm hanging limp. 

Ahah, he said, fighting to catch his breath, youve finally come to your--

Nausica lunged at him again, pointing her blade directly at the star on his chest, her eyes burning with rage. He knocked the sword away with his arm, but she swung around again, and slashed deep into his side. He flung his fist back at her in desperation, but his wounds had begun to weigh on him. She ducked beneath his swing, and with a scream, she put a hand on her blade and lunged up with all her might to drive its point deep beneath his sternum.

The man in blue let out a wheezing gasp as the last breath left his lungs. In a final attack of desperation, he grasped at Nausicas head while his grip was still strong, knowing it would not remain so for much longer. She looked up through his fingers with a beastial grimace, and drew the ceramic shortsword from her belt. With a final shout, she lifted her arm and plunged the blade deep into his temple.

2758,"[Indeed, the Tekaarhii don't use gendered titles. Their word for Lord is *Soox'rhii*, which just means ""great person"".]

Vytasuu, a short, round-faced man dressed lavishly, with an orange cape fluttering in the wind behind him, spied the two Araneans from a distance, and his heart leapt. This was the first time they'd set foot in a Tekaarhii market. And he had his orders. His master wanted that silk. He'd been humiliated when Le'hyneeloo flounced into the capital with wagonloads of it and turned all the heads.

These spiders surely had more silk to sell, and he needed to get to them before anyone else did. Lord Vagawaga would most assuredly reward him.

***********************

Meanwhile, in the basement of the temple, things were already getting lively. The room was appointed with ten long rectangular tables in rows, and another ten smaller circular tables arching along the outside. By this point about half the tables were full. There were plenty of priests of Vikymii, in their regular red and black, but other travellers as well.

At the back was a long stone counter, behind which were shelves lined with ceramic jugs. A young priest bounced nervously around back there, pouring spirit for the customers. He frequently glanced toward the end of the bar for validation.

At the end of the bar, in a semi-enclosed booth, sat Hanax'a, watching the young priest closely. Occasionally he would have to chime in and remind him of something, or jump up to stop him from pouring the wrong spirit. But mostly things were pleasant. And next to Hanax'a was Jjenika.

Their two children bounced between them, small bundles of colour. Le'hymii wore orange, while X'vaala wore cyan. At six months old, the two babies looked identical, except for their eyes. Both of them had anomalous eyes for Tekaarhii. Le'hymii's were deep red, an X'vaala's were deep blue.

The two priests looked up as Frehya and Klie entered. Jjenika's face lit up and she waved them over.",2018-06-19 00:33:18

You can also go cross platform.  Google has Flutter, and there's React Native.  Cross platform allows you to have one set of code that runs on both platforms.  Microsoft has a C# solution as well and C# is great for other things like a backend.

Teto, she whimpered. Teto, please wake up

Behind her, a towering mass of incomprehensible body parts writhed in confusion. *What?* it snarled, *what is this?*

The child carefully cradled the tiny animal in her hands, and turned to the grotesque beast. P-please, she begged, can you help my friend? I-I cant get him to wake up.

The monster bent down, and looked the girl in her eyes. *Very strange indeed,* it puzzled. *A grown woman who turns into a scared child when her little pet dies. Arent we supposed to be fighting?*

Please! the child heaved. Please help him! I dont want him to die!

*And I couldnt care less. That creature is useless to me. Let it die so we can get back to our business.*

Tears welled up in the little girls eyes as the writhing beast turned away, and began searching for a way out of the void.

Y-you she stammered.

*What about me?*

Y-youd let my friend die

*Yes, and?*

Just to get to me

*People will do that, sweetheart.*

A shriek of anguish echoed across the cathedral, and the star-spangled man looked up only to see a bolt of blue and a flash of silver, before his collarbone was cleaved in two by the Ohmu-shell sword. He staggered back, his left arm hanging limp.

Ahah, he said, fighting to catch his breath, youve finally come to your--

Nausica lunged at him again, pointing her blade directly at the star on his chest, her eyes burning with rage. He knocked the sword away with his arm, but she swung around again, and slashed deep into his side. He flung his fist back at her in desperation, but his wounds had begun to weigh on him. She ducked beneath his swing, and with a scream, she put a hand on her blade and lunged up with all her might to drive its point deep beneath his sternum.

The man in blue let out a wheezing gasp as the last breath left his lungs. In a final attack of desperation, he grasped at Nausicas head while his grip was still strong, knowing it would not remain so for much longer. She looked up through his fingers with a beastial grimace, and drew the ceramic shortsword from her belt. With a final shout, she lifted her arm and plunged the blade deep into his temple.

He gave a sharp jerk, and stopped moving. His hand slowly fell away from Nausicas face, and she stumbled back, shoulders heaving. As the strength began to drain from her body, her anger turned to horror.

She had killed him.

As her eyes cleared, they fell to the still, gray gaze of the man in blue. The sterile air of the cathedral seemed to grow thin.

She turned away, clawing at her hair. *Focus, Nausica, focus!*

*Teto!*

Shaking herself, she ran over to where he tiny orange animal lay.

Teto, wake up, please! She begged the creature, cupping its body in her blood-smeared hands. *Dont leave me alone here!*

She put a finger over the creatures chest, hoping to feel something, anything. Sitting very still, doing everything she could not to move, she felt the faintest flutter of a heartbeat, and finally, she allowed herself to cry.

Teto!

There was a clatter of metal and ceramic behind her, and she felt the presence of the beast looming.",2018-06-19 01:52:18

I'm in Hong Kong for the month and have been casually keeping an eye out for smaller, less upmarket watch shops. I recently lost my daily beater and decided I wanted to pick up a Seiko to replace it. I am a tailor and I work with my hands extensively, brushing up against metal often, so as much as I'd love to wear a used Rolex Datejust or something of that ilk I think budget watches suit my life better.

I was buying some Indian groceries on the 2nd level of Chungking Mansions when I came across this tiny watch shop called Imran's. Now, I know this building gets a lot of hate and has a dodgy past, but I've been coming there for years (eating, buying spices, hell at one point I was looking into renting a space there), have had many happy clean stays in its guesthouses, and have watched it slowly gentrify (sorry, I mean 'renovate') into a very PG place with loads of legitimate businesses. It gets patrolled often and gone are the fakes of the 80's or 90's. At least, they're not displayed in shop storefronts (if you want fakes you just have to wait long enough at the entrance for men to approach you offering fake bags, watches, hash, hookers, etc). Since I was a little kid I have been visiting Tsim Sha Tsui and this building in particular has a lot of sentimental value to me...when I realized I could get my new watch there it made me really happy.

Imran was very nice and patient as I tried on multiple watches. I thought I would just get my usual silver bracelet band, dark dial style but then I saw this gold in the corner of the case and my heart went aflutter. It's kind of tacky. I kind of love it. It's perfect. I know a lot of people hate on the gold but I'm usually tan and the jewelry I wear (I'm a girl) is mostly gold. So for me, it works. Which is what matters, really. Imran's prices were pretty good and it was hard to resist buying more than one. Him and his father have been immigrated to Hong Kong in the 60's and have been in the watch business since then. We talked about politics while he adjusted my band and showed me how to do it myself.

I took these photos this morning after rolling out of bed (not at Chungking Mansions lol) so the watch is a little smudgy and I'm still figuring out how to use my camera. Second pic is looking extra bling because I tried using flash. Thanks for reading and I hope you all enjoy the story and the pics!",2018-06-19 02:27:45

>so Henry Lee said DNA doesn't matter 50% of the time. so?

What do you mean, ""so?"" Chances are better than even this case falls into that category. And bear in mind: he said that at a time when analysis couldn't be performed reliably unless the sample was fresh and fairly good-sized. In this era of technology that can detect DNA so small it can't even be seen, the ratio becomes even less than 50%. And that's not me saying it, either. An FBI criminologist was interviewed about this case during the JMK hoopla, and she said the exact same thing: the more sensitive DNA detection and testing methods get, the more irrelevant DNA is going to be found.

>...and the DNA that might just be the skeleton key to everything was slight and degraded. again, so what?

Are you joking? For one thing, if this had been a legitimate murder, especially a sexual one, there would have been tons more DNA left than just these submicroscopic specks. Which were so old, they were broken down.

>let's try out this metaphor: there's been a multi-million-dollar lottery drawing...no one has come forward with the winning numbers...one day you see the edge of a crisp, clean ticket fluttering under a rock in an alley outside a 7 Eleven: do you pick it up just in case--or leave it because ""eh...what are the odds?"" 

That's exactly the mindset that has kept this case cold for 21 years. Criminal investigations are not lottery drawings.

>the thing is, all that so-called inside-job evidence--which, need we point out again, itself never could, never did, and never will be enough to win a case

Please. Plenty of criminals have gone to prison on less than what we have here.

>would fall into a tiny pile of ashes in the face of a DNA match.

Except there hasn't *been* a DNA match. And there most likely never will be. Which leaves all the inside-job evidence on the table.

>look, even grand jurors who voted to indict acknowledged that there just wasn't enough evidence to convict either Ramsey beyond a reasonable doubt! 

That's an entirely different issue.

>...and certainly if that DNA were found to match anyone other than a Chinese factory worker, we could put our bottom dollar on the fact that that guy would be on the next flight to Colorado in handcuffs...and, more than likely, would get a life sentence even if not one other piece of evidence were shown!

Ive taken Xifaxan 4 times over the last 2 years.

2784,"Initially I was a part of those who wished to see Judge Persky be recalled. Not out of any sense of right or wrong just because it would shake things up. The world is incredibly dull. Why bother interacting with it if any of those interactions lead to nothing at all? I remained this way until I saw a picture of Judge Persky holding a No to the recall sign. Something about that picture broke the rabble rouser in me and now I think I can see clearer.

The basic details of this case boil down to Brock Turner and Emily Doe drinking heavily at a party, Brock took advantage (technically did not rape the victim per California's definition of rape at the time), and had to be restrained by two graduate students. He was convicted of 3 felonies. Probation officers met with advocates for Brock as well as for Emily Doe. They submitted a report to Judge Persky recommending that he be imprisoned for 6 months, be on probation for 3 years, and been registered for a sex offender for life. Brock Turner served 3 months in jail before being released on good behavior and has since lived the life of a recluse at his parents house in Ohio. That is what I know of the details of this case.

First off I would like to congratulate Emily Doe and Professor Dauber on:

1. Making a change in the world. This is a very rare feeling and when it comes should be enjoyed.
2. Sticking it to the legal profession. A profession that by its arcane workings and logics excludes every other citizen from its folds. And if a citizen wants to participate they must pay for the priviledge by spending >100,000 dollars and slaving through 3 years of law school.
3. Making sentencing more equitable by having white people get wrecked in court as much as minorities. The prison system could use more vanilla wallpaper.

The most important is numero uno. Just like those who have voted for Trump they can believe they have stuck it to the system. Just like those who voted for Trump I fear they may not understand what they went for.

It is plain to see why it feels like Brock Turner and Judge Persky were getting away with rape. It didn't help that Brock Turners parents made mistakes in pleading for their son. Their mistake was that they didn't undergo PR traininga before writing those statements. What? Parents trying to salvage some aspect of the life they had dreamed for their son? The nerve?! And not to address the victim?! The NERVE! Parents who are in so much fear for the life of their son and who maybe didn't realize that they even could address the victim? My Allah!

This argument against the parents is preposterous. There is no solid foundation for it besides that of someone on the sidelines looking to score a cheap point on a families devastation. Parents are supposed to try and salvage their child's life when it becomes broken. It is a cultural, sociological, and biological nonstarter to say that Brock's parents should have just let their child flutter in the judicial wind. Brock's father gets the most flack for his ""20 minutes"" line. He gets labeled as a part of rape culture. Oh sorry that he didn't have that sweet PR training and made a tone deaf argument. He was just trying to save some sort of future for his son. A future that was effectively destroyed by the people of California and Judge Aaron Persky. Not by sentencing him to 6 months, 2 years, or hell 14 years. They have destroyed his life by placing on his head the label of sex offender. 

I do not understand why people think he got off light? Is it just because they do not understand what the term sex offender carries? Brock Turner's envisioned life and goals are over. He will never have any sort of employment in the medical, educational, or defense industries. Any job that requires a background check (which is basically all of them) will immediately screen him out if his now infamous name hasn't done that already.  This is a tag that will last for his entire life barring some sign of mercy from the people of the United States and/or California (and looking at how they recalled Judge Aaron Persky there seems to be no room for mercy in California right now). 

Alas Judge Persky is now gone. Thems the breaks in a democratic society. I now have a challenge for the minorities and their supporters reading this. You must now stay more vigilant on the sentences that will handed down. If you won in this recall election enjoy but make no mistake that the repercussions will be falling on your minority communities. Professor Dauber makes this great argument that you can get both. Remove Judge Persky and not lose a step in the battle against mass incarcertion. With a nod to her extraordinary achievements Professor Dauber is a complete idiot here. No judge would have picked a different sentence than Judge Persky. All of them are now on notice that if they aren't throwing the book at everyone then they could be accused of being lenient and a part of the good ol' boys club. If you are a minority then stay vigilant out there because the courts are not going to be your friend. And if you think you will find mercy in the federal courts look who is in charge. Attorney General Jeff Fuckin' Sessions will be your daddy there. Gooddddd luuuucckkkkk!

So thats the end of this rant. I am not a fortune teller but I tend to agree with those that think overall this is a step back. There may be some increased sentences for whites but at the cost of sending more blacks and browns to prison for longer time. Professor Dauber and Emily Doe get to claim they struck a blow against the good ol' boys club but from my point of view they did it by sacrificing an innocent judge. I hope that sacrifice turns out well. And  I can feel glad that Judge Persky most likely will be fine. He is still respected in the legal community and I hear his wife is also pretty well off. As for Professor Dauber you can count me out of any battles she fights. Professor Dauber is not evil. I believe that she has good intentions and wants to make society better. But from this process it is clear that she has no qualms about the journey she takes to get their. If you are standing in the way of what she thinks is the righteous path then homie you are getting fucking bowled over regardless of how innocent you are. Thems the breaks dawg!

4. Now, pack on the shade expensive from, again, the same palette all over your lid. Spray your brush with setting spray to make it more intense. 

5. Go back in the crease with the shade violence to blend the lid color to the crease. 

6. Pack on the liquid eyeshadow into the blue from Stila on your lid where the precious blue shade was placed. 

7. Add the shade vanity in your outer V of your eyelid. 

8. Line your eyes with your favorite black felt tip liner. 

9. Add your favorite lashes! Flutter lashes are always my choice.

2798,"The Magic Age started with violence. Unsurprising really, given mankind's penchant for aggression. In the wake of that, an international agency was formed to keep control of the populace. The Order of Chaos, they called themselves. I'd love to know who thought that name was a good idea. Humanity, remarkably adaptable as it is, settled into it's suddenly changed world easily and it wasn't long before The Order was introducing laws to govern the use of runes across their classes. Common Class covered the runes used for day-to-day use at home, school and work. These runes changed the way mineral mining was done, the arts in their various forms suddenly blossomed from weeds to sunflowers, magnificent in a way that had been previously unimagined. Specialist Class runes took years of study and effort to master, quickly becoming an exclusive trait of the rich and talented. Criminal Class runes are, as the name implies, illegal to use. Locating an individual's jewellery or wallet could be done as easily as scribbling a rune upon your brow. Anyone caught using or even wearing a Criminal Class rune was brought before the Tribunal. That never ended well. And then there was Master Class, the runes capable of changing the form of living creatures or the earth herself. These were tightly controlled and required a licence for use or you faced criminal proceedings. More like a kangaroo court. If you faced the tribunal, you were as good as gone. Those who went in, came back out like zombies, some vital part of them missing. 95&#37; of them committed suicide with the first 30 days after.

The Voider, primary enforcer of The Order of Chaos, was an unimposing woman. Average height and shapely, she had blonde hair that curled invitingly at her shoulders and a smile that could charm an Inuit into buying ice. My eyes traced over her repeatedly as she approached,  her lively green eyes sparkled. She was wearing a 3 piece suit and kitten heels. Watching her walk in those heels was mesmerising. My wife truly was a beautiful woman and though I should have been scared of The Voider, I simply couldn't manage it. I felt a brief spark of guilt flutter in my belly and warming my cheeks. I'd dedicated my life to studying and understanding the runes, forever looking to make my own mark on the world. This hadn't been how I'd imagined it though. 

""Robert Harper, you've been summoned before the Tribunal for crimes against humanity, now and forever more. What is you plea?"" I should have hung my head in shame, I should have spouted a thousand and one apologies but all I could do was look into those beautiful green eyes as something else spilled from my mouth instead. ""Guilty"" I breathed. I'd known from the moment I carved that tantalizing symbol into my skin, that I could never take back what I'd done. I barely listened as the Tribunal called upon The Voider. She slunk forward like a cat stalking a canary and I fixed my eyes to the beauty mark on her left cheek. The only way I had ever been able to tell that the woman in front of me was not my beloved Edie. I closed my eyes to avoid seeing what my sister-in-law would do to me.

2808," They Call Him The Cordial Man. He was kind, tenderhearted and warm. His voice had a soothing meter, bright eyed and very keen. All his conversations were interesting, educational in a way that made you feel all the more clever for having taken the time out of your day to sit beside him and converse. 

 They call him the cordial man because he had a sweet tooth, would sit in the pub in the late afternoon with his jacket and tie and dog at his feet. He belonged to the pub like a child to its mother, in a comforting way that was also a bit aged. He was quite old for it -the sitting on wooden chairs and arms resting along the tabletop. On Mondays he would sometimes talk about his weekend, the garden and mass and the quiet quite lovely time he had, alone. Yet for all that he was pleased - chuffed - to have a chat during the week. Not a bother, he would say, but if you don't mind yourself why not sit for a bit; you'll get to talking, him and you, in the dim open room with the smell of floor wax and lacquered wood. With the dimness and the silence and the long, low empty room there was little in the way of time. There was little in the way of much of anything at all. Just the long slow slide from word to word string like beads on a thread. It was a sort of meandering thing, to meet this man. He would talk and by it walk you though thing that were fantastic in that they were mundane but embodied with a life that was somehow still beating - fluttering on despite itself. 

They call him the cordial man yet he was melancholy at times. He would cry, quiet, when you knew him too long. When you would sit with him and see the age of it all. All gone and he was the last of a dying breed. He with his hat and his proper words that now were relics and his trembling, trembling hands. Those hands always cold wrapped around a glass of cordial and would try and smile. He was the latter and the last. They Call Him The Cordial Man. ",2018-06-19 11:33:08

Materials: lighter materials, like carbon, are more expensive, but make the overall paddle lighter, so you tire less quickly.

Angle. High angle forward stroke is a more aggressive, powerful stroke for racing, fitness paddling, or current and surf. Low angle is for touring, fishing.

Dihedral. More dihedral, less resistance in the water, and more confident feel for beginners (the blade won't flutter), and less strain in your joints. Less dihedral give more resistance, power for a paddler who has properly learned to rely on their core muscles for power instead of their arms.

Feathering. Ignore that this is a thing. 

Bent shaft paddles can ease wrist strain before a paddler learns how to properly hold the paddle with a loose grip. Adds cost, especially with carbon shafts.

Mostly start with a straight unfeathered low angle paddle with noticeable dihedral, as light as can fit in your budget, until you develop an opinion. Some shops will let you take demo paddles out, so you can experiment with other designs.",2018-06-19 13:37:32

For HW, I think that was the start of a discussion.  His heart flutters but a part of him still wants to be with YJ.  For YJ unfortunately it was the end. She is immature in dating and she needed for him to be as sure and un-conflicted in his desire for her as she was for him. She I think literally could not understand his emotions and how much sway she still had over him 

I think the hosts may have said this at one point - it was almost like they liked each other too much.    They fell so hard which made them vulnerable and somewhat insecure about other person,  

I agree with you about HW being more vulnerable than people usually think he was about GB for the reasons you say

I give HJ credit she saw those sides of HW better

But here is the thing.  That HJ could do that, does not make her a better person. Or a better partner.   YJ seems to me the more solid and more mature person - kinder more thoughtful more reliable more trustworthy.  She is someone who would be a great life partner. HJ is just weaker.  Not just because of career/educational whatever differences, but also simply in who she is at this point.  She has super developed EQ but she does not yet have the integrity in her being that YJ does

2817,"Do they drift over time? How were they recorded? If the recordings are more than a few seconds long and they arent the same speed youre going to be in for some work. See below. 

If they were digitally recorded and they *dont* drift out over time, you need to find a fast, loud, sharp sound somewhere in both files and line them up to start. This is similar to why clapboards are used in film - to provide a definitive moment on the film and the audio where you can say beyond a shadow of a doubt, this frame of video belongs with this split-second of audio. If theyre both recorded digitally this should be all you have to do.

I havent used Flex Time to retime long pieces of audio but I imagine youd have to use polyphonic mode, and have areas of audio before and after your in and out points for the final edit. Then, Id first clear all Flex markers and make only two, one on each end, beyond the in and out points of your edit. Make them on two sharp and obvious  noises (like I was talking about with the clapboard above) and match them to the other recording. That should retime the audio approximately to the other. 

The problem with doing this is, if one or both of the recordings isnt exactly sample-perfect, or has some wow and flutter or otherwise modulates in speed, even slowly, the files will drift in and out of sync with each other throughout the program. This is how an audio effect called a flanger works. The nightmare scenario with what youre doing would be trying to make additional Flex edits inside those two outermost points to try to prevent this from happening, and theres a good chance you wont be able to. Even if you do, you would have to be very careful that you dont accidentally move audio connected to adjacent flex markers when adjusting a section, or youll be un-syncing audio that was already in sync. 

Depending on how far the two recordings were made from each other, you may run into phase issues and cancelling from how the sound was moving around the room in which it was recorded. The long and short of it is there are some errors in recording that cant always be fixed in post, and this is often one of them. 

Hope this helps a little. ",2018-06-19 13:56:17

2826,"From Damons perspective, in the suicide reading. /u/out-my-head-hurts noted that this could be a reference to the sentinels from Arthur C. Clarkes book 2001: A Space Odyssey, which was famously adapted by Stanley Kubrick in 1968 to a Science Fiction film of the same name.  

The sentinel in the book, who lives beyond Jupiter, is essentially one of a race of gods, and was the judge of whether or not humanity gets to evolve past their primitive state. The Sentinel also apparently had great destructive power, and eradicated a race of water-based creatures to allow humanity to evolve in the distant past. So 2Ds saying essentially, god will stop him from continuing on his path. 

I told him I thought it was the sentinels from X-Men by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. Apparently Russel from Gorillaz is a failed X-Men, so this could be a rare lore reference. Anyway, I interpreted this to also mean that Damon might be afraid he will be committed for this suicide attempt, and be forcefully medicated in a way that might stifle his creative ability. 

You know, turn off the voice in his head. 

But sentinels also refer historically to town watchmen, or police, and so in the reading of him being a serial killer, hes saying, dont die or the police will kill me, and you love me, so you dont want me to die. 

Living on the limit, again, an illegal act. Like doing heroin. Or drugging a child. Or murdering someone. 

Ok, then we get the chorus. *All you ever get from the sonnet is the count of the falling of man/Every calling cost made to your heart/You were in the kind of game that put the force in me/I was ever chasing fireflies.*

Its delivered in this heightened, frenzied manner, as if hes ranting to his victim. Hes saying that, if all there is in art is suffering, then the only point of art must be to generate human suffering, and this is no way that Damon can live anymore. 2D is therefore blaming Damon, saying that Damons suffering and insecurity caused his shadow to feel there was no point to the struggle anymore. Think about it: hes doing heroin every day. When he does the heroin, it makes him a better artist. And then he has to suffer, and then he writes his songs. 

This image of a firefly in a jar just as a symbol of addiction is a frightening one. A magical looking creature of bring green-yellow phosphorous in the night sky.  But when you get close, you see its just a bug. Just a normal earthly creature, nothing magical about it. 

But you still crave it.

I wrote this when I was describing [Dracula] (https://www.reddit.com/r/gorillaz/comments/3ybfn2/its_about_drugs_obviously_dracula/): the image of a needle going into your arm and penetrating you is in some ways analogous to rape. The point of that song is that when you do this to yourself, you are raping yourself. 

And you can say that that is a victimless crime, as you are the only victim, but in fact, its not. There is no difference morally, ethically speaking, between hurting yourself and hurting other people. Youre still hurting yourself. 

Its hard to think of suicide in that kind of light, that [selfish, egotistical] light, but in some ways thats what Damon is doing here. And hes not doing it to be cruel, hes doing it to show you how he feels: suicide was not some noble, or sympathetic action. It was the most selfish thing hes ever done. 

And hes sorry. And I wholeheartedly believe him when he says hes sorry. 

Because the final bridge where he starts going off, thats a really scary moment. You know you get the shifting of space in the synths back there, this rising and falling of elements in the beat the fact that the beat itself is reminiscent of a heartbeat. The flittering and flicking, and chirping of the firefly, caught in a jar and suffocating, done in the style of [Princes] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUc0R8bbWQE) animal synths from the mid-80s. It just generates this really unnerving atmosphere of panic. I think its meant to simulate the fading of consciousness at the hands of a murderer, dying from lack of air.

When a person suffocates in the throes of acute opioid poisoning, the results can be varied, but what inevitably happens is that your breathing doesnt work. Your lungs do not have the capacity in take in enough air to support your circulatory systems dispersal of oxygen. So, often, you suffer cardiac arrest, and thats what kills you.
 
Its just the most horrifying thing I can imagine, especially if you are conscious while its going on. 

But what makes it worse is that this is 2Ds reason of why hes killing Damon. Hes killing Damon because hes following a firefly. A bright, shiny little thing in the sky that we would follow into darkness in our childhood. A mysterious, luminous glow. Something small, and sweet. Nostalgic. 

For so long, hes been following this craving for heroin just in order to survive. But here, in his lovedrunk state, hes just going over the edge. An also masochistic love that is going to destroy both of them. Im sorry, he says? Am I losing you? He doesnt say it with panic? He says it like a killer, asking if its going according to plan. 

The end of the song kind of suggests he lets the firefly go, however as it flutters off into the night. The breakdown is similar to those found on Becks tracks, like the end of [Cold Brains] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-1J8svNZoQ) and the middle of [Milk & Honey] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMit8YPadPE). But what effect will this trauma have? We can only pray that this suffering will not breed more suffering. 

We all have cravings. Sometimes its just for a damn good cheeseburger. Sometimes its for a cigarette after a particularly brutal assignment. Sometimes its for harder drugs. 

Sometimes its for sex. 

But what if it wasnt for those things. What if the only thing that brought you piece in your mind, comfort, happiness, was absolute control over another?  

Damons saying his suicide is the exact same thing. 


That image of chasing fireflies, its a wonderfully innocent name to put on a crime like this, but thats because these murderers do not believe they are evil. This is the real problem: people with mental illness, if we can indeed call it that, are very proficient at minimizing or justifying acts which you or I might call evil.  

Id call this a character song but its not a character song. There are no character songs in Gorillaz, 2D is Damon. So what is he really talking about? I think hes talking about his guilt, how his family, his friends and his fans would have been devastated by his death. His guilt over nearly taking his love from them, especially his family.  

I mean, if this Damon guy is half as honorable a person as he presents himself to be then the one thing that he probably hates the most are those times when he feels like he isnt treating people fairly. And this song really lets us know that he feels he wasnt being fair to us. 

See, Damons a sweetheart, hed never strangle you to the point of passing out repeatedly only to prolong your misery. 

Please dont do that to me, Damon. I thought we were pals.

It was too early in the morning to be dealing with floating disembodied heads. I couldn't even think. Was he a ghost or a spirit? Hologram or hallucination? I took another bite of the cereal, and Tim cringed at the crunch.

""Maybe,"" I said, ""because it's the first time we've ever met.""

""Oh, it is!"" Tim said. ""But that shouldn't matter. I am omniscient.""

""Clearly not.""

""Oh, that's not the right word. I'm... A-chronological? Outside of time?""

""Uh huh."" One of the kernels of cereal in my bowl was a different color than the rest. I didn't like that. Careful to avoid touching the rest of the cereal, I lifted it out and tossed it aside.

""And we're already best friends in the future, ya know!""

""Not already,"" I said. ""Later. And I don't think I believe you.""

Tim sank lower in the air, and his features fell with him. ""Why not?"" he said.

""Because normal people don't get floating disembodied heads for best friends,"" I said. ""They get androids, or catdogs, or some other awesome hybrid. I'm not even sure if you are real, a peice of technology, or something spiritual. On top of that, if you are spiritual, I don't know if I believe in you.""

Tim opened his mouth.

""On top of that, you're kind of annoying.""

He shut it again, looking wounded.

""I'm trying to eat my dry cereal in peace."" I crunched down on another mouthful.

""Have you ever even tried milk in your cereal?"" Tim asked.

""Now why would I do that?"" *Crunch.*

""Try it. If you don't like it, I'll leave.""

I glared at the head, then headed for the fridge and grabbed my drinking milk. ""What a waste,"" I muttered, pouring the perfectly good drink into the bowl on top of my cereal. Tim fluttered around, trying to see better.

""Stop hovering,"" I said. He retreated to the other end of the table.

My first bite of the now damp, moist, soggy cereal didn't register. The second bite was amazing. It woke me up and I realized just how bizarre this was. I looked up. ""Who are you,"" I asked.

""I am Tim,"" the head said. ""Achronological time-travel-prediction buddy AI, build and serviced by a real man a few centuries from know. I have been tasked to guide you from here forward, to help you succeed at everything you do in life, and experience alongside you.""

I blinked. ""Me? Why?""

""Because if I don't guide you to success, the earth will explode in three years.""

I pondered that. Then I finished my bowl of cereal, stood, and smiled.

""Well then, new best friend,"" I said, ""what are we going to do today?""",2018-06-19 16:01:57

2834,"Congrats on taking on the DF and FL - two of my most favorite exercises or skills.

As others wrote, you have good foundation strength i.e. weighted PUs, to be able to do the FL training.

I've done a lot of DF training and have wrote a lot about it in this sub.  Consider posting a form check if you want feedback and advice on your form or tips to progress.

Since the DF is a type of ""lever"" there is some carry over to the FL, however, it may not be the *best* exercise.  In other words, if you can do Full DFs then it certainly doesn't hurt you per se, however if you don't have a Full DF it is not a limiting factor or prerequisite for the FL.  

I had Full DFs in 3x10 before I started FL training a few months ago.  I think that along with good weighted Pull-Ups +100lbs/45kg helped me progress faster, but I quickly found limitations on my straight arm strength, inititially, but then hit a plateau due to limited back strength when my Full FL (clean) could not go past 6 secs on the rings without piking.  Getting a 9 Sec FL was only possible with a lot of back strength conditioning, for me.  That's where I've been for the past 6 weeks.

There are many progressions of DFs, from Tuck, Single-Leg, Full DF, DF Neg Only, DF flutter kicks, Full DF without piking at hips (90 to 0 deg eccentric, 0 to 90 deg concentric), one-arm DFs, ankle-weighted DFs (+5lbs or +10lbs), etc, etc.  Many progressions are possible.

Depending on your current progression and reps and sets you can adjust to get more conditioning.  One Full DF clean is fine, but that won't help you if you can't get the volume for training.  I find high(er) volume has helped me with 6x10 Full DFs, with ~2 mins rest between sets.  But I now reduce the sets and use more difficult progressions.  For example, last night was Core/Compression night for me.  I did 1x10 Full DF as a warm-up, then 3x10 Full DF ankle-weighted +5lbs.  For more endurance training I've been doing single leg DFs, alternating the tucked leg when I'm vertical (candlestick) before starting the next rep.  I've done 1x40 reps of this unbroken which is high volume and tiring but really forces me to focus since it is a lot of TUT. 

The show-off stuff of one-arm DFs, ankle-weighted +10lbs, or a static hold at horizontal for 10-20 secs are cool but less practical for *real training*.  In my opinion, finding a progression that you can do in higher volume such as 3x8 oror 5x10 is better. 

I created a **[Dragon Flag Library](https://www.flickr.com/photos/158235604@N08/albums/72157693589833172)** which may be helpful to you.  Please ask if you have any questions or want some hints or tips.

As far as FL training, there are many tutorials.  I did a lot of bent-arm strength training including Tuck FL rows (3x10) and Tuck ice cream makers (3x10) from the bar.  They were hard at first, but I think the game changer for me was to work on FL lowers and FL Pulls.  I've written about my experiences and lessons learned in the sub.  

This was my **[Front Lever Form Check](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/875dt5/front_lever_form_check_please_critique/?ref=share&ref_source=link)** from 2+ months ago.  I received A LOT of great feedback from this sub.  Then I posted more about my FL lowers and FL pulls more recently **[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/8q1veu/sunday_show_off_because_its_perfectly_fine_to/e0fss1y/)**.  I do these as the primary exercise for my FL training.  I do many less FL static holds, unless I am checking form or my hold times ... so maybe once a week, if that.

2837,"definitely not! you need a base to start from, so while those inside falls dont necessarily transfer to outside... it gives you a starting point, and gets you familiar with the process

I had a belayer drop me once. I fractured two vertebrae. As you can imagine, I was a bit gun-shy coming back into it. I didnt even trust toprope, but I knew I was okay taking bouldering falls... so that was my new baseline, my starting point. so I got creative... I put a crash pad under the first bolt.... stick clipped it... climbed up like three feet... FALLING! then jumped off.

inside my head, my brain was all like duuude that rope isnt going to work. noooo way man! oh, hey look, a crash pad! meh, whatever, were fine

so my brain saw the crash pad, and knew that Id be okay even though the rope obviously wasnt going to catch. but then the rope DID catch (because of course it did) and my brain was like oh wow, that was cool. huh weird. so then I took that same little practice fall a couple times until my brain could instinctively FEEL that oh yeah, the rope is totally gonna catch

then I took falls under the secon bolt, then under the third, then under the fourth... then at the fourth, then 6 above the fourth, and so on over the course of several sessions.

after about 4 months I was able to fall anywhere I wanted to on command. 3-6 falls on each time you go up, 1-2 sets total per session, in your warmup, then go have fun climbing so you dont overload your brain too much. 

Nobody gets laid for sending their warmup (or for anything climbing related really), so just shelf the ego an take a few practice falls on your warmup lap in a place that you intellectually know is safe. Bonus points: if you get a bit adrenalized and fluttery... well... that little spike in your heart rate will actually help you warm up faster and more effectively! so then both your body and mind will be a bit better primed for the rest of your day",2018-06-19 17:21:54

2839,"Just chiming in with a super thumbs up for elective c section. Mine wasnt elective but it wasnt the typical emergency after failed labor- I was nowhere close to going into labor at our 38 week appt, but there were some weird flutters going on with his heart rate. 20 minutes of no big deal extra monitoring derailed into my OB saying yknow what, hes baked enough, just get him out safely RIGHT NOW. 30 min later DS was out (ended up being fine) and I was getting reassembled. Up and walking (and showering) 24 later, and off pain meds 24 hours after that (and I have NO pain tolerance whatsoever). Stairs were slow for a couple days but totally manageable, and I was pushing DS in the stoller on 3 mile walks around the lake when he was 2 weeks old. 

I truly attribute the ease of my recovery to the fact that I *wasnt* induced and they went straight to c section. I wasnt exhausted and stressed from trying to labor or anything. It was a surprise, super quick, then over and done with. I think a lot of the gnarly c section stories we get frightened with are far more complicated and worse recoveries because they happen in more emergency/traumatic circumstances after labor fails. Yes, its still major abdominal surgery, blah blah blah.... but a *routine*, *non-emergency* C section is a totally different animal.

No biggie! Im actually really glad my OB doesnt allow VBACS and this next one will be an automatic C. ",2018-06-19 17:37:19

I'd recommend getting it with a powered open/close damper and not just the backdraft damper style shutters that you see on the cheaper fans at home depot, because those ones will flutter and make noise in the wind. It won't take a big fan, I figured your house would need about 300 CFM for 1 air change per hour, so even the smallest fan in that model line puts out 355 CFM.",2018-06-19 17:54:20

2844,"This talk may be a bit misleading - the maturity level of the Dart version of Angular 5 is far behind the typescript version. I tried building the same app with Angular Dart - here are the differences I found from personal experience:

- ngdart (angular_cli pub package) code generation is not as advanced
- angular_components are far behind their angular/material counterparts - angular/material has advanced theming support, a larger user base, and more active development. They also have a data table widget which is crucial for enterprise development.
- the angular_router dart version is more complex in its setup - the typescript version is more intuitive
- harder to use integration with cloud services such at auth0 - along with abundant JWT libraries on the typescript side it is difficult to simply integrate using a vendor's JS library unless a dart wrapper exists for it - and very few do. If Flutter takes off then these 3rd party vendors may be more inclined to put out Dart libraries for easy integration with their APIs. Otherwise a modern app using cloud services is much harder.

I found that for someone outside of Google building a MVP app the typescript version still remains the way to go. It may be productive inside Google but Dart has a lot of catching up to do maturity wise with its Typescript counterpart.",2018-06-19 18:12:02

2848,"Absolutely. Started swimming 8 months ago after being primarily a cyclist for years. It was humbling, to say the least. Old ladies flying by me as I'm grasping at the edge of the pool trying to catch my breath.  Could barely do one 25yard length without needing a break. And I'm tall, wide shoulders, like 10%bf... Basically look like a swimmer without being able to swim.

I think it's mostly just time in the pool, figuring out the little techniques to go faster and being able to relax your breathing more to have it more natural.  I think keeping my legs/hips up in the water without wiggling like a snake was my biggest issue.  Still have to make a constant effort to feel like both feet are breaking the surface a little on every kick flutter, and my cores tight and rotating instead of wobbling.

I've been in the pool 3-4 days a week for the past 8 months and it's gotten progressively easier.  Two months in to it we did a 10k swim and I did it on about 2:20s/100m splits and it was really really hard.  I was one of the last ones to complete the thing, maybe with a few people in their 60s or older finishing after me. Two months ago I did a 2.4 mile continuous swim at the local reservoir by myself and it wasn't that big of a deal...I think around 1:40/100m.

About a month ago I did an Olympic 1500m in 20min and change, 8th out of the water I believe, which I was pretty happy with.  Do most interval work in the pool around 1:30/100m.  Hoping to be in mid 50min range for ironman.",2018-06-19 18:49:48

If you right click on ""Current"" or ""Reference"" in the Match EQ plugin, you can feed it a file.

If you can get it close and just use it to feed the Match EQ, you might be able to get away with it. But yeah, if it still won't line up re-timing to two of the same events in the audio of the two files, the only chance you really have is to conform it by hand using many, many flex markers.

I mean, that in itself is nothing big, I also had the random idea that Tree Hugger plays the didgeridoo. The only reason I wanted to make this into a thread, is because I practically have an entire musical career laid out for her, including how she earned her cutie-mark, an improvisational jazz rock band she used to play in, even a bit on why Octavia doesn't like her.

It's a bit of a journey, so I'm not going to write it down right now.

Being a vexillologist with a smaller interest in heraldry, this bothers me to no end. Same goes for other cartoons that try to have a medieval or fantasy look, but don't follow any heraldic principles. Lookin' at you, Star Vs.

[The flag and logo of the School of Friendship](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/mlp/images/6/67/School_of_Friendship_flag_blowing_in_the_wind_S8E2.png/revision/latest?cb=20180328004302) doesn't bother me as much, because it's a school, not a country, and because paraheraldry in the real world is common in that type of setting. My old lower secondary school has a paraheraldic logo. Hippogriffia isn't aiming to be paraheraldry, and it isn't in a setting where that'd be appropriate anyways. I audibly sighed when I first saw it. Maybe I'm a weirdo.

Also, does that mean heraldry exists or not? That's a whole nother can of worms that most people would've completely looked over. I'm really not sure myself. Cutie marks have been put on shields, but that doesn't make them arms. Escutcheons have been used as charges on cutie marks, but that doesn't make them arms. Now suddenly we have a paraheraldic logo and Hippogriffia's mess that suddenly make it seem like the Pony World has heraldry. Before season 8, all signs seemed to point at cutie marks being the Equestrian equivalent to heraldry. Maybe heraldry only exists with non-pony species, which would make sense, since they wouldn't have cutie marks. I'm no theorist, though.

Speaking of things most people completely looked over: in ""The Cutie Mark Chronicles"", Fluttershy crashes into a solid orange pennant. The very next second, [it's suddenly rectangular](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/mlp/images/b/b4/Filly_Fluttershy_covered_by_the_pennant_S1E23.png/revision/latest?cb=20140403211847).

2875,"Haggard  was a fat giant of a man. He towered over his students at nine 9feet tall. Hermione watched in awe as he guided his students  into the magical creature pen just outside his wooden hut. 
""Right, ladies! T'day we're gunna lern aboot Brarhead Hoonds! Tern to page 69 of yer textbooks!"" 
There was a flutter of paper  as students opened their books.  A Japanese girl to Hermione's right raised her hand. 
""P-Professor? Do you mean, Braehead Hounds?"" 
""Aye, chinky,"" Haggard replied, ""Thas what I said - Brarhead Hoonds.""
There was a pause  as Haggard opened the gate. Two excited Braehead Hounds leapt and barked.
""Ahh need two 2volunteers!"" Haggard boomed. 
He scratched his beard and looked at the class before suddenly pointing at Hermione. 
""Whoremione! You'll do! And I need one more... Oy! Slanty eyes! You're up as well! Get in the pen!"" 
Hermione and the Japanese  girl stood up and stepped into the Braehead Hounds'  pen.
""Now, girls. These are magical creechurs. Yeh have to be be very careful because these are horny dogs! I'm gunna teach yeh how to handle them safely!""
Haggard then closed the gate and locked it shut. 
Ring ring   
""Aww shit, that's mah phone.  I'll be back faster than Congress  can impeach Trump.""   
Haggard wandered off, leaving the girls locked inside the wooden fence with the Hounds while the class watched.  Suddenly the Braehead Hounds  began to walk towards the girls!
""G-good d-doggy..."" the Japanese  girl whimpered, stepping back and raising open palms.  
Suddenly, one of the Hounds  leapt at her, knocking her onto her back. She landed on the ground, her schoolgirl skirt lifting up to reveal her panties. Hermione watched as the Japanese  girl's arms sank into the muddy earth.  She struggled to stand back up - but her arms were completely stuck! 
The Braehead Hound  wasted no time ploughing its snout  between her yellow thighs. It's sharp teeth quickly found her cotton panties and chewed them off, exposing her virgin pussy to the entire class!
""N-Noooo!"" she screamed.
Hermione panicked as the second Hound turned to face her. In a frantic flurry she made a dash  for the wooden fence. There was a small crack between the planks - maybe enough for Hermione to squeeze through. She could hear the Hound chasing her!
""Ah! Dammit!"" Hermione cried.
She had tried to dive through the gap, but she had only managed to get her upper half through the hole. She was stuck waist down in the pen. No matter how she struggled and wriggled, the little witch couldn't break free.
She frantically searched for her wand,  grabbing it from her cloak's pocket. As she lifted the magical stick to cast a spell it was snatched from her hand! 
""Sorry, does this belong to you, Whoremione?"" Muffloy jeered.
The Slither-in student had stolen her only defence against the Hound.
""Give that back!"" Hermione yelled.
""No, I think the class would rather watch what happens next, you filthy mudblood."" 
The Japanese  girl's arms were still stuck in the thick muddy soil. The Braehead Hound  had buried its head between her thighs now. Its long, wet  tongue  was repeatedly caressing her virgin slit, lapping up her teenage juices. 
""Ah! Ah! Ahhh! St-stooohhhhp! Ayaaaaahhhhhh!""
The Hound slurped and slobbered    at her cunt, its hot tongue  driving her  with unwanted pleasure. Her little clitoris  was burning with each graze of the beast's  talented muscle. 
""Oh!!! Ohhhhh! I'm cuuummmmmiing!"" she screamed, her body convulsing. 
She shook and thrashed near-uncontrollably. The unwanted orgasm rocked her body to its core. But the Hound  wasn't finished yet - it continued licking  even after she had finished.
""W-Wait! Ahhh! T-too sensitive!!!! Ooooohhhh! Ahhhhhhhh!!!""
Hermione was not having much luck  either. The second Hound had placed its paws upon her back in an attempt to mount her. It's hard, eight 8inch shaft was already pressing up against her tight vulva  through her panties. It thrust forward as hard as it could, but the elastic panties refused to yield. 
""Oh! Ah! Bad dog! Ah!"" Hermione gasped.
She struggled to break free and keep her composure in front of her class. If she could only last until Haggard came back...
rrrrriiiipppp
""AHHHHHHH!""
Hermione's panties suddenly snapped and eight inches of doggy dick plunged into her soaking wet pussy.  
She felt it fill up her body, stretching her cunt with its thick cock. Almost immediately it began to thrust in and out at an inhumanly quick pace. 
""Ah! Ah! Ah!"" 
Her moans came fast. Too fast. She could barely catch her breath.  She curled her toes  as the pleasure spread like a plague  throughout her body. With each thrust her big breasts   swung back and forth.
She clenched her hands  and banged her fists  against the fence. Her efforts were fruitless though - she was well and truly stuck.
The Japanese  student had cum four 4times now. Her little mind was going blank as the hound's  unceasing tongue  never stopped licking.
""Aaaahhh! Oh yes!! Yesss!!! I'm a little doggy slut!!! Lick  my pussy  !"" she hollered, another orgasm washing through her body.
Hermione felt something thick begin to swell within her pussy. 
""Oh look,"" Muffloy laughed, ""it's knotting Whoremione!""
The swelling pushed up and stretched her pussy, placing an immense pressure upon her quivering g-spot. This was enough to drive  her over the edge.
""Oh! Oh fuck! I'm cummming! Nooooooohhhhhhh!!!""
Hermione's body betrayed her as she came. Seconds later she heard the Hound howl.
""Arroooooo!""
""No! Don't cum inside me!""
Hermione knew that many of the magical creatures in Haggard's class could impregnate girls. Right now was a very dangerous time of the month for her!
She felt a hot, goopy fluid rush into the depths of her pussy  and flood into her fertile womb. The sensation was enough to send a second orgasm through her teenage body. Already, the Hound's sperm were swimming towards her teenage eggs , seeking to fertilise them. As the Braehead Hound  continued to cum, the cum began to leak  out of her pussy  and trickle down her thighs.
""Hahaha!"" the class roared in laughter at the two girls' plight. 
""Looks like Whoremione is going to be a pregnant slut now!"" Muffloy jeered, egging the crowd on.
""N-noooooo! Get me out of the fence! I- ahhh- I need to get the cum out! Ooooh!""
After five minutes of pumping her pussy  full of cum,  the Hound finally released her, leaving her lower half drenched in thick white semen.  The Japanese  girl wasn't faring any better. The Hound  had finally left her alone - but she was still quivering on the ground in the aftershock of twelve 12consecutive orgasms.
Haggard returned four hours later - long enough for the Hounds to fuck the Japanese  girl, and for Hermione's tight little ass  to get flooded with doggy cum too.

""Oh bugger,"" mumbled Haggard, ""I've already hit mah allowed limit of eight impregnated students this month. The school nurse is gunna kill  me...""",2018-06-19 21:25:54

In this context all that infrastructure might as well not exist because it's utterly irrelevant. What _is_ relevant is that

- they've added another official language to their (traditional) mobile OS SDK and are pushing it pretty heavily

- they're currently working on a cross-platform mobile SDK, and chose to use the honestly failing but in-house Dart for it rather than going with a JVM language (for which there are no shortage of devs)

- they're currently working on a cross-platform OS that may very well supplant Android in their promotional efforts in the next decade, and none of it (including the app SDK, which is the aforementioned Flutter) is written with a JVM language

We don't have AWOS at out field and forecast for surface wind is very unreliable.  I do consult the skew-T every day that I fly.  We look at the leaves on the nearby trees to see if they're fluttering.  The leaves on the nearby ridge shimmer in the sunlight when the wind is blowing.  We have two wind socks.  One at midfield at the surface and one at 1/3rd field on top of a three story building about 200 feet to the side of the runway.  It's a literal red flag when they're not pointing in same direction.  The third point of reference is the wind at the launch point at the end of the runway.  We can observe the wind while standing outside the aircraft.  I also look at the leaves on the trees off the end runway.  Direct observation is part of 'consulting all available information' prior to flight.  

Glider pilots also use a 'sniffer', sometimes that is the tow plane sans glider with an abundance of horsepower and an expert pilot.  I always go to the field and observe some other gliders takeoff and land, and decide whether I'm game to fly in the next 30 minutes.  Things change fast.

2896,"I have a couple ideas to look into that might be useless,  but you never know:

Try googling your address. 

Find out the name of former owners. 

Does your city have a(n) historical society? That might be a great place to start. 

A lot of cities in my area have nostalgia Facebook pages related to their town, like You know you grew up in..., [Insert City] Memories, or History of [city]...you can see if you can find them. 

Local libraries (which it sounds like youve already contacted) often have historical things like that and have old microfiche (or whatever they are). They also might have old phone books, but looking through all the addresses doesnt exactly sound like a whole lot of fun. 

See if there is a book at the library about the history of your town. 

Go to the city and find out if your street ever had another name, if they have any building plans (my city would require a permit for something like the cistern you described, but it sounds like its pretty oldbut you never know), permits, old records of owners, anything of that nature. 

See if anything was mentioned in the home inspection that your parents did when they bought the house, and see if they were given a Sellers Disclosure, because technically remodels should be noted on those. 

Google your city name and stigmatized houses. 

If your city has its own small newspaper, or a small county paper, go to the offices. Most newspapers, regardless of size, will have whats called a morgue of all the issues theyve published. If youre lucky, theyve digitized them. However, dont count on it, because you honestly never knowyou might have to flutter your eyelashes and ask to look through. Sometimes they might be bound, sometimes they might be filed. 

See if your state has any searchable databases. Im not sure if all states have them, but Utah has online databases that are available for any public school student (kindergarten through university), teachers, and libraries for free.

2898,"So I'm trying not to freak out. I often feel like my chest/heart is light like air...you know that feeling when you hear bad news...maybe what you would define as fluttery. I'm deathly terrified of having a thyroid problem, but I've had to two blood panels in the past year and the last one about 3 months ago, they listened to my heart and everything was fine other than my iron deficiency. 

My mom went to the doctor and they noticed her heart fluttering and she has a thyroid issue. My mom is going to be fine and I know it sounds vain, but I'm so terrified and paranoid it could mean the same for me even though I was told I was fine last time I went. I already have enough self image issues and don't know what side effects the medicine could have on me. I know it probably sounds stupid but still.",2018-06-20 00:49:44

She sent me to ultrasound and the internal one couldn't pick anything up which meant I was more than 12 weeks.

2907,"Paul stared at the clock from the back of the room. The hands ticked slowly as if they were carrying two tons each. Tapping his pencil against his notes, as he was supposed to be taking the rest of the period to study for finals, he thought about John. He couldnt wait for summer, theyd spend each and every day together. He hoped so, they were a couple after all. He sighed, thinking to himself, There possibly cant be another hour in here! He raised his hand. When his teacher called on him he asked to use the bathroom. He was given a pass and dismissed.
Paul shut the door quietly behind him and walked slowly to the bathroom, wanting to take as much time as possible. He took a quick glance behind him and saw another student sprinting down the hall towards him. Paul stopped and turned around.
John had to rush, he woke up late and hed intended to see Paul before class! Well now hed just have to hope he could talk him into cutting class. He was lucky, running in the door, that he saw Paul walking down the hallway. He ran toward him, hoping to catch him before he went back to class. Paul! He called, stopping when he was in front of him with a big, dorky grin. Hey sexy. He tried to flatten his hair. Hed barely taken time to get ready for the day, and he looked like hed just rolled out of bed.
John, you look awful. And youre late. You left me standing alone by the stairs this morning. Care to explain? Paul held back his excitement to see him and crossed his arms, not giving John the satisfaction brushing off the act of standing him up.
John gave a small pout, Ahw baby, I overslept.. But I ran here as fast as I could! Felt right awful for it. He looked around. Why dont we take this conversation somewhere more private? He gave a cheeky wink.
C'mon Johnny, my teacher thinks Im in the loo. I have to go back, Paul straightened Johns tie and refused to let his excitement show. However much he wanted to skip the fookin study hall he didnt even need, he knew he couldnt get into trouble. His father would be furious. So, Paul gave John a peck on the cheek and said, Maybe after school yeah?
Ahww c'mon Macca! Take a walk on the wild side, hell never even notice! I swear, Ill make it worth ya while. John reached around and gave Pauls arse a squeeze, and he grinned at his reaction.
Paul jumped in surprise, letting out a little squeak and blushing madly. He stuttered out, J-John, please c'mon you know I cant. He shifted his feet and felt himself heating up. He must be fifty thousand shades of red.
John gave him a big, exaggerated pouty face. Pleeeease, Paulie? Im more entertaining than some fookin study hall ya dont even need! What ya need is to relax, and I can help with that. He pouted some more, Please?
Paul sighed dramatically, Fiiiinnee. He agreed and smiled a little at Johns excitement. He was, however, frightened of being caught. They had to be careful.
Great! John grinned like an excited boy. He grabbed Pauls wrist and quickly dragged him out the back door and towards the football field. He peaked to make sure there was no gym class outside before he dragged him under the bleachers quickly.
Oi! Paul was dragged underneath the bleachers. The grass tickling his neck, he looked up at John. They were far out of earshot and eye distance from anyone. They exchanged a warm smile and Paul tugged him down into a kiss.
John straddled Paul and kissed him fiercely, before moving his kisses down to his neck. Mmm Could eat you up, he nipped at neck making cute growling noises.
Mmmf, Johnny, Paul moaned, feeling the blood rush to his crotch. His trousers tightened and he ground his hips up against Johns, almost subconsciously. He leaned his head to one side to give his lover more room, his eyes fluttering shut at the contact.
John grinned at the effect he had on his young lover. Mmm what a naughty boy, he purred, sliding his hands over Pauls soft body. Fuckin around under the bleachers like this, he ground his hips down roughly into Pauls. Could be caught at any moment But ya cant help it can ya Ya need me, randy bastard, he chuckled as he spoke between kisses, his hands working at the buttons of Pauls shirt.
Mmmn I blame you, ya sexy thing, Paul coaxed, letting himself melt at Johns touch. Once Johnd gotten his shirt off, Paul slid Johns off his shoulders as they it wasnt even buttoned for the reason of Johns hastiness to reach Paul. I have been naughty. Are you going to punish me Johnny? he winked and flashed him a sinful smirk.
John shivered, Fuck yes, Im going to punish you! He ground his hips down roughly against Pauls and claimed his mouth with a fierce passion. This was all a distraction, of course, so Paul wouldnt protest the fact that John had grabbed their ties and was swiftly tying Pauls wrists to one of the little metal poles holding up the bleachers.
J-Johnny, Paul stuttered, tugging on the ties. He bit his lip and bucked his hips up in need. Seeing the hunger and lust in Johns eyes, Paul gave a little whimper. The pole was cool against his heated skin and the slight breeze ruffled his hair.
John grinned in satisfaction. Yes Paulie? Somethin ya need? He asked playfully as he slid his fingers softly over the warm flesh of Pauls chest. He was so fucking beautiful like this. He slid his hands down to work at Pauls trousers, fondling the cloth covered member teasingly. My, my. We are needy today. And ta think if I hadnt convinced ya, you wouldve been studying right now. He mused. Teasing Paul was one of his favourite things to do.
Paul squirmed and whined a little. Johns hands felt so good touching him. He needed more. Pushing his luck, he bucked up into Johns hand, urging him to move faster and give him more.
John chuckled, Alright, alright. Ill give ya what ya need, love. John undid his trousers and pulled them down, before he traced a playful finger along the bulge in his pants. What d'ya want love, hm? Tell me. John leaned down so his hot breath was felt on the flesh just above the waistband.
Mm s-suck me, Johnny, Paul stuttered out. He whimpered and longed to feel John. He withheld his urge to buck into Johns face as he knew it couldnt help him.
John grinned up at him, All ya had to do was ask, you sexy thing. He pulled Pauls pants down and took his cock in his hand, slowly licking up it and taking the tip in his mouth teasingly.
Mmh, Paul whimpered, face contorted in pleasure. Johns warm mouth felt too good on him, Paul needed more. He shoved up into Johns mouth, almost making him choke, and tensed against the ties restraining him from forcing John onto his erection. He didnt care what Johnd do next, he didnt care how he punished him, he wanted it.
John let Pauls erection fall from his lips, choking a bit and cursing. He came back up to Pauls face, kissing roughly up his neck until he reached his ear, Now youve done it, you naughty boy. he practically growled. If Paul wanted to be punished, well John could do just that. His hand stroked slowly up Pauls erection, thumb running over the sensitive tip and spreading the bit of precum there. Everything he did was torturously slow. He hoped Paul knew he was about to get a fucking hed never forget.
Oooh Joohhn, Paul moaned seductively, Touch me, Johnny mmmm. He thrusted up ever so slightly into Johns hand and let his head fall back against the sleek metal pole. Gazing needing into Johns eyes, he attempted a silent begging for John to please him, to move faster.
Do you want to cum like this, Paul? John breathed down his neck seductively. Do you want me to make you cum? He squeezed a little tighter as his hot breath made Paul squirm, to his delight.
Y-yes, Paul said, breathing staggering a bit. He let his mouth hang open in pleasure and moaned, Mmmm Johnny make me cum.
John grinned at the power he had over this boy, it was almost intoxicating. He started pumping Pauls cock faster, giving him what he wanted. He waited until he saw the tell tale signs that Paul was gonna cum and then stopped completely, not letting him.
Paul groaned out, Nooo.. John no! Make me cum pleeeeaaasse make me cum. He kept his voice at a low moan, still careful not to let anyone hear them. He bucked his hips up in search for the pleasure John provided him.",2018-06-20 02:38:40
2908,"When I wake up, I sigh. I do not like returning to this world. It never changes. Or at least, I don't.

I stand up and switch on my lamp. The empty bed across the room is as forgotten as ever.

In the mirror, I see myself. Lost. Almost hard to focus on. I will never be pretty like her.

I exit my room and find my father making breakfast. He is humming, happy.

""Hey Dad."" I mumble. No response. Not that I was expecting one. I glance around the fridge, but close it empty handed. I haven't been hungry for a long time, despite the empty feeling in my stomach. Instead, I leave the house without a word.

I don't know where I am going. It doesn't matter. This isn't my world. Im not supposed to be here. Not anymore, at least. I know that, though I don't know why. Everyday, something pulls me harder and harder, trying to rip me away. I do not like it here, but I can't leave her.

As if by magic, I spot her ahead, walking with her husband. To be fair, anytime I see her I have been thinking of her. Im always thinking of her.

I follow them at a distance. They aren't talking, and I think they may be sad. It is too difficult to both watch them here and try to glimpse their minds, not that I could see much here anyway.

Suddenly, a sharp pain in my chest brings me to a halt. It isn't the first time, but it seems even worse than anytime before. I am so weak, I almost let my self fall into the stars, and beyond.

But it passes. I have lost sight of them. With no choice, I lay down behind a nearby tree and sleep.

She is almost impossible to sense. She is lost in some sort of memory. Remembering isn't enough of a break from reality for anything more than a blinking light. More than enough for me to shut her down like last night, but that isn't my goal. I just peer in enough to sense their destination- a hospital. I glimpse red, pain, and fear from her memory but don't examine it closer.

I wake, my head hurting from the effort. But I know where to go now.

I catch up quickly, and stand in front of a large hospital. I paise, suprised when voices of minds press against me, despite being wide awake.

Ignoring it, I follow them in. We go up some stairs. A couple of times, I think she looks back and sees me, but she just shakes her head and keeps moving.

We enter a ward labeled Long Term Intensive Care. She and her husband sign in, and I slink through the heavy double doors with them.

They pause outside one room. She is shaking.

""I... It's been five years. I thought if she could hang on this long..."" She gulps. ""I guess I didn't think she could get any worse...""

Mr. Tomes hugs her. I am jealous that he can comfort her. I should feel guilty for watching such an intimate moment, but I feel I am part of it. I won't ignore her pain.

They head into the room. I catch the door with my foot. After a moment, I peek in. They are whispering with a nurse besides a patient covered in tubes. I close my eyes to cause a distraction.

I press her mind. She isn't paying attention to the conversation, but rather looking a small window. I slump down to the ground, and enter her thoughts.

She is flying again, just outside the room. I darken the windows so it seems that it is just another window. We don't belong there.

I almost wake myself when *she* makes me visible. She imagined me here, and somehow I become visible. She has taken control, and I'm for once the confused one.

We are suddenly in a car, her driving while I sit in the passenger seat. I try to vanish the vehicle but only manage to make it fade a bit. My heart is pounding. I don't want to see this.

She sings along to some pop song on the radio. I roll my eyes, though I don't know why. Lyrics float through the air...

With a start, we are brought back to the hospital room. I quickly stand up and peek over at her. She seems to have started to fall over, but the nurse caught her and leads her over to a chair.

Her husband frowns in concern. ""She passed out yesterday, too, while watching my little brother in law. It's the first time she's fainted in the last three years.""

The nurse looks over, then calmly replies ""She's fine. It seems stress is causing her symptoms. Her brain shouldnt be any worse than after the accident. You should have a CT just in case though.""

Mr. Tomes nodded solemly. ""I imagine... This"" he gestures to the bed, ""is the cause then. It's been hard on everyone, what with the worsening condition. I... She doesn't want to let her go.""

I watch her, and am suprised when she counters him. ""No... It's not that. The opposite. I... I don't want her to die, but I think it's time she let go. Ive been dreaming about her since the accident, and recently I feel like... She's only hanging on for me."" She starts to cry. ""It's stupid, I know.""

I walk fully into the room and sit on the bed. No one pays me any attention.

""I just... I don't want her to be stuck in this world for me."" She finally looks at me, and despite her husband's urges to stay seated walks closer. Her eyes turn to the patient, and she whispers, ""it's okay to go now.""

""No!"" I scream at her. I'm panicing. Why is she talking to me? ""I love you! I can't go, I won't leave you!"" I slap my hand down, and start to jerk away when I realize it's over the patients hand. But she puts her own hand over mine.

""I love you."" She whispers. ""It's okay. You can give in now. I'll be okay.""

I start to cry. The tugging feels stronger than ever. I try to grab her, but my hands pass through her like mist. The stars are calling me, calling me past the voices and the hums and even her. Drawing me to the one universe I haven't dated venture.

""I love you."" I repeat over and over, vaugly aware of frantic beeps in the background. Several doctors run into the room. A final note strikes and holds.

For one moment, her eyes meet mine, and I know she can see me.

I let go, and fly away.

FIVE YEARS EARLIER...

Two teenage girls laughed while their car turned off the highway, each singing off key to the song pumping through the speakers.

*She's just a girl, and she's on fire*

The small car went through a green light, the emerald light casting glowing shadows over their identical faces for a brief moment.

*Hotter than a fantasy, longer like a highway*

Suddenly, a car from a cross street shot through a stop sign and raced right for them. Both girls screamed, and the one driving instinctively turned the wheel as far as she could. The car pivited, spinning to face a steep drop from the side of the road just as the other car slammed into them. They had turned the car almost enough, but the force from the impact against the rear was enough to send them over the ledge.

*Feeling the catastrophe, but she knows she can fly away*

For a single instant, they were flying. The girls didn't have time to even look at each other, but they knew the others fear as clear as their own. Then, with a crunch neither heard, they car returned to Earth it had fallen from and rolled several times.

*Oh she's got both feet on the ground, and she's burning it down*

The girl who had been driven was thrown left, hitting a tree with her back before slumping to the ground. Her conciousness was fading, but she could make out the sillouette of her sister through some low orange flames.

*Oh she's got her head in the clouds, and she's not backing down*

The passenger was half in and half out of the car, her limp body resting on the shattered windowsheild. Deep red blood was pooling around her, while nearby flames licked her outstretched hand. A weak pulse fluttered in her heart, but she didn't open her eyes. Her last thought was wondering where her sister was, and wanting to whisper that she loved her.

2909,"I'm going to be the moron here and say that you should totally try [Flutter](https://flutter.io), which is another cross-platform app framework, but it uses Dart instead of JS and avoids several of the pitfalls mentioned here (in particular, it compiles Dart to native code, so there's no odd platform behavior differences).

2912,"Woman here. 

Personally, I cannot achieve orgasm through PIV alone. This is actually pretty common in women, and can be especially difficult if you are inexperienced or nervous. Also keep in mind that the female orgasm is a slippery mistress: unlike a male orgasm, a female orgasm is not all-or-nothing. It can be weak and fluttery or mind-blowingly powerful, it can creep up slowly and then fade into nothing, and it can escape mid-orgasm if you lose focus. 

The best solution I have found for the shy lady-orgasm is keeping a small vibrator on hand.

After foreplay, my partner and I will usually do a couple of positions and he will orgasm, and then I'll stimulate myself with my vibrator while he sucks my nipples, rubs my breasts/thighs, or whatever. This usually brings me to orgasm. Sometimes, I'll use my vibrator during PIV, and occassionally I'll orgasm like that.

If you and your wife are still finding it difficult to navigate sexy times or if she is having trouble reaching orgasm, I would definitely recommend a vibrator. You can buy them online and they are usually packaged very discreetly. :) ",2018-06-20 02:54:59

Or so she decided as the bristled of her brush parted her delicate, straight lain hair that was ever bit as dark as her sire's.

Such a thing might have been a common custom of the fairer sex in Sunspear but Argella had not come all this way to act any less than a Lady.

2947,">I am also making my feet wet with Flutter. In the beginning i wanted to evaluate the current status of Flutter and under what circumstances it is possible to use Flutter against a native implementation. I must address here, that i am very opposed to non native approaches. I tried a few things in the past years (Titanium Appcelerator, Xamarin, React Native ... ) and the experience was mostly bad. Except for Xamarin i was always bitten by things that do not work properly or that are unsettling difficult to achieve. In the case of React Native there is also the documentation that is often out of sync and it is impossible to track issues because they are constantly closed (without a fix) and ""cloned"" by someone still having the issue.   
>  
>  
>  
>With that Background i started with Flutter with a mindset like ""Ok Flutter  show me how bad you are"". At the End of the day i was very impressed how well things went. Flutter was incredible easy to setup and my first setup worked in a matter of minutes. Impressed by that i started to port an app that we currently doing both native in iOS and Android  just to see how far we can push it. And we can push it really far with Flutter. It went so flawless and was done in a fraction of the time the native approach took us that we're really considering to switch to Flutter. Looking in what limited environment we could use Flutter ended up questioning why we should continue to use a native approach. We are still investigating this and really want to find ways to poke holes into Flutter but besides Webviews/Maps/Camera (that currently do not work really well but work is on the way) we can't really find arguments against Flutter. It looks really well designed with all the problems the native platforms have in mind to not recreate them.          ",2018-06-20 05:48:24
2948,"First off, I just want to say that I cannot seem to find version of Tina's death scene with at least decent audio quality. It wasn't included on the original soundtrack, but all of the videos with music only are just **god awful** - even the audio in the videos that include the scene from the movie don't sound great. 

That being said I love A Nightmare On Elm Street but I have never really taken the time to analyze 80's horror movie music on a production/theory level so I'm all in. 

As far as the sound design is concerned there is a [10-minute interview with Wes Craven and Charles Bernstein](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEq8oyHf-RA) where they explain (around 8:30) that while the soundtrack features mostly electronic production, acoustic layers were added in when the budget allowed it. The ""synthetic, alien"" texture of the synthesizers was purposefully contrasted with the ""reassuring, normal"" texture of the acoustic instruments. However for Tina's Death I'd say the DX7 is more than capable of making all of the synth sounds in the track. From the key sound with the  metallic/bell tone to the the bass line.

There's lots of ""noise"" or foley sounds in the background and the audible ducks in volume where Tina/Freddy have lines tell me that this audio track has already been mixed with the rest of the movie but the dialogue has been removed. 

> I can hear what sounds almost like a bug zapper thingy... 

You're talking about the high-pitched sound at :45 right? That just sounds like good 'ole frequency modulation. I'd start with a sin wave for the carrier then use a triangle for the modulator to get that fast but smooth pitch ""flutter"". The modulator has a high ratio which creates that fast ""chirping"" sound - the modulator is behaving just like pitch LFO but with a **much** faster rate. A resonant bandbass filter would sharpen the sound and give it a harsh bite (this is horror movie music after all). 

> I can hear almost a chord/lead-like instrument thats just slamming on the same note...

The keys are just slamming on one note (at :25) for the first 3 bars but then they start playing the ""1,2 Freddy's comin' for you"" motif. [Check out this part in ""School Horror / Stay Awake""](https://youtu.be/JoPN6xFHPEs?t=76) - I'm 95% sure it's the exact same notes played on the exact same patch, Tina's theme is just played much faster and the phrasing is a little different. 

> ...theres a bass in the background thats hitting all kinds of random notes that I cant entirely make out.

Actually I think it's playing quite the opposite of random notes - it's sequenced! The tempo of the track is around 105 which means the bass is playing 16th notes - with how fast the notes are being played it is **wayyy** too frigid and seamless to NOT be arpeggiated or sequenced in some way. The bassline instantly reminded me of [this classic DOOM track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-o1_i6KKvs) - the same 16th note rhythm, staying anchored on the tonic/root note like a pedal tone (played in 16th notes of course), and playing a sort of syncopated riff on the off beats for greater harmonic/rhythmic emphasis. The fast 16th note rhythm gives the bass forward-moving energy (since Tina is running) while the seemingly random notes and odd numbered phrasing (like the keys slamming on the same note for three bars instead of two or four) provide tension and unease. Though the bass is anchored to the root/tonic it never feels at rest. I think it's playing around the D minor pentatonic scale (D, F, G, A, C, D) - anchored on the lower D note. 

> ...there is a kick drum I hear that starts out pretty high, but drops down low really fast...

I'd start with a kick or tom sample and play around with the decay of a pitch envelope. It could definitely be done on the DX7 (or frequency modulation in general) but getting that hollow, atonal wood block sound from a kick or tom is much easier than playing around with FM - square waves could give you that hollow/nasal sound but would require more processing and work than just using kick drum. 

As far as MIDI goes [here's a nice recreation someone made of Freddy's theme](http://jaygalary.tripod.com/Halloween/MIDI/freddy.mid) - like I said most of the main elements of the music are centered around motifs used throughout the film. Tracks 4, 5, and 6, of the MIDI file have the *gist* of what you're looking for. ",2018-06-20 06:25:03

2951,"I held her in my arms. She held me back, smiling as we spun slowly through the clouds. Her dress floated around her in the breeze. She loved that dress, bright yellow and billowing without being heavy. It had taken me a week to get it right, but it was worth it just to hear her gasp when she fell asleep wearing it. I even had her name, Sarah, sewn into the lining so she knew it was just for her. It was the little details that mattered.
It was our anniversary. A year of sweet dreams since I'd found her in this world. Three years since I'd discovered that this world even existed.
We fell, naturally, through the air, gently landing in a giant soft tree far below. She closed her eyes, inhaling.

_How does she look beautiful just breathing in?_

""Is that...""
""The scent of the trees and the lake where you spent your summers? I hope I got it right""
She smiled, lowering her face slightly before looking back up at me. I loved it when she did that. It was so pure, such an honest reaction. Her embarassment, her happiness whenever I could give her something she truly appreciated. It was everything to me.
She ran her hands over my chest. Felt my heart beat, faster. I held her closer to me, she gasped a bit at my strength. We lay there, embracing, losing ourselves in eachother. In the feelings of wanting and being wanted in return. The thrill, the rush, of being with somebody as beautiful as her, being desired by somebody I loved as much as her, being wanted and accepted by her. It was everything I could ever want in life, the pinnacle of what any existence could be. I felt more alive with her than I have anywhere else.

--------------------------------

We lay in the tree after, watching the sunset. I looked down and saw her looking back at me instead of watching the sky catch fire and the birds fly across it. It was incredible just how good she could make me feel just with a simple look.
""It's getting early, isn't it Sam?""
I sighed. ""Yah, I think it is.""
""Mmm... I don't want to go. But I'll see you soon, right?""
I kissed her gently on the forehead. ""Real soon.""
She rose up into the sky, away from me, fading slowly. She always woke up first. I smiled, hurting a bit as I watched her go.
I stood up and let the tree disappear, floating down to a pool of water below. I had a few minutes to look into the water, look at myself. I flexed a bit, running my eyes over the lines. My arms, my legs, even the tattoo of a tiger wrapped around my arm looked perfect. I ran my own hands over my body, holding it tight, closing my eyes just to feel it, to remember what it was. I held tighter, as if maybe I was strong enough here to keep myself from-

I woke up.

_Fuck._

The world felt heavy again, like it always did. I took the helmet off and slowly rolled onto my side to get up. The machine was humming quietly, I switched it off. It went back into it's box hidden behind the bed, like it always did. I had enough problems, and being arrested for unregulated dream invasion tech wouldn't help me.

I plodded over to the bathroom, sprayed water in my face. The mirror was still shattered from where I'd smashed it a week earlier. I hadn't gotten around to replacing it. Why bother? I didn't want to use it. Couldn't use it. I ran my hands over my arms again, trying to remember what they felt when I was asleep. But I couldn't hide the softness, couldn't hide just how far I could dig my fingers into my own skin.

I yelled into a towel for a few secords.

I showered while thinking of her the night before last, when she'd wanted to go swimming. I'd created reefs and sea animals and even a manatee for her. I'd do anything for her, when I could do everything.

_Focus on the positives. Don't think about how you're powerless out here, or how she wouldn't feel the same way about you if she knew. Don't think about how you couldn't get someone like her without cheating if you tried, or how you're was so pathetic you can't even fit a fucking towel around yourself because you're just a waste of way too much fucking carbon who can't accomplish anything without a magic fucking machine that makes you a completely different person so you can INFLICT YOURSELF ON SOME INNOCENT PERSON LIKE A FUCKING CANCER-_

Towel. Dry. Hair. Face. Don't think.

----------------------------------

I didn't like Paris. It was a popular request, but there were so many more options. I hated designing ""A night in 'Pay-ree'"" dreams over and over again when I was new at my job. But now that I was the Lead Experience Engineer, I could delegate that to one of the interns.

I tried to focus on who would be more appropriate for the arches, but my mind kept floating back to her. She sat in the main office, with the rest of the marketing department. I could see her just through my window, focusing on her computer. I'd managed to convince the office planner that I needed tinted one-way windows for security, and measured out the angle from my desk so I could just see her, but not in a place that was obvious if you'd looked at the seating plan I'd had a hand in.

_God you're a fucking creep. Who the fuck goes to so much effort to leer at some woman he barely knows?_

Work. Focus on the work.

I managed to get the sprint outline finished by lunch. It distracted me from who I was for a full two hours. But then I looked up and saw her. She was at the front of the office, with Him. The man with the toned arms, the man with the strength I wish I had. Even his fucking tiger tattoo made me jealous. A burning feeling, bordering on rage.

What was she even doing with that asshole?

_He's the nicest guy you've ever met_

He probably beats her in private.

_You know that isn't true_

She would be happier with someone like me.

_She'd be better off with poison than she would be with you_

I went back to my scheduling, once again trying to silene the voice inside of me. 

------------------------------------

It was Friday morning. I'd taken her to fly around the pyramids last night. She hugged a camel. For some reason she was really into camels.

She was in my office. It was incredible. We rarely had an excuse to talk, but when we did, in here, in the real world, it was the best part of my day.

_She's not here because she wants to be, she's here because she needs to be_

I opened with some small talk as she adjusted herself. She was wearing her yellow sun dress. Not nearly as nice as the one I'd made for her but she still looked just as beautiful as she did in our dreams.

""So Sarah, any plans for the weekend?""

""Oh, no, not much. Sam and I are just going to visit his parents.""

""Nice. So, what can I do for you?""

""We've had a breakthrough with the DoD deal. They're preparing for a tour next week, so we need to do a complete run-through of the system today. I was hoping you could help me with it?""

She showed me the paperwork. My heart fluttered. We had a potential contract with a government branch for training. Which meant in-depth testing and a complete run-through of the onboarding system to make sure everything was perfect. She was leading the deal, and she needed the lead engineer to do the walkthrough with.

We'd be dreaming together again, during the day. Thank god for big money.

I tried to remain aloof. Seeming too excited would be bad. The devices were regulated for a reason, afterall.

""Sure thing. I can clear my schedule and we can get started right away, if you like. We know how important that deal is.""

She smiled at me.

_Oh god, that smile_

We went to the test chamber and started preparing. Most of the work was paperwork, confirmations, approval, etc. The device was viewed to be addictive, habit forming. It was almost impossible to use it regularly. Officially, I hadn't used it in over a year. We did all our editing in simulators, not close to the real thing but close enough.

We loaded up our profiles, strapped into the chairs, and went to sleep.

*Let us help you,* whispered Matash.

""Ha!"" She said. ""Help me? You're nothing but voices in my head.""

*No...* whispered Enayah. *Haven't you figured it out yet? We're whisperers of old.*

Her cloak fluttered on the right side and from the deep darkness that had come to permanently reside under there, came forth a blob of darkness that took shape of a young Sanion girl. It appeared just a child, a very lithe one at that.

*They called me Shards,* it whispered in Enayah's voice.

With a sprint, the jumped from the balcony. Mid air, the darkness of the night crystalized into numerous sharp shards that rained on the infected as she landed. She extended her arms towards the horde and more sharp shards began to pellet the infected, laying a pile of bodies in their wake. The infected were pushed back as a result, making a dent in their vast numbers. 

Shards held her tiny arms at her side and two long sharp blades materialized in her paws. She let out a high pitched battle cry and ran into the horde hacking and slashing with such ferocity and agility the likes of which Kovira had never seen. The lithe girl leapt and slashed from area to area with feline grace, dodging blows and leaving a trail of dead bodies in her wake. 

The other side of Kovira's cloak fluttered and a large blob emerged forming into a tall muscular Sanion man who stood a head taller than Kovira with arms crossed. The shadows mKing up his body blazed like a black flame.

*They called me Blaze,* he said in Matash's voice and he too leapt from the balcony.

2994,"DLP is a small chip off mirrors that individually flutter on and off to give brightness gradients.  Color is then produced by a spinning wheel with red, green, and blue color segments, though some have white as well.  The effect is that you see a red image, a blue image, and then a green one.  The percentage of the population that can see the individual colors diminishes with the speed of the color wheel.  Some people see ""rainbows"" some sense a flickering image, most are fine.  I get headaches, but I'm rate.

It also depends greatly on the source material.  You might be fine watching regular video, but with it cuts to B&W like in the movie Momento then it's rainbow city.  It also happens in very high contrast scenes like the opening of the Lord of the Rings where you have black screen except for the rotating bright golden ring.

LCD operates on a different principle where through a series of dichroic mirrors (they reflect some colors but transmit others) the light beam is decomposed into red, green, and blue.  Each color then passes through a B&W LCD panel and then reassembled via a prism.

The negatives of LCD is that if you drop the projector then a panel can become misaligned.  Also, the light path often isn't sealed and dust ""blobs"" can get on a panel, though they can be cleaned with canned air.  While a single DLP pixel can illuminate almost the entire area of the pixel, LCD pixels only light the center most portion.  Though that issue has largely been dealt with.

Overall DLP generally produces a brighter, higher contrast image, while LCD produces better colors and is a stable, flicker-free image with no rainbow effects.  Neither is a bad picture.

Given that you're looking at used I strongly recommend you hunt down replacement lamps and price those out under the assumption you'll need one.

I had knee and shoulder PT for a few years back then. Second fold is a career choice in taking care of humans.

Third fold - I believe that, for me, I believe that my entire shoulder posturing is rolled and developed very pectoral from swimming. I need huge development posterior. I also have poor core stability and I probably over-use my upper body to compensate for that.

I find that there is a lot of emphasis on this sport for a normative trend to peak performance and studios are so limited. I almost need to (like you say) private PT if I want to advance beyond very basic without injuring myself. It comes down to anything split grip, one arm, twisty - just risky if I'm not engaging correctly.

3014,"Ah I feel my observations rang even more true with the subs... that and Dr Yang and I think very similarly haha. Massive essay of observations (love how this show tests our observation skills as viewers)

- What was really interesting was that HW initiated asking DG to come for a walk/chat. I understand DG's reason for doing so to sense-check HW's feeling... but I wonder if HW asked because he was now more concerned about who DG was going to choose (HJ) than GB/YJ. I think from the whole HW believing DG liked JM was just his confirmation bias. He was looking for the signs that DG liked HJ because he didn't want to think of the possibility of DG-HJ when literally everyone else did. I wonder how he would feel watching this on broadcast and realising the great effort DG put in for HJ. 

- Their chat itself was quite interesting. DG has come so, so far. I love him and how expressive and articulate he's become. From the silent/confused observer from the beginning to now. I feel like the words he said to HW and HJ are words he wanted to say to explain his choice and his feelings for HJ. But at the same time, they also served to remind HW/HJ of each other when he talks about not being able to help who you like instinctively. Especially HW who agreed with him. That being said, DG really shone in this episode. When he told HJ it's not the end after leaving the house... I really feel bad that it took him as long as he did to make a move. I keep thinking of the missed opportunities for him. If only he took the initiative early like when they cooked together the first time, or had more confidence to be by her side the way JH was to DE. I felt for HJ when she said she's never been treated this nice. It feels even worse to hurt someone who you know treats you so well. Honestly, I know everyone thought it was a shame YJ/HW didn't end up together but I was more gutted about DG-HJ mainly because he was always so, so close but always a step behind HW, and he didn't get to fully express himself while YJ did. I think DG and HJ were the perfect example of the couple whose timing was always just a step out of beat. She was initially interested in him and sent him texts before her date with HW. When things were going well for them and she decided to open her heart to him after their date and double date (you can tell from the double date she was a lot more open and excited), somehow she ends up on the escape room date with HW which ends up overshadowing the other double date. Then double whammy she ends up having the final date with HW after she decided to distance herself from him again after the escape room double date, and wanted to go to Yeosu. Like DG/panellists observed, HW's presence somehow always ends up erasing DG's efforts with HJ.    

- HW admitting that HJ made his heart flutter was the real clincher. I think that was when he truly started admitting his feelings for her. Compared to everyone else, he had the most reasons to have the big head vs heart struggle because he was 33. He's at an age where he wants to settle down, and has been through multiple long term relationships. That's why he kept insisting he preferred someone with similar lifestyle than personality. He was obviously drawn to HJ's personality. But he rationally decided on YJ because she seemed to have the most long term potential in his eyes. He eluded to this multiple times including: his first date with HJ where he said he preferred someone with a job so he didn't have to feel bad when not spending time with her since he was so busy. Interestingly, this wasn't really the case with YJ because she liked him so much, she actually was somewhat more demanding of him. She mentioned a couple of times that they hadn't spent much time together after they went on their date, she mentioned that she wanted him to ask her out, she came to his room when he wanted alone time etc. In other words, he kind of wants someone who can be with and without him. YJ (while independent) needed more of his time to maintain their connection. On the other hand, with HJ they actually didn't spend much time together collectively, she was able to be without him yet pick thing right back when they were together. Which actually shows from a lifestyle point of view, she probably suited him better as well.  

- HW actually had an epiphany during their New Year's sunset watching that looking back really explains his actions. He mentioned how moving into the house was the best thing that happened that year because he got to experience those feelings he hasn't in a long time. That heart fluttering feeling, and going on a proper date. Both of which was with HJ - that's probably why their first date has such a big impact on him, in addition to his attraction to her. But as he followed up, he was afraid of those feelings and avoided them because it reminded him of the previous times he experienced those heart fluttering feelings because it always ended sadly. That was probably why he tried to suppress his feelings for HJ all along because he was scared of falling in love again. 

- That being said, I don't think he was leading YJ on as much as he was trying to convince himself to go for her because she was the person he was looking for from this experience when he signed up. He wasn't looking for someone like HJ who would make his heart flutter. He wanted someone who ticked all the boxes. Which now looking back... it really makes sense whenever he was asked about his decision and whether he made up his mind, how he answered always SEEMED certain but actually wasn't. He was never truly able to say he had decided or made up his mind (with conviction) though he was always certain he knew WHO he was going to choose. Which means that he wasn't sure if he was doing the right thing but rationally he wanted to choose YJ because he knew she was the right choice on paper. He was really just battling with himself all along. 

Anyways I hope there's a special ep and that everyone is happy. It is really disappointing to see the level of hate when in reality these people were brave enough to be vulnerable in their pursuit of love and happiness which in itself doesn't deserve criticism. Like the panellists said, there is no betrayal because everyone is just getting to know the others - you need to date people to know who is right for you. It's the same in real life.

This means you can't include maps or web view into the flutter view hierarchy at this time. (There is an experimental maps plugin which I didn't have time to test though.)",2018-06-20 17:55:27
3039,"**Allow me to debunk your debunking:** 

\>Your mouse and keyboard aren't being used when you're playing in VR so they're not sending or receiving any data. No performance impact. Very few mouse and keyboards are USB 3.0 anyway, so having them plugged into a USB 3.0 port wouldn't use any more bandwidth. 

**If they're on the same USB 3.0 hub in your mainboard OR, that USB controller shares the same PCI-E lanes, they are absolutely using up available bandwidth ON THE CONTROLLER. Go to device manager and look at ""Connections"". Reducing the available bandwidth on the same usb controller the headset is on is stupid. Some boards have dedicated USB ports ""for vr"" these days for this reason. It's not just marketing.**   


\> What does this even mean? Buy a 5GHz wireless headset, plug it into a DAC, and plug the DAC into it's own dedicated USB 3.0 bus? Well for starters, literally all 5GHz wireless headsets are USB, and DACs are Digital to Analog Converters, not Analog to Digital Converters. So you can't plug a USB headset into a DAC. Even then, what is the purpose of this?    
**A 5ghz wireless headset cannot possibly interfere with the 2.4ghz wireless communication between the headset and the vive controllers. This is why I suggested it. A headset with a good** ***INTEGRATED*** **DAC, which is what I was referring to, has lower latency AUDIO. You would still put this on a SEPERATE usb** ***controller*** **from the one your headset is on. Plus they sound really nice and usually have 24bit sound or better.**   


\> There's no benefit to using DisplayPort with the Vive. I'd consider them equal, but most users actually say DisplayPort works worse than HDMI on the Vive.   
**It's not the vive itself, it's because of your** ***video card*****. Displayport has lower frame to screen latency and more protocol overhead for the large amount of data the headset is commanding, which approaches the limit of HDMI. Often, ports on video cards are shared, like, for example, DVI-D and HDMI ports, as well as some displayport ports. This sharing can sometimes introduce latency, it's more precautionary for users who have older cards, as hdmi 1.4 is close to the limit and any issues with the hdmi cable can cause bugs with the headset turning on, or weird dropped frames or ""snow"" on the headset. I've seen it tons of times, I actually had to replace my 3n1 cable for the same reason. Windows Mixed Reality headsets use HDMI 2.0 , the vive pro uses eDP internally and it's a DIRECT 1:1 connection that way without any conversion. Anyone experiencing issues with mdp to DP on the breakout box on the OG Vive got a crappy or too long cable, full stop.**   


Disabling additional audio controllers:

\> Absolutely no impact on performance or latency. Your computer isn't checking these while you're playing a game. Disabling these will improve your PC startup times by milliseconds at most, UNLESS you have a crazy rogue driver or damaged piece of hardware. Don't bother.   
**You're really not good at this. We disable those devices because they're addressed by the pci bus and occupy l1, l2, l3 cache and slow your DPC input latency. Sometimes disabling unused ethernet adapters can HALF the usb input latency, for example.**   


\>bluetooth

**Bluetooth 5.0 and 4.2 have better packet isolation, better error correction, and use thinner band jumps, reducing interference. This is significant for WINDOWS MIXED REALITY, as they use bluetooth for direct communication with the controllers, as I said. Indeed it also speeds the vive up. I wonder why that is... oh yeah, usb bandwidth.**   


Xhci handoff

\>Absolutely no impact on performance and latency. Loading times, maybe, but probably not even a second of improvement at most. 

**wrong again. XHCI being handled by the system directly rather then by an intermediate driver reduces latency between the usb controller and the device attached to it. You probably don't notice because you don't install the correct drivers after. The only reason that setting still exists as enabled on modern motherboards is for 32 bit compatibility. They stopped doing EHCI handoff around windows Vista for the same reason.**   


\> Here's the funny thing, setting the VR pre-rendered frames setting to application controlled INCREASES LATENCY.    
**Actually no it doesn't. We're not forcing it off. We're using APPLICATION CONTROLLED. Application controlled as in, SteamVR, unity, and unreal, you derp. IN GAMES THAT SUPPORT SINGLE PASS STEREO, they use 1 frame anyway. In games written for dx12, they use 1 frame anyway. In games that DO and DO NOT have VRWorks, enabling this feature causes latency since it breaks single pass stereo when you go into interleaved reprojection, and massive latency when you go into async reprojection. It also causes issues with revive. Letting the VR application pick WHICH frame tech it wants to use (which is usually single frame) allows it to function AS INTENDED. AMD LiquidVR titles on Nvidia cards perform worse with this setting on.**   


\> HPET is almost purely placebo. 

**LOLOL** Tell that to Robert Hallock : [https://community.amd.com/community/gaming/blog/2017/03/14/tips-for-building-a-better-amd-ryzen-system](https://community.amd.com/community/gaming/blog/2017/03/14/tips-for-building-a-better-amd-ryzen-system)

\> here's no point in putting only one device on it's own separate hub. Just because a four lane road is empty doesn't mean you can drive sideways through it,    
**Again you have no idea what the fuck you're talking about. The headset has nearly a dozen devices. Each device is it's own ""car"". Usb CONTROLLERS occupy the same pci-e lane and it's often 1x. You approach the limit of pci-e 1x on the headset alone. This is something that was recommended ALL OVER.**   


\>on cool and quiet -  

\> Literally no impact on performance or latency unless your computer is damaged. These settings lower your CPU clock and voltage during idle to save power. These changes are immediately reverted as soon as you open an application or game.  
**Again, absolutely not true. VR titles do a lot of switching which flutters the performance mode. On Bulldozer and i7 systems on some of the lesser chipsets this causes major latency from time to time.. Unless you have Ryzen and you're using ryzen optimized power plan to use the cpu's built in fast task switching, which you're most certainly are not, there IS latency when you switch from P state to Pstate. Even AMD recommends using windows performance mode to prevent rapid pstate switching and allow for XFR to work properly for better single core performance.  I've even had this rapid switching cause dropouts of the headset and bluescreens on a lot of systems.**   


\>4g limit:   
\>Again, OP literally has no idea what they're talking about. This option is for mining rigs. Enabling it on a single, double, or even quadruple card rig will have no performance benefit.   
**You're a pleb. 4g limit (especially on cards above 8gb) allows 64 bit addressing of the ENTIRE pci bus, which has an effect on the performance due to memory dword values being 64 bit, if you had it enabled and installed windows 10 with it disabled. It further threads PCI devices which is why in MINING, it allows addressing of more video cards. This improves the parallelism of PCI-E devices, which include things like SATA controllers, usb controllers, literally every addressed thing on the motherboard, and yes, video cards and so on. Again, this is one of those features that are disabled by default in motherboards so that people installing linux or 32 bit oses don't run into snags.** 

*Some older video cards will not post with above 4g on, though.*

**Thirtieth Day from Last Port.  Summer.**

We made port in the empire of Valyria.  It is a sea of gold that glitters more brilliantly than an oceans worth of rippling tides.  Men here are imperious, the women dangerous, and all streets filled with well-dressed, arrogant bastards.  Cant say much about how wed do in those damned towers with dragons soaring about, but well be right at home in these slick alleys and rows along the dockside, spitting rum as we laugh ourselves into riches.

**Seventh Day in Valyria.  Summer**

Captain came back from some top-cock around here.  No idea exactly who, but judging by the smile on his face and the wagons of supplies at his heel, the captain couldnt have cared less, either.  Were bound for bounty in the emerald expanses to the South.  Seas are never kind that way, what with the isles to weave through and reefs to make splinters of boats.

Old Whik keeps chattering with those damn pearl teeth of his about what all things live there.  Striped cats larger than wolves and twice as fierce.  Bats that bleed goats dry.  Eastern winds that carry death.  All manner of nonsense.  Says theres hidden things in em jungles too; gold heaping on ruins.

Ah, Whik.  He gets like this sometimes, specially when hes got dark drink in-hand.  We just hush that anxious soul up and urge im back to all sweet things waiting for the taking. 

**First Day in Naath.  Still Summer.**

Seems the locals have had their run-ins with many a sloop and cutter coming with slavers round this paradise.  The palm-leaved shacks and stick huts we found at the edge of dense jungle formed a wide landscape of homes.  They were littered with tan-skin people worshipping a figure carrying vivid-blue wings.  Butterfly, Old Whik thinks, neverminding that it had six wings and stood like a man.
They came out in droves, offering us cloying liquids and berries of every color until our mouths spilled with rainbows of juice.  Captain spoke to an aging woman with two shades caught in different eyes; sky in one and autumn in the other.  I learned later that evening that all this was for us to spare their island and women.

They offered wine and prayer with every comfort a sanded tribe could; even had us share in prayer where young girls would dance in firelight.  Judging by what all fluttery, beautiful things float about this place well, I had to tip my head and forsake the Red God in favor of the slim, dark-honeyed goddesses wrapping themselves about my waist for a night.  They were all manner of pleasing, and itd be a burden for any man to deny himself that.

**First Day from Naath.**
Behind us are pillars of black smoke, curling viciously into the sky.

As promised, the women are safe.  Some are here below deck, crying out even now in thanks for ridding them of their basic lives.  Im of a mind to be kinder than a few whove taken to making soft wives of their girls; always liked my women with teeth so they could say my name proper.  Now, I wont contest the obvious benefits that a fist can fashion of women, but as a religious sort, figure Id let my honeysuckle get on her knees and pray while she spreads the good word around with that mouth of ers.  Hard to do if shes missing whites sitting in er jaw.

We took a few stronger boys and made a show of one.  Shredded, keelhauled skin is hard to put outta ones mind the next time taskmaster whips an order.

**Thirtieth Day from Naath.**

We aimed the hull South of Naath after filling ourselves of their local hospitality, which now sails with us.  Rudder turned West of the Basilisk Isles to avoid those reefs, and weve found a series of settlements along further sanded banks where waters eddy into tidal pools.  At first the peoples we met  were much like those in Naath, but as we ventured away from mapped shorelines, we found devilishly strong men covered in hair.  Stocky and slow-witted, we could neither communicate nor dared to toss with em, and so went on our way.

**Fifty-third day from Naath.** 

The men are growing restless without anything to plunder.  We have little idea what were out here to get exactly, and each stretch of sand looks as good as the next to make landfall.  The stars are strange and false out here, drifting like my father showed me some will do.

Women sick with growing bellies only makes matters worse as the mens thrill of conquering their flesh has all but waned.  There is complaining from all sides.  Even I am not immune, wishing that we had some goal beyond watching the sun rise and fall with each passing day.  But the captain keeps eyes steeled on a prize we have yet to know or glimpse.

**First Day of Landfall.**

What few markings of Lysene glyphs still clung to our wide carrack were now completely absent once the winds had battered across its hull.  Just as hope had found some purchase here in our hearts as we finally retired from the seas, it is dashed by these damned storms.  Weve taken shelter in the dense trees where the sheets of buffeting sand cant reach us.

**Fifth Day of Landfall.  Inventory**

-Fresh water: Seventy days.
-Foodstuffs: Fifty days.
-Rum: Gone.



**Seventh Day of Landfall.**

The captain has been informed of our waning supplies, and though he is worried, an Iron Hoare bastard is not moved by the whines of hunger.  He found the lack of rum and what a sober crew might portend to be far more motivating.  At last he shared his design with us.

We seek some kingdom fallen into myth from days when dragons outnumbered men.  That we are in service to some Valyrian shit who wants to wield greater power against his rivals at court.  Hah!  Hoares explanations were met with glazing, blank stares until he mentioned the treasures buried within these ruinous halls, now tumbled to the ground and further below in a maze of black.  

Most of the men could only see the promise of their own gilded futures.  Most of them would lose whatever they gained to gentle kisses in Lys if they were lucky.  The rest would boast and be slit in the gutters of Braavos for what unsquandered coin they yet held.

Old Whik, though.  He hadnt any cause for joy.  Never really smiled once we set foot on land.  His eyes were stuck to the depths of that emerald, canopied forest that seemed to titter with excitement in every angle of the breeze. 

**Fifteenth Day of Landfall**

Some progress!  One of the young ones, Janson, came back with his crew today, all whooping and hollering for his bounty.  It wasnt much; it wasnt even gold.  It was a man with jaundice and so frail, you wonder how he mustered the strength to stand  His eyes were slanted, composure detached and apathetic, but his eyes were bright with intelligence as they passed around the camp, looking hungrily at all that we held.

Old Whik begged the captain to kill the man, but Hoare wasnt one to give up a guide that might know his way around.  For once, I had to agree with the fool who had more stories than sense: this stranger dragged from the jungle was not so much afraid of death, but that he would be discarded without assisting us.  That we even took the scribbles he made on the back of our sea charts as proof that he could guide us to riches was too much.

3051,"hey mate, first let me get the kotlin thing of the table kotlin is still not widely used for android development and a lot of experts recommended sticking with java but learning kotlin, for example i code 95&#37; of my apps with java the rest are with kotlin because overall java is better but there is certain things that are easier with kotlin and takes less line's of codes so yes learn kotlin but i don' recommend using kotlin as the main language for your apps.

no for the hybrid app development, it depends basically on your app complexity levels things that are supported on windows phone might not be supported on iPhone or android so tbh honest i only develop simple and medium sized apps with flutter for example i made a photo sharing app for a friend of mine as a college project, they demanded the app to compatible with both iPhone and android it was only a photo sharing app linked with a simple parse server backend and some live queries so i did it with flutter to minimize development time.

but for an app like your's HELL NOOO it won't work on all the platforms out there and due to the app complexity level you may face very big stability issues of course Instagram, Facebook and whatsapp are developed with hybrid technologies but wait a second, all of these apps are actually websites that runs on servers so the servers and the web pages are actually 85&#37; of the whole app think of them as (optimized webViews) so a faster cheaper and a less complicated to choice is to develop with hybrid tech since the websites and the servers are actually 85&#37; of the app, but in a case like your's where the app dosen't rely on servers or websites (sure you have servers but they do not present 85&#37; of your app) so a better choice for you to better stability and performance is to develop using native, but sure learn all the technologies if you are a developer knowing how to code with different languages and how to develop using different ide's is always a cutting edge skill.

in sumarry, 

\-Learn all the technologies and programming languages you are interested in, there's nothing wrong about perfecting your skills.

\-Always think before you decide how will you build an app, take the app complexity level and the main technology that the app runs on before you make a decision, if the majority of your app depends on a server or website go hybrid, if that is not the case go native.",2018-06-20 18:58:33

3060,"Flutter's selling point is its simplicity. You don't sound like a total beginner and shouldn't have any problems to learn this framework when you actually need it. Just keep an eye on this technology and maybe build a simple Todo app with it.

Theoretically you can rebuild the described app with Flutter but your app sounds like the perfect example where Flutter is just not the right choice because you rely heavily on native APIs. 

I also don't understand why so many people want to rewrite working Java code into Kotlin just to learn the language. Unless you have to refactor these classes anyway, don't play with production code just to learn a new language. Don't get me wrong Kotlin is awesome and I love this language but there are better ways to learn it without the risk of introducing new bugs into a stable project. The problem is that you can use Kotlin like Java without ever learning the idiomatic way and a Java code base won't help. I recommend to learn the language by absolving all Kotlin Koans and create a project that makes use of all the sweet features.

IMHO: generally useful things for an ~~Android~~ *JVM* developer are:

* Kotlin. The language makes development for the JVM so much more pleasant. 

* Good design patterns. Following good patterns is good but actually understand why you choose MVVM/MVI over MVP or single-activity over multiple activities is much better.

* RxJava 2. It's so incredibly useful to avoid the callback hell for all kind of use cases (UI-flow, input events processing, background tasks etc.)

* Knowing how to write testable code

* pure dependency injection and DI with a framework like Dagger 2


Whether you should invest more time into Android Development or learn iOS Development is up to you. A lot of companies still go the iOS first route and you will probably make more money with an app on the Apple App Store but Android:

* is more versatile

* has a much bigger market share

* Java/Kotlin (and the above list) is also really useful for backend development

Could you elaborate on this a bit more, it definitely sounds like a good point but I'm not as familiar with the rendering at that level.

IMO the bridge is one of RN's greatest strengths. RN allows people with a JS background to step into mobile which a much lower barrier to entry, while still giving the end user an experience lacking the jank of web apps in a native shell. As the dev becomes more comfortable with developing the app, they can step into Java/ObjC/Swift. At least that's how it is for me and my team.

Bedtime was so much easier! We used to always rock her to a somewhat deep sleep for bedtime before 8-9 weeks.

Then she started sucking on her fingers and thumb around 10 weeks.  

After we realized she had the capability to self soothe just shy of 12 weeks, we began to let her cry up to 5 minutes at bedtime before we would come in to soothe her to a calm state (no matter how long it took, but we usually kept her in her basinet).

I would suggest first getting familiar with Objective-C/Swift because you'll find more documentation for those languages than anything else. Once you are familiar with the native development I would suggest finding a cross-platform tool. That could be Flutter if you trust Google, but with your background I would suggest Xamarin. Xamarin allows you to use the native APIs in C#, but also offers Xamarin.Forms for 100&#37; cross-platform UI.

Maemo started in 2005. QML was introduced in 2009. I don't believe QML was never used in Maemo, which pretty much died as an actual, actively maintained project before 2010, because iPhone killed Nokia.

Flutter has very little in common with QML. QML is like XAML - a DSL to describe a UI.

It's not that Flutter invented something that hasn't been seen before.

It clearly borrows the rendering model from React. And React didn't come up with it either. You can trace many of the ideas to pre-Macintosh Smalltalk systems.

Flutter provides a superb, coherent implementation of existing ideas.

It's easy to sneer at a project and say ""blah, it's all been done before"" but making a good UI toolkit is hard and no-one has done it yet (at least by my definition of ""good"").

Similarly I think the admob plugin may work the same way. It can show banner ads, but they're overlayed the bottom of the screen. You can't get height information to properly offset your view, you just have to use a heuristic value of some kind, which is a problem when the banner heights are different for larger screens and what not.",2018-06-20 23:01:28

You can write a framework similar to Flutter in some other language, but there is not such thing as ""support Flutter in another language"".

And for pedants: yes, I know that Fluttter is built upone Flutter Engine, which is a low-level graphics/animation/file/network i/o base written in C++.

But that's pretty much it. Sure, you can achieve greater performance with C++ than in Java, but for the vast majority of programs, Java is more than fast enough (even for most games). Plus, you're required to write some boilerplate in Java anyways, so using C++ in an Android project always means that you'll have to manage at least two separate code bases.

But that's a topic for when you have more experience. Starting off, you'll be better off learning to write Java and working with the native Android APIs. That will teach you a lot about how Android itself works, which is very useful.


Btw, if you don't care that much about Android specifically and just want to make apps, there are many ways to do it nowadays besides the standard Java route. Examples:

 * https://www.xamarin.com/

I flap through the grim headstones and monoliths before fluttering to a stop atop a tombstone in the back of the cemetery, behind an unmarked mausoleum. I look back, and as per usual, she's taking her time.

Tiffany is skipping through the crooked tombstones, past soft earth and wilting lilies, a smile on her face as she hums a melody. ""Are you sure that one is the one? What about this one over here? Hmm... Oh, she seems awesome! It was her death-day only a couple days ago, I wish we had flowers. Cadence, says her name was. 'May her soul finally rest after a life cut too short.' She sounds great, I might have to leave you for her.""

""Please, love, focus,"" I croak back, the words hard to get out, and all I can manage in this unfortunate form.

""Fine, fine."" She bounces back on over, trying to sway her hips as much as she can on the way. The skulls of various gnomes and pixies that she wears about her waist click and clack as she moves, the grimoire she keeps on her back flaps open and shut, leaking magic, and the sacrificial dagger sheathed just above her bottom glints as the blade tries to slide out of it's leather case. It wants to draw blood. Watching her make her way over to me... ugh, if I weren't a stupid bird, I would take her in a manly fashion, that's for sure.

""So, is this the one? You sure? Oh, have you considered just being a bird? You're pretty cute. Alright, alright, it was worth asking though. Any-hoo, maybe it's me, but I don't really trust magic, you know? 'The dried remains from 'neath an unmarked grave'? That's like kinda vague. Don't get me wrong, love magic, and this fancy dead people stuff we do, but sometimes I'm a little worried that things will go wrong through no fault of our own."" She begins staring at the tombstone I'm sitting on, trying to scrutinize every illegible scratch.

""Shovel, shovel, shovel, shovel, shovel..."" I begin repeating, trying to have her actually get to work. Being a bird is excruciating.

""Fine, fine, dear, you're rather annoying sometimes."" She pulls out the grimoire, even though it's more like, a rules reference guide, and begins reciting the incantation, poorly I might add.

I hop back and forth on the tombstone, watching. Oh, if I were a human, and I could grab the book away from her and do it myself... I know that she's new to the whole death magic business, but still.

Just as I'm sure my little ghoul-caller completely mangled the spell, and nothing will happen, the ground starts churning like boiling water, and the cracked and fractured bones of a skeleton rise from the dirt. Tiffany starts cheering her success, which stops the incantation, which stops the skeleton from rising further, still buried waist deep in the earth.

""I did it! I did it I did it I did it! Thank you skeleton-man, you'll help me help my boyfriend, and make him hot again!"" She hugs the skeleton, holding it tightly and closely, cheek to cheek.

3152,"> I am aware its pretty difficult to play :)

""Pretty difficult"" is about right. It's not extremely tough though. I think most decent undergraduate players could handle it if given enough time. I could probably learn it if I weren't years out of practice, and I assure you that I'm nothing special. Like I said, writing most of the fast stuff ""below the break"" (Bb to B in the middle of the staff, for other readers who might not know that phrase) helps out with velocity. Clarinetists learn that range first and can be pretty speedy down there. Low notes are easy on any clarinet, compared to being a bit of a nuisance on flute or sax. I think the impressive part is how *fluidly* your performer played it. It's easy to take technical stuff note-by-note and forget about phrasing.

**Suggestions:** Okay, bear with me here. A lot of this stuff will sound trivial and you might be tempted to argue that it some of it shouldn't be changed, and in some cases you might be right. But your score's presentation is super important and is a big part of getting picked up by publishers (or performers but you didn't have any trouble in this case), so I'm going to try to include literally everything I think of.

Preface (notes section): My first comment is something I don't *actually* agree with but be warned that some classical music types have no sense of humor and might regard you as unprofessional for saying things like ""bust out some heavy riffs"" (including composition profs, because I'm assuming you might put this in a grad school portfolio). I definitely had a lesson teacher complain about how I wrote my Preface in a work I was giving *to my friend* and literally no one else. Similarly the tempo marking of Pretentiously might piss off some teachers, even though that is a characteristic performance marking for prog ;)

Also, you capitalized Bass Clarinet once, and that was probably a mistake. Should be lowercase every time imo.

Performance notes: Very minor, but it should be ""mm."" for multiple measures (like pp. for more than one page in a citation).

I would include something in this section about accidentals lasting throughout the measure instead of only applying to the note they're next to. Most performers would assume that anyway, but for modern music sometimes it isn't the case.

I would also mention that for all time changes, = throughout. Again, it's something that performers should infer, but you actually have a lot of different pulses here. 6/4 is usually two dotted halfs, 5/8 is 3+2, 5/16 and 7/16 are weird Messiaen-esque meters. Sometimes if you go from 4/4 to 6/4, it's expected that the beaten tempo remains the same even when the pulse changes. Like you would be expected to go from quarter note = 126 to dotted half = 126. It's pretty clear to me that this isn't what you want (you want tempo-agnostic meter changes) but a lot of music does it that way, so it's good to clear it up.

Footnote: The jocmusic.com website is online but it gives me a http authentication box. Just pointing that out in case you weren't aware.

Measure 4: The A has a natural sign next to it, I assume as one of those default ""reminder"" signs that Sibelius likes to add, since there's a (different) A flat in the previous bar. I'd remove the accidental because *anyone* would play an A natural anyway (since it's in the key signature). This sort of error happens throughout the piece (m.6 has another one), and I'd get rid of the accidental each time unless there's some sort of ambiguity.

Measure 13 and other places: Anything below Eb should have a little cue-sized note (ossia if you want the fancy word) with the D or Db or C an octave higher because the majority of bass clarinets are missing the extended low range. Pro players will have a range down to C, but it's possible that some student without that range will want to play your piece.

C (Brooding): Get rid of that ""circular breathe when necessary.""

1. Most players can't circular breathe and won't learn how just for your piece.

2. They have no reason to circular breathe because anyone can play 4 beats on one breath.

3. If they think it's necessary, they'll do it even when you don't tell them to.


mm. 32-34, 36: I know it's a pain in the ass but I think you should reprint the *tr.* over each note. It's just how trills are usually marked.

m. 39: There should be a way to get that n. to be in the same style of font as your other dynamic markings. I want to say you hold down ctrl in Sibelius but it's been a long time since I have needed to do that. Also I think it should have no dot, and just be an ***n***, like your ***p*** and ***f***s are.


m. 51 and others: I had to listen to the piece to know what ""wail"" meant. Growl is the name of a technique and wail isn't so it should read growl (unless you want to player to take the instrument out of their mouth and wail). Or if you want flutter-tonguing, it should be Flz. I'm pretty sure this one should be changed.

m. 59,60: You have 6/4 marked here when you're already in 6/4. I'm positive this is a mistake. Also I assume you copy-pasted it to measure 76.

m. 72: Sort of on the fence about this one, but YSK if you write cresc., the player will crescendo until they see another dynamic marking, so ""cresc until X"" shouldn't be needed.

m. 85: Using an accent and tenuto together on such a short rhythmic value seems pointless to me because I'm not sure it would be heard any differently than if you just had an accent (seems like a real string player kind of thing to write), but I guess if you think the player will play the note too short, you can keep it there.


It might sound like I'm picking this apart, but I just want to be thorough. I wasn't lying when I said it was surprisingly good. I went to a decent school and most of the composition majors there didn't have the chops or style to write like this, and in fact a lot of contemporary bass clarinet music is just plain bad.

* Definitely did not see HW picking HJ coming. I always thought that their dates happened more out of chance and that he was really all about YJ.

* I felt terrible for YJ. I understood why she got frustrated with HW but also thought at times that she was overreacting.

Eg Dart has basically no way to handle non-nullable or nullable types which means it's a straight downgrade even from Java in a major area.

The words were a feeling, and that feeling was true. Long had passed and now stagnation slumbered in the dark. He looked around and knew he was within his house, and yet he was outside it all.


It was lonely living in a place that did not exist.


He smelled the air around him. It was stale and crisp and it carried memory. Memory would often comfort him but it would hurt him also. In that time it hurt more than it helped.


He looked outside his window and wondered at the lights. He wondered what those lights meant.


*It means someone is there.*


And maybe that was what hurt the most: knowing there was something out there still. Knowing he had abandoned it and that they continued *without* him.


*What hurts the most? The abandonment or them moving on? And could you admit the truth if it was the latter?*


The room was a soft dark and there were shadows of things he did not care for, but they were the things that made a home.


Pictures upon his wall were old and timeless. Men and women walked upright and held hands together. There was one of Lilith and Adam, and then the funeral and then a hazy picture. That was a picture of a feeling, the first essence of loss and hopelessness.


And then Eve and many others. The pictures upon the wall spanned thousands, but he had a small house, and the corners closed in as he sat beside the window.


It was night.


There was rain in the air, but it never rained there. Here was nowhere and there weren't any clouds in nowhere.


But he could smell the rain and feel the cool outside. It made him feel young and hopeful. He closed his eyes and he was there again for a moment.

*Hope for what?*


His thoughts went dim.


*Hope that they could see a life without me someday. A fair life that did not require my interference.*


There was silence in his house. The silence hurt him and he looked around for relief but there was nothing there.


*There was another,* he thought. *Because of him, they needed me.*


He tried to muster what hate he could. In the years past that feeling had gone cold. He could only think of the other as something from the past.


*I miss him.*


He wondered at him. He imagined he enjoyed the nothingness. It had been him who suggested they leave their lives.


*""Let them die, if you are right. If they need you so badly, prove it! I will not interfere and neither will you. When they die, I will stay away as you make them again.""*

*They do not need me.*


But even that was not true.


*I abandoned them. They have called for me many times. How many years has this same emptiness filled them? How many years have they sought mercy?*


The darker shadows of the room seemed endless. He almost wished he would see that face of his old enemy. He had a red face, bloodied from the Fall, and a sadness to his eyes that was deeper than any he had ever seen before.


*Abandonment.*


He was alone there. The hall made a whispery sound of the moving air. He listened to it and it sounded like pencils scribbling on paper. He tried to make meaning of it but there was none and then the sound changed as if to let him know that nothing here mattered. Nothing cared for him.


*I cannot live.*


That was a hard feeling. But the next feeling was harder.


*I must live. It is my duty.*


That hurt for the pain was endless and deep within him. The curtains flashed in their soft cloth and he looked at its texture, how threadbare it was.


*I could see through to the worlds beyond.*


And yet as thin as those curtains were, he could never move past them.


*I am a prisoner here, and a prisoner to life.*


Many hours passed. Tonight was bad. He could feel the time go and the time ahead build. He shook violently and his mind raced with thoughts that he wished not to think.


*Help.*


Then he whispered it.


""Help.""


There was no one there. He looked around and the dark had not changed. He saw the phone on a small table there. All houses needed a phone. It was an old cream colored thing and the plastic reflected a dim light that came and went nowhere.


*There is only one. It has been so long now.*


His hands dialled a number that was within him, a muscle memory deeper than any neurological connection.


The phone rang. He thought of the voice he would hear, and wondered if he would recognize it and if it would shock him.


*Old enemy,* he thought.


""Old friend,"" he said.


The phone rang. Someone answered and he did not recognize the voice. It had been so long since he had heard any voices besides his own.


This was a woman's voice.


""Hello?"" she said.


He had not any words. He forced what he could.


""Hello... I am... I...""


""I know who you are,"" said the woman. ""Only you could call this number.""


""Yes... Who, who are you?""


She was quiet. He heard her breathing near the mouthpiece. 


""He is gone,"" she said.


""What? What do you...""


""He's dead. He died long ago.""


""What... No... It can't be. How is that...""


""The waiting became too much. He thought you would call and ask to end it all. You had all the power. He could only cause trouble.""


""Why didn't he...""


""The same reason why you didn't. I don't have all the answers, okay? He left me in charge of a house I never asked for. He left me here like I've been left before.""


Then memory flashed. It was a dim memory, on the verge of amnesia, and all he heard was a sad voice of young woman. This was from a time long gone by.


""Lilith,"" he said.


""How are you,"" she said.


It was more a statement than a question.


""How are you...""


""How am I here? How am I in the void of nothing? You know the answer to that. You know what happened.""


""You died.""


""I died before death had become a thing.""


""Lilith... I'm...""


""He's dead. Don't call this number again.""


The phone clicked and he was alone. He looked around his house and he was cold and he shivered. The curtains fluttered from the ether.


*I wish to die.*


Wasn't that a sin, he wondered. But he was alone and knew he could never die. He could only live. Heroes only ever lived and he was a hero. He was *the* hero.


But now he was alone and he looked through the curtains at the lights far away. He wondered what was going on amongst the living.",2018-06-21 07:00:56

3175,">This story begins with the retelling of an old legend. Well, some people call it a legend. Others argue that the events are factual. Others call it a fairytale. Heres how it goes 



I feel like I'm reading a prologue, I don't mind prologues but the tone and narration tell me enough to know that I reading something that's supposed to sound like traditional oral story telling. If I can recognize that we're going with a traditional style of oral storytelling then I don't need to be told that some of the events are possibly made up, hyperbole, or fairy tail esque, that's the nature of of oral story telling.

>In a desolate forest valley, many miles from the nearest village, lived a boy. This boy was named Vuurk. Vuurk was exiled from his childhood home and grew up in the forest alone. The reason for his exile is unknown. (Keep in mind: This legend has been passed down for many generations and many of the details are murky. Everytime the story is retold, some details are altered slightly or omit altogether.) 

I don't need to be told the reasons for his exile, more importantly you break from the story to answer a question that I didn't ask with an answer I could have already told you. It completely disrupts the flow of your story.

>Anyways, Vuurks home was a very simple bamboo hut. He was quite adept at survival. His meals typically consisted of berries from the forest shrubs, or slugs that he would find creeping along the underside of moist and rotten logs. Very rarely, he would happen across a rabbit or snake that he would add to a maize stew. He spent most of his day making small improvements to his home. He crafted a small dinner table out of wood from the many neighboring trees. 

A day in the life of Vurk, it's not terribly exciting, but not exactly bad either. I can get why it matters but it it needs something, I;m just not sure what that something is. I want to say less telling and more showing of his day to day life. But that's the same advice you've gotten from everybody else, I'd try to find a way to make the writing feel more personal and less distant while maintaining your style.

>One day when Vuurk was taking a nap on the straw mattress in his hut, he heard the sound of a girl singing. The voice sounded incredibly soft. It sounded both near and distant at the same time. It was the most beautiful voice Vuurk had ever heard. He rubbed his eyes and swung both feet to the floor as he tried to gather his consciousness. The voice was singing a song that seemed so familiar. A tune that he knew he had heard before, but he couldnt quite recall where. He made his way to the other end of his small hut, reached out his hand, and gently pushed open the door that separated his home from the outside world. 
 
This is where your story actually starts, there's something akin to conflict, a thing that's out of place and our first glimpse of Vurk as a character who wants things. 

>The voice seemed to be moving away from him at a slow pace. He followed the trail of the sound. As he walked, the morning wind ruffled his hair, and a few butterflies fluttered nearby. It was a bright and warm day. He felt very relaxed and had a feeling of perfect contentedness. However, for some reason, he felt compelled to continue to follow this voice. At this point he was completely convinced that he was dreaming. He had never encountered another human in the wilderness near his home. He was so excited at the thought of seeing a person, but at the same time he was terrified of disrupting his dream and awakening to the loneliness and solitude that had become his entire existence. 

I find the description to bit a bit overmuch for my taste, but the real issue for me is the lack of urgency. We're finally getting into the story about Vurk hunting for this music which should not exist, and it feels like a lazy existential stroll through the garden when it could be gripping chase through the jungle.

>He followed the voice through the forest, stepping over rocks, pushing aside tree branches, and avoiding thorny shrubs. He had become a master at navigating through the forest floor. The voice seemed to be getting louder and louder as he continued to chase it at a quickening pace. Sweat was beginning to accumulate on his brows and his heart was thumping in his chest. He couldnt comprehend the words being sung. He was sure it must be English, but it sounded so foreign. He was imagining a beautiful girl the same age as him walking daintily through the forest. At this point, he seemed so close to the voice, he figured this mysterious girl must be right over the small hill that he was ascending. As he had nearly reached the top, he called out, Hello? There was no response. The singing 

This is better, I can feel the urgency, I can see Vurk deftly making his way through the jungle and the effort he's exerting. The tension is ramping up as he get's closer to his goal, he can hear it but he doesn't understand it, it's confusing in a good way.

I get pulled out of the story though when he starts talking about the language being sung, he thinks it's in English. How does he know what English is? Isn't he feral child miles from the nearest village? If he can't understand what she's singing the how does he know it sounds vaguely English? It just rips me out of the story right before the climax and kills all the momentum leading up to what appears to be a non-sequitor ending.

If i'm being honest, I wasn't particularly entertained by it, but I have feeling that the story isn't targeted at me, it feels like a story a parent would make up for their kid before bed, but the parent hasn't had enough time to give thought on what the ending of the story is going to be so they just kind of ramble for a bit and then drop the story unsatisfyingly.",2018-06-21 07:33:55

The farm was making a hefty profit, Applebloom started helping with the more difficult chores, Big Mac opened up and began to speak freely, Granny Smith was able to afford a new hip replacement, it was going great... but tragedy soon struck when those dang FlimFlams brothers came in and Flimed the Flam out of the Apple family in a multilayered Ponzi scheme. All 200 acres. All 10,000 apples. The barn, the tools, the house itself, all sold off to the highest bidder and eventually turned into a parking garage. However, ponies don't drive cars so Flim and Flam smartly abandoned the project when funds ran short. Some say that when night falls and you listen closely, you can sometimes hear the Apple family deep within the abandoned garage, silently weeping over the loss of their livelihood.

Whereas last time her rule was only limited to kidnapping, enslavement, ransom, brainwashing, stealing, lying, thretening, and general unequalness activities, this time in her new village she's gone 100% in on the equality. If you pour a glass of Lemonade for two ponies, then you better make **damn** sure it's equal on a microscopic level cuz Glimmy gonna whip out that Graduated Cylinder she keep on standby and kill yo ass coldbooded if the fraction of liquid is unequal. Stuff like that but in literally every aspect of life. Eventually, the remaining villagers rose up and attempted to overthrow Starlight, however Starlight alone was stronger than hundreds of attacking ponies thank's to Twilight's tutoring. An effortless slaughter fest. When she was the last mare standing she took a look around her, saw the destruction, and realized ""Oh fuck. That battle was too one-sided. That's not equal."" and promptly offed herself using her perfectly measured Triple Beam Balance death trap. She died happy.

And because, you know, they're rocks and all, rock farming during rock season takes decades to complete. It's not all bad though. Pinkie Pie rather enjoys eating nothing but Rock Soup every meal forever and listening to literally none of her family members ever laughing at the jokes she makes because they're too focused on the harvest.

3183,"You're incorrect. Actually, he made clear that the reason he chose HJ was because ""she made his heart flutter"". He never cast the blame onto YJ . So in the end it did all come down to the fact that HW was harboring feelings for HJ. It did come down to a change in his heart, not because there was something wrong with YJ.   


Throughout their final dinner talk, it was clear from YJ and HW's discussion that HW also didn't talk to YJ upon returning from his date (it wasn't all her), and there was something between HW and HJ. He didn't deny it,  he admitted it. Since HW admitted the feelings he felt when he was with HJ, I cant see why you are going through all this trouble to point out and exaggerate YJ's flaws, and declaring that's the reason HW changed his mind.   


HW obviously felt bad during their final dinner conversation, saying YJ must have seen a new side to GB, because he had of HJ. Then they talked about how both of them didn't talk to each that night (not just YJ) then YJ commented how there was something between HJ and HW. He then said that he couldn't help that HJ made his heart flutter. So where's the debate? HW pursued YJ, but in the end he realized he had feelings for HJ all along, and instead of going with YJ who fit his lifestyle, he decided he was going to go with HJ who made his heart flutter.  


 While you may not like YJ, that doesn't alter the facts. HW had feelings for HJ that were innate, but because he wasn't sure he pursued the person that made more sense for him and his future. He did this regardless of the hurt/misunderstandings it would cause. In the end he pursued his heart, and that meant going against things he had said in the past, and the reassurance he gave YJ. Nothing to debate, he said it himself. Now I am not saying he deserves hate for his final choice, he is allowed to choose whomever he wishes. It's just that as you point out with your lengthy list, he did a lot to pursue and reassure YJ, but in the end he didn't actually follow through with his word. It's a matter integrity and consideration which bound to cause criticism. It isn't like YJ was the only person who displayed signs of jealousy and insecurity. JH, HW, DG, GB, HJ, and DE all showed the same jealousy and insecurity at times. ",2018-06-21 08:59:29

Same boat here. I remember that it quite freaking tough since there's no ARC for objective-c. Spending more time on fixing memory bug instead of coding actual app, especially just starting to learn the language. 

For hybrid or cross platform tool, I have been researching as well. RN is pretty good compare to the old school phonegap / cordova (webview wrapper). RN is rendering the native component, that's why performance wise is much better. Currently play around with new kid in town, Flutter, seems quite good, especially the UX part. 

Anyway, technologies moving way to fast. Programmers always have to adapt new stuff. For myself, I feel programming language is not that important but the concept, UX, technique, are the keys to success. Those new tools can help you to re-think your old design. How you can improve it? Either you adapt, or you die in the long run. ",2018-06-21 14:54:32

3220,"A long time ago, there was a girl who was not only pretty but also big and strong. She worked as a maid on a farm by Lake Hjrtasjn in southern Nerike. She was ploughing with the farm's horse on one of the fields by the lake. It was springtime and beautiful weather. The birds chirped and the wagtails flitted in the tracks of the girl and the horse in order to pick worms. All of a sudden, a horse appeared out of the lake. It was big and beautiful, bright in colour and with large spots on the sides. The horse had a beautiful mane which fluttered in the wind and a tail that trailed on the ground. The horse pranced for the girl to show her how beautiful he was. The girl, however, knew that it was the brook horse and ignored it. Then the brook horse came closer and closer and finally he was so close that he could bite the farm horse in the mane. The girl hit the brook horse with the bridle and cried: ""Disappear you scoundrel, or you'll have to plough so you'll never forget it."" As soon as she had said this, the brook horse had changed places with the farm horse, and the brook horse started ploughing the field with such speed that soil and stones whirled in its wake, and the girl hung like a mitten from the plough. Faster than the cock crows seven times, the ploughing was finished and the brook horse headed for the lake, dragging both the plough and the girl. But the girl had a piece of steel in her pocket, and she made the sign of the cross. Immediately she fell down on the ground, and she saw the brook horse disappear into the lake with the plough. She heard a frustrated neighing when the brook horse understood that his trick had failed. Until this day, a deep track can be seen in the field.    this is cool, i live in souther nerike myself",2018-06-21 15:49:57

I was just lost in my imagination which was incredibly vivid and active, my attention wasn't on any particular thing for more than 10-15 seconds, plus with being out of my mind with euphoria yeah there wasn't much opportunity to take care of my life. I would just flutter around doing busy work but mostly pacing and smoking my head off ranting to myself. I found myself verbalizing my flighty thought patterns without realizing it. I also got impulsive too and it became harder to discern where my imagination and real life are separated.

I didn't want to be social per se, I was just desperate to have a conversation with anyone about anything. I had a real bad time, I thought I was losing my mind so I'd just pace around outside the house hoping somebody talked to me.

3237,"Copy/paste from another thread along similar lines.

 This'll get buried but I love telling this story, too.

So this takes place roughly around the age of 15. I was walking to school with a friend, wide awake for a lazy 15 year old. To get to our school you had to walk down a large (absolutely massive) hill road and at the bottom was a road with a bus stop across the street. So we're walking down the path behind a woman in a scarf who was drinking coffee. My mate and I were quiet, early morning is not conductive for talk and I remember watching her walk (I liked her scarf) when suddenly *she split into two people*. The form that was clearly more real - and therefore ""her"" had chosen to cross the road at an earlier junction to get to the bus stop and the less defined but still very much real to me version of her kept walking down the road. It moved and behaved exactly like a real person would - she drank coffee and the wind fluttered her scarf. I went as white as a sheet and turned to my mate to ask if she was seeing this shit - she hadn't. I turned back - the other form of the woman was gone.",2018-06-21 17:44:10
3238,"1: Yes, you can give them a command or suggestion while hypnotized that in some way or form allows the sub to dissent from anything they're not comfortable with or unsure of. My method is to simply tell my subject that while they're under, if i give them a suggestion or command in that vein, they can tell me they will not accept the suggestion or need more information about it before we can proceed.  
2: Yes, there can be, if you're not careful, but that kind of situation requires long term reinforcement or the most suggestive of subjects. More often than not, you'll be able to know or find out when something is off, and deal accordingly. Obviously being prepared, cautious, and doing things right is preferable. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of the cure, as I believe the saying goes.  
3: I've not been a subject, so I can't help with this one, unfortunately  
4: For me, it's a lot of feelings and thoughts at once. I'm always making sure I have the next few steps of the session ready in my head. I also always try to account for every possible outcome of anything I do, and I've become meticulous about wording when giving a suggestion. If a subject is the kind of person who wants to always feel safe during a session, I'll be sure to tune things to that. If they want it to be purely erotic and carnal, then that. If they want it to be raw control, that. And on and on.  
I also make sure that I tune the session and suggestions to the type of subject someone is. If they like being given detailed, explicit instruction, I provide that, and leave no room for any misinterpretation. If they want suggestions given vaguely, with room to interpret, I give suggestions in a way that leaves no room for gross misinterpretation, but also lends the subject freedom to take the commands how their mind interprets them (this most often works best in a more casual setting, or even parties, because it's more on the entertaining end than the sexy end, in my experience).  
As for my actual feelings during a session... It's usually a mix of excitement and relaxation. I have done this for years now and I STILL get that little flutter of joy when the moment comes when I'm sure a subject is under. I balance that with having the experience to make sure I don't get caught up in the excitement, and stay on track (or improvise properly if I have to).  
5: I've actually kind of already explained this one in part 4, so basically just make sure your sub always has an ""opt out"" for suggestions, scenarios, etc, and make sure the session is right for everyone involved. This can be a tough juggling act, but experience breeds skill highly. If you're willing to look for something to learn from in every single session, you will grow exponentially faster.

3243,"Yes. I believe true love can end. Out of the five guys Ive loved  in my past, Id say I still have loving feelings for two of them. I feel in love with them in my teens and twenties and am now in my forties so feelings definitely change over time.

My high school boyfriend was my first love. We are still good  friends 30+ years after we broke up. Its not a romantic love, but we will always hold a special place in each others hearts.

One guy broke my heart and once it healed I didnt feel anything for him. Another guy I continued to care about in the sense of wishing him well but romantic love died over time.

Even though its been 20 years since I last saw him, the guy that got away could probably still make my heart flutter if I saw him today. We were a right person/wrong time situation and managed to stay long distance friends for 6 years after we broke up. Our friendship faded when we met our spouses. I think the only way we could fall in love with our spouses was to let go of each other.

I have no love for my ex despite more than 20 years together. I only care for his well being as the father of my children. He no longer resembles the person I fell in love with and loved for many years. I once explained to a friend that it felt like my husband had died and I was living with his murderer.

>Now I do not know whether I was then a man dreaming I was a butterfly, or whether I am now a butterfly, dreaming I am a man. Between a man and a butterfly there is necessarily a distinction. The transition is called the transformation of material things.

It's a story used to illustrate this important aspect of Daoism. The principle that while all things are unified in potential, they are simultaneously disunited in manifestation. What is the difference between being a man, and being a butterfly who is dreaming of being a man?

3254,"I suppose instructions for mindfulness of breath meditation that dont conflate active mindful observation of the present moment with mindfulness of breath meditation, which dissociates from the present moment to observe the process of breathing.

Prana meditation is controlling breath meditation.

Mindfulness of breath is observing the occurrence of breath in meditation.

The first maneuver in kung fu is kung fu breathing (sometimes called [exotic animal] breath) which is to inhale, pause, exhale, pause, repeat, with the intention being to get as much old air out as possible.

The breaths in mindfulness of breath are generally calm and slow not controlled but if youre sitting down to meditate while upset, your breathing may be  labored and fast, and your meditation will go poorly.

If you are upset, before you meditate, just as you suggested, take five deep and slow, deliberate breaths, which has been shown to reduce stress and anger, this is the why, before meditating.

Meditating while upset can enhance the upsetness because it is what is foremost on the mind, so to open with deep breaths is good for relief from stress and anger.

I agree with the action but without reason there is only empty acceptance without understanding.

ASMR is the sensation that all the gurus talk about as the feeling of kundalini awakening or of divine radiance.

ASMR is why people who are touched by the hand of a pastor feel as though it is a strike from the hand of god, and they believe it so that they collapse.

ASMR is the opening of the energy channels.

It is a sensory ripple that feels like a tickly tingly wave that starts in the scalp (usually) and then runs down the spine (usually) and is compared to the orgasm sensation or to a the distressful fluttery tingling of a waking limb if it were that instead of distress and nubness it came with tickling.

Its caused by feeling good.

No magic energy channels. 

Just feel good concentrate the good feeling and feel it hit you.

Most often certain musical crescendos cause it, as in the crescendo from Adagio from Spartacus which has been compared to the sensation of falling in love.

ASMR isnt meditation magic, anybody can have that.

What meditation does is it defrags the scattered mind.

It wont make you be this way or that way and it wont solve the problems in your life, unless you proactively try to behave this way and that while letting meditation reconnect your mind to itself.

Then, as meditation does its work, your behavior produces an interference pattern that writes in your new habits and hopefully relocates unwanted or bad habits, but dont just believe the new you be it and take up those behaviors or it wont take hold.

Look straight up, straight up as you can, now level your head atop your straight spine. 

I believe our ancestors looked to the skies and thats how they learned to stand straight.

Aside from my generally exclusive recommendation for general mindfulness of breath, disregarding all thoughts that arise and only following the breath, I also recently started to recommend this meditation from the worlds happiest man, Matthieu Ricard, to people who are depressed or experiencing anxiety, I think this is the magic most people really want meditation to deliver, just feel happier:

3274,"You are missing a good bit of the story, actually! The bits from the storybooks for Miss Bone and Underworld Lord. Sorrry for how long this is going to be, but starting off with Miss Bone:

In the night when moonlight is dim, the alley was full of shadows and scary, pointed things.
The young man abandoned his fear for the girl he loved.
He wanted to hold her hand, but when he turned to reach for it, she happened to move aside, her white dress fluttering slightly.
Blushing, he pulls back his hand and smiles awkwardly at her.
Wed better hurry up, this alley is dangerous.
But why? asked the girl, her voice as soft and sweet as sugar.
The boy knew he shouldnt tell her, as time was of the essence, but his love for her made him indulge her curiosity.
Lowering his voice, he answered, 'There are ghosts that inhabit this alley. They lurk in the shadows where the moonlight cannot reach, and eat all passers-by.'
Really? she asked as she followed him. Do you truly believe in this ghost story?
The boy turned to her and, with a solemn look, only said, Im willing to fight off any ghosts that come our way.
Hearing his valiant oath, the girl couldnt help but giggle sweetly, her face obscured by her open parasol.
Adora...why is your parasol open so late at night? 
The girl realized this, and replied,
Oh, I must have forgotten to fold it. Her voice crooned like a nightingales. She folded her lace umbrella and let the moon shine upon her body and dress, giving off an eerie luminescence.
Shes now but a pale skeleton in a girls dress. She reached out to touch the boys face with her bony hand.
You dont have to fight off any ghosts for little ol me, said the pleasant voice emanating from the rattling skeleton's jaw.
'Just close your eyes and be nice as I devour you where you stand!
The city is still rife with stories of people being devoured by ghosts.
Adoras eyelids fluttered like a butterfly poised to take off.
The officers could only send more men to protect her, as suitors of all kinds approached her. Young men displayed their weapons and martial prowess before her, while wealthy businessmen offered her expensive gifts of rose bouquets and jewelry. Poets and other scholars penned long and beautiful poems in her name, day and night, waxing lyrical of her beauty and their affection for her.
Dont be afraid. Even without weapons or armor, I will protect you with my body.
A timid smile appeared on her face.
I trust you.
Adora didnt know how to refuse any of them, so they all believed themselves to be the closest to winning her heart.
She was like a beautiful, dew-covered gardenia in bloom, one that needed tender and constant care. Everyone was so enamored by her beauty; they chased her like chasing the only ray of moonlight in the dark.
Everyone has a girl of their dreams, and she was that girl for them.
Slender and delicate, but unbendingly strong-willed even in the face of unknown terrors.
Once, when a young man was escorting her home, he disappeared in an alley and was never seen again.
All that was left of him to bury were his clothes, mysteriously left behind.
As she laid some lilies upon his tomb, she clasped her hands in prayer.
I will find the murderer, she silently promised him.
A frail flower like her, looking into the darkness for the culprit; it was a heart-wrenching sight for any to behold. The exorcists came to her, one by one, assuring her of her safety so long as they were allowed to guard her.
A kind, young man brought her a stack of information; upon holding it up, a fragrant love letter addressed to Adora fell out of the stack.
Unfurrowing her brow, she smiled shyly.
Late at night, Adora picked up a pen and drew a gardenia on the map she was given, marking the largest house in the city: the famous Yoos Mansion.
The young lady of Yoos Mansion was a well-known philanthropist. She ran a charitable institution to house orphans and the poor. Everyone praised her kindness, but no one really knew what happened to the large number of people living inside its walls.
Its strange.
Adora rotated her parasol in her hands as she sang song on her way home, leaving the boy who brought her information in the shadow behind.
The fresh, living blood flowing through her veins was full of love, putting her in a pleasant mood she hadnt felt before.
She may just meet her soon...the real lord of this city....
One is not living nor dead, one doesn't age nor die. A master of all the underworld creatures... 
Miss Stich, lady of Yoos Mansion.
The full moon in the sky moves slowly, gradually changing the angle of the moonlight.
Her parasol could not completely shield her from the light, and half of her face was exposed to the moon. It revealed original, skeletal form just beneath her fresh, youthful skin.
Adora had suddenly decided to make friends with Lady Stich.
She found a shabby ragdoll on the street and set herself to mending it.
Sewing the bones, injecting it with blood, and sealing its soul...
After the final stitch, the dolls mouth moved and began to sing a soundless tune.
Adora kissed the doll on its delicate cheek and carefully wrapped it up.

I pray that this gift allows us to meet in a dream-like wonderland.",2018-06-21 22:53:14

[Here is a $29,000 turntable](https://clearaudio.de/en/products/turntables-innovation.php) with a servo speed control. The speed deviation is .05% this [Hitachi HT-L70](https://www.vinylengine.com/library/hitachi/ht-l70.shtml) is 0.003%. You want a belt drive that bests the 1200 in rumble [here is a SOTA](http://www.sotaturntables.com/newtables/sapphirejewel.htm). Still doesn't have the same speed stability though. 

I've look at the specs for many turntables. The conclusions I've reached should be pretty obvious to anyone who researched the available turntables out there. Rega doesn't even publish figures for their fucking turntables, and it is [widely reported that they don't even run at 33.33rpm](https://www.google.ca/search?q=rega+turntable+runs+fast&oq=rega+turntable+runs+fast&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l2.4477j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8), yet people will fucking gleefully hand over $1000 for a P3 when you could easily buy a really, really nice vintage DD for that amount of money (which actually posted specs and real engineering behind them). 

How do you even shop for your turntable? If you upgrade, what criteria will use to determine whether a new table is worth purchasing?

I also own the Hitachi that I mentioned. It works great. Not that the fact that I've heard it means anything. Human perception is subject to huge numbers of biases. The measurements given to you by the manufacturer are probably your best source of information. They're much better than whatever subjective impression someone on the internet gives you. 

My question is why do accept other subjective claims with no evidence (especially when subjective evidence is heavily biased), but you demand data from me? I haven't provided enough examples you can simply lookup any decent DD table (Sony, JVC, Denon, Pioneer all made great tables [you can look at some of them here](http://www.thevintageknob.org/)) and then compare it to the best belt drive turntable (provided you can actually find numbers for them) and compare them for yourself. Clearaudio is one of the few high-end manufacturers that actually posts numbers (and they don't do rumble). The [Roksan Xerxes](http://www.roksan.co.uk/products/xerxes-20plus-turntable/) is probably one of better belt driven models. They still don't state what scale they use for wow & flutter (all wow & flutter is weighted somehow and there are different schemes), nor do they do so for their rumble (possibly DIN A weight, but is that used anymore? I guarantee that isn't the unweighted rumble). The figures aren't much if any better than the SL1200 and it sells for 7000 which is far more than the *new* Technics SL1200G. 

Now you have your data. Those are the absolute *best* belt drives I could find. The lowly old SL1200 is a pretty good competitor for them at a lower cost. Even if you are comparing the new 1200G to them it still comes out ahead in terms of cost/performance.  ",2018-06-21 23:09:05

You're probably right. I hooked up a belt drive which had much higher W&F than my PS-X800, pitch was stable enough. A DD still does have measurable benefits, but it would take a lot testing to detect to what extent they are audible (even if they are). I don't know how much if any testing has been done.

>
If I had to buy a new deck, I'd do belt. I don't know if small companies have the engineering muscle (especially in woo woo audiophile land) or R&D budgets to knock out a solid, reliable DD system.

I don't think it is even a question of engineer prowess. Companies are so caught up in the ""belt drive>DD"" that there isn't any incentive to make a DD. I think audiophile companies killed the market for DD by insisting (and convincing reviewers) that belt drive was superior because the simply couldn't compete with the engineering might of Japanese manufacturers. They had to make up bullshit in order to survive, and that bullshit has persisted.

If you do a buy a new deck, you should keep in mind that Technics does have a new [1200G](https://www.technics.com/us/products/grand-class/direct-drive-turntable-system-sl-1200g.html), which is an improvement over the original. It's fairly pricey ($4000), but it isn't that expensive compared high-end belt drive offerings from Rega and the like. If you want something from a small company (and have money to spend), [Primary Control makes a DD turntable](http://www.primarycontrol.nl/Kinea_Turntable_Direct_Drive_Motor.html). They've also got some of the most innovative arms around. They actually have anti-skate that varies! Something every arm should have, but no one does. Fuck, Shindo puts a 12"" arm on their table and it doesn't even have any anti-skate. They claim it isn't necessary for an arm of that lengtheven though I am pretty sure skating forces would be *greater* for a 12"" arm since the offset between the pivot and stylus is greater. VPI doesn't do anti-skating either. They make a DD turntable, but it is $30,000 and doesn't really measure any better than good vintage DD tables.  ",2018-06-21 23:28:38

3302," supper long comment

The last episode cleared a lot of things, and looking back at earlier episodes, from the very beginning after HW's first date with HJ you can tell both DE and YJ are jealous, all the girls wanted a date with HW, from ep 3. DE, however, is happy for HJ but YJ somehow wants to compete with HJ and goes on and asks HW out for a date. She voluntarily selected him and HW also was interested in her since she ""fitted"" his ideal type. The show permits him to pursue someone and check them out. HW was really honest with his choice until the escape the room episode. I have never seen HW participate so much in conversations and happy. Even during the escape the room part as they entered he casually helped HJ take off her goggles and touched her hand as he helped her into through the small door. You could see how close he was getting to her while they were playing. He was basically attracted to her. While with YJ and GB he was a bit conscious of YJ to show his feelings but you could see how YJ was already catching on. HW was pretty much on fire that day. But unexpectedly, YJ asks him on a date the next day, he was surprised to believe it himself. He even asked her, the reason behind the date, he was flustered...That day when she asks him, she says, ""you can't say no this time,"" implying that he declined her numerous times. YJ was basically leading him on all dates. All you could hear from HW when asked about his feelings towards YJ is that she is similar to him and that he thinks they can get along with each other. He also directly tells YJ on their date that he is not looking for romance, and he came so that he could find a serious relationship. However, HJ like he admitted made his heart flutter. It's a fact. 

In his last conversation with YJ you can tell that HW is somehow feeling sorry towards YJ when he says, true I spent a lot of time with you... He looks so defeated, he tried so hard to find some sort of strong connection between them but he couldn't... The little time he spent with HJ was so intense and as he agrees with DG there is no particular reason. He said in the end that he stopped thinking, HW was up till 5:30 Am at times because of how confused he was, we know this by when YJ asks him why he was sleeping till this late and he replies he slept at 5:30 Am, so his choice was so thorough. Even after the date with HJ in Suncheon he was uncomfortable because of the confrontation with DG he was going to have and he looked sad on how he could approach YJ and explain his heart. HW, as we are often shown, is a very reserved person but he always spoke clearly to HJ but not YJ, he beat around the bush with YJ. When he went shopping with HJ you could see how he touched her jacket when he asked about why she was so polite, he was really awkward and just kept mumbling the whole time as he talked about what to eat, you could see HJ silence kind of made him so nervous. Well, well, if you try to analyze HW more and more you will find out how hard he worked to make the choices he made, and really appreciate the effort he put in to restrain himself from his own heart. He was so much trying to settle but oh well you can't deny the heart. 

For HJ she was always pushing DG away, at the same time she showed gratitude towards him by taking him on a date and also eating the Oxtail soup with him, she always stopped him when he tried to confess or praise her, since she was aware of his feelings, and she dismissed him gently not with force. Despite knowing that HW did not show interest in her she still pursued him... She doesn't give HW a silence treatment but expresses very well that she is uncomfortable. She was very consistent with how she acted in front of the guys and the girls as well, you can feel her personality throughout except the moment when she was heartbroken. She was cute and laughed a lot in front on both the girls and guys. She also showed maturity on how she acted when HW was focused on YJ, on their double date, he said, "" I like You,"" to Young Ju, when HW looked at HJ's reaction she was laughing and did not sulk and get so jealous when the two were paired. I really loved the way she understands the program and sends signals without pressing hard on other housemates about their choices. Even, on their first date with HW, she asked about his feeling for YJ and when he took too long to answer she answered it was too early to tell. She is really too mature for her age... Respect her, she looks like she would act so childish but she acted with more awareness of her actions.

If you look at YJ on the other hand, She is somehow competitive with HJ, she was interested in DG who showed no interest in her but HJ in the beginning and she really wanted to win HW's heart and was extremely jealous when HJ's name was mentioned. I could see that her feelings for HW went deep as she asked him on dates, but oh well. The great thing about YJ is that she gives advice to other housemates, even though those are advice that anyone could give you, I mean they were always opposite of what I saw her do, which she reflects on in the end. YJ her personality was consistent throughout but she acted a bit differently towards HW. She acts strong but melts down with a small misunderstanding between her and HW, every time about HJ, even the panelist kept saying again!!!! The show allows everyone to date each other until the final choice, I was surprised to see how she wanted a commitment by the 2nd week. YJ is very pretty and I think without putting her pride in, she would have been able to sincerely fall in love and find someone that was perfect for her in the signal house. 

Personally, I loved DG but he is a very shy guy, I think as far as the show goes, he won, because he was always having conversations with himself and communicated with the other housemates with his eyes for the first few days. He was basically in his own world while other housemates were growing feelings for each other. He was able to express himself when HJ went on a date with him, he was able to move her heart and was nice throughout. I think he grew more than anyone on this show. Even though not a happy ending he succeeded in speaking up and pursuing someone. 

GB was somewhat sly to me, he was honest throughout after he had a date with YJ in ep 4. He also was someone to learn a lot from. Even though YJ was too busy to recognize his effort, he and YJ just like HJ and HW always had fated dates. He had his date as YJ for the 2 major dates but somehow always lost to HW in YJ's Heart. His consistency fits his personality well. And love the bond between DG and GB they are so great... great friendship born in HS2.

JM was just lovely. Jae Ho even though a bit too obsessed with DE he was like MC Yoo Jae Suk for the HS2 housemates. He helped them from the very beginning to loosen up a bit. DE like she said, she goes for the person that is interested in her, I felt sad that she had to suppress her feelings. Liked it though when she confessed to HW in her date. 

The cast members were all great, and each and everyone was really great and the show as well. The twist was so thrilling and I loved it since I always looked forward to the surprise that the housemates would bring us with each week. Hope the members are taken care of by us and I loved each and every one of them... Looking forward to the special episodes which will mark the end... and hope for a more thrilling season 3!!!!!",2018-06-22 03:47:59

This... is a story of the forbidden. 


""Your power is far too outside the Underworld's average, Sirzechs. Such excessive power... The government will no doubt shun you."" **-Zioticus Gremory**

The Underworld lost by the First-Generation Four Great Demon Lords.


""I've heard rumors about you, Grayfia Lucifugus. Which one of us is stronger... I'd like to fight you, just once, to find out."" **-Serafall Sitri**

The energetic successor to the Sitri House- desired strong opponents.


""The fact that you harbor the power of destruction... It's important to me as well, you know? **-Venelana Gremory**

The most outstanding Devil born in the Gremory House's history.


""If you work, you lose. It would be nice if the new Underworld was one where I didn't have to work...""  **-Falbium Glasya-Labolas**

Powerful Devils born unconnected to the Demon Lords' blood ties.


""It won't do for the Demon Lords' kin to lay a hand on Sirzechs. I've got few friends to begin with, you see.""  **-Ajuka Astaroth**

The Astaroth youth who also held a transcendant power.


""Ugh... What a pain. It's been a pain because my old man kicked it."" **-Rizevim Livan Lucifer**

The Underworld of that age held nothing but boredom for him. 


""The power in my body... How can I make it useful to this Underworld...?"" **-Sirzechs Gremory**

A power that long surpassed the Demon Lord's Houses. It grasped the fate of the Underworld.


""Sirzechs, Ajuka, Serafall, Falbium... Devils who surpass the Demon Lords have been born. What steps are there, to prepare Demon Lords fit to rule the new Underworld...?"" **-First-Generation Bael, Zekram Bael**

The young Devils' expectations begin to move in the Underworld lost by the First-Generation.


""They hope to restart the war. They couldn't call it a true victory unless they destroyed Azazel and Michael. No matter how much the commoners decline, as long as the Demon Lords' Houses live on, the Devils' shan't falter."" **-Bidrade Basharn Beelzebub**

The Demon Lord's Houses as long as they remained, it would be fine.


""It seems there's movement among the Devils. Now, this power struggle- will it be the Demon Lords, or their opposers?""  **-Fallen Angel Governor-General, Azazel**

The Fallen Angels who would halve the Underworld had doubts about the changing world of the Devils.


""How dare the likes of a Gremory- approach my older sisteeeerrr!!"" **-Euclid Lucifugus**

A twisted love directed its hatred at Sirzechs. 


*Two hearts fluttered amidst the rebellion against the Houses of the Demon Lords.*


""I am the vanguard of the Lucifers. Above all, that is my duty. Despite that... you would desire me? Sirzechs."" **-Grayfia Lucifugus**

""Yeah, that's right, Grayfia. Because I fell for you at first sight."" **-Sirzechs Gremory**

classic Valve games like Half life, Portal and L4D2 are great. 

Faster Than Light (FTL) is amazing, do not \*not\* play that, its a rogue like strat game set in space, please just have some trust in me and get FTL. 

Magicka is an old game but unique like any other, its a funny little wizard game with LITERALLY thousands of spell combinations that you mash together and blast the shit out of opponents with, its fun and doesnt lose its fun. 

Snake Pass is GREAT its a puzzley kind of game where you are a snake and manuever the snake through obstacles like climbing up scaffolds and shit, its so satisfying i love it and it gives me Banjo Kazooie vibes which is rare (lol rare, get it). 

Subnautica is simply a gem and i personally emailed the devs a few months back just to let them know that they set a great example of what indie devs should be like, AND they emailed me back and said thanks, i got an email from the creative director HIMSELF :D Subnautica is a MUST HAVE.  


witcher 3 because its witcher 3, just, just get it.  


A lesser known game that also gives me banjo vibes is Unbox, its so cute and harmless as a game BUT challenging as all hell! its great in aesthetics and difficulty and design, pre much you are a cube box that goes around FANTASTICALLY designed maps of all kinds (snow, jungle, tropical/etc) and does a variety of fun shit like climbing towers, avoiding traps, fighting enemies, races, finding hidden gems etc, just classic Nintendo style shit.  


Little nightmares is a sidescrolling 3d horror game, so fucking good, seriously just look at it on youtube.  


DOOM 2016 is one of those games that i borrowed off of a friend and downloaded it and thought ""this is gonna suck"" and less than 20 minutes after playing i had the OST downloaded in Spotify and DOOM as my desktop wallpaper, this game is fucking nuts, you just have fun THRASHING enemies with shotguns and chainsaw AND YOUR FISTS and miniguns and rockets and shit, a few finishing moves you can do at your leisure i can think of are: rip a demons leg off then smash his head in with his own leg lol; put your gun away and literally punch a gaping hole through the stomach of a demon; rip the tooth out of a dinosaur demon then shank it in the neck with its own tooth, get a chainsaw out and literally cut demons on half, grab a skeleton demon by its eye sockets and smash its skull into your knee. How does any of that not sell it for you?  


ABZU is like a moving poem/movie/book/game all in one, its an underwater game where you just swim around and look at shit, you cant get hurt or die BUT there were times playing where my heart was fluttering and my eyes watered from the sheer beauty of the games design, look at it on youtube, please.

3346,"Hey, just wanted to share a new repo.

Our challenge was that we wanted to build a Redux app with potentially very large state while constantly saving the state to persist data and track UI changes. For example if a user starts to create a new record and then quits the app we're able to show the partially completed record.

I'm sure there are a ton of ways for the code to be improved. Separating it out from our larger codebase has definitely helped me reason about it.

I'm really enjoying developing with Flutter. I realize Google is promoting the BLoC pattern but Redux seems like a natural fit to me. The polish of the immutable libraries for Dart is really impressive which makes handling immutability a lot easier than it would be otherwise.  

Feedback is appreciated, please be nice :)",2018-06-22 10:37:31

But if you mean hybrid apps like flutter/ionic/reactNative etc?

I am not a crazy fan of the idea... couple reasons:
1) most of the big companies that jumped on that bandwagon are now jumping back out - or they are indeed using the hybrid apps, but only for small portions of their app. The native code is still the powerhouse of their apps.

2) I am in the boat that does not trust all of these crazy libraries/frameworks that are coming out (especially in the JavaScript arena). I feel like as an investment of time, I do not feel called to focus my time on a stack that REALLY may not exist in a year. ",2018-06-22 11:08:46

3352,"My first relationship was with my preist's (Eastern Orthodox) son, who I had been infatuated with since I was 14. I was 17 and he was 16 before his parents allowed him to date me. Things I learned and supporting background story:
1) don't date your priest's son. If you do, find another priest to confess to and receive advice from.
2) both parties should be completely clear on the physical boundaries in the relationship. It seems like this should be taken for granted, I know. When my boyfriend kissed me for the first time, I was all heart flutter and butterflies. We talked on the phone the next day. Then he informed me that his parents didn't allow kissing before engagement, that we ""shouldn't have done that,"" and that we wouldn't be doing it again. The issue here was that I had no idea that his parents did not allow it, and he should have been upfront with me in the beginning instead of allowing me to put him in a potentially compromising situation.
3) there is such a thing as compatibility.
4) I am not compatible with highly conservative men. He had very clear expectations of how a woman should be. I did not meet those expectations, and this frustrated him.
5) following the previous point, you should be able to discuss issues on which you have varying viewpoints. Anytime I would bring up a topic of discussion about which I had an opinion, he would shut down.
6)find someone who has the same idea of what a marriege looks like as you, or better yet, be flexible and find one who is willing to discover that with you. While it is good to know what you think, marriage is one of those things that while there are definitely wrong ways of doing it, there is no one right way of doing it.
7) while a partner having strong connection with their family is a good thing, there are times when it can be out of balance. If they break your trust because they are dependent on their family to function, this is not okay. I will refrain from sharing the story on this one, because I don't want to say anything unfair about anyone. 
8) when you are dating, you're looking for a spouse, not a family to marry into. We spent 95 percent of our time together at his family's house. Family dinners and time together are wonderful and important in relationships, but so is getting to know how your person interacts with you one-on-one. We went out alone together only a handful of times, and it was always super formal and uncomfortable, which leads me to the next point....
9) you should be being spontaneous and HAVING FUN in your relationship. Are they work? Yes. Can some days absolutely suck balls? Yes! That's normal. Problems come up. Irresolvable problems that you have to learn to cope with come up. But ultimately, if when you think about it you are not happy, content, safe, loved, and HAVING FUN in your relationship, find one where you will. Find a person who makes you look at the world differently and want to see things through their eyes, and learn everything about them. Find a person who is willing to make every day an adventure with you, and see you as a partner and an equal, who makes themselves vulnerable and honors that you make yourself vulnerable.
10) if you've been infatuated with someone for 4 years, evaluate to see if you are interested in him as he is now, or if you're still in love with the boy who played the grand piano in the autumn sunlight when you were moving into your new house. People have to grow and change with each other, and sometimes you can fall in love with an idea or a construct rather than an actual person. It is intense, and it feels like living a person, until you love a person.
So to summarize, the main things I learned are to make sure that you love someone for who they are now, don't hold expectations about who they are in the past or who they will be in the future. Maintain your boundaries, and have fun.

Being a Full-Time ASMR YouTuber:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoyNdgeLVvI&t=3055s&frags=pl%2Cwn

  Personal  

Are you friends with a lot of other ASMR creators? Or just work friends?

Why did you listen to ASMR so much in your past?

Is it difficult to make new friends, if you have the time to try, because youre like a semi-famous person?

What is your favourite video of yours and why?

When was the last time you cried, and why?

What would you be doing if money was a non-issue? Like you won a very large prize in a lottery.

If you could make one major change to society/the world, what would that change be? It much be at least somewhat feasible.

What is your definition of happiness?

Do you listen to your own ASMR to help you sleep? Do your real life friends listen to your content?

In your answering personal questions video, you said your backup plan was to be editing commercials. Do you practice or do pet projects to maintain your industry knowledge and skills?

What's your plan for tomorrow's livestream on Twitch?


  Business  

Do you put a substance on your fingers to flutter them with such mastery?

In the early days of your career, did you cringe every time you had to listen to your voice and watch your face, to edit your videos?

What is your process for creating an ASMR video? Is it like writing a story, where you have a beginning, middle, end? Do you build the script based on what you want the audience to experience throughout the video?

Will you make any ASMR music? Like sample ASMR triggers, get a music person to put sampled sounds together nicely, and overlap vocals onto that. But, have a length of 5-10 minutes per song to allow for a smoother transition of triggers so its more asmr-y.

How frequently do you get email message from random people, or Reddit private messages?

What are the most memorable messages you have received from people you have helped?

What are some of the very negative and very positive aspects of being a ASMR creator? Dont spare me the details, I can handle it if you can.

 Do ASMR artists have a definite understanding of what triggers work well, or do you kind of guess what triggers you use in your videos? Gaining an understanding though follower surveys, reading academic research papers, etc.

What were some reality vs. expectations of being an ASMR content creator? I mean maybe you thought a video could be made in a few hours before starting your career, but it takes days, for example. I dont now if thats true, just a random example to help you understand the question.

How did you come about choosing your filler sounds? Fluttering fingers, mouth clicks, etc. All of which I absolutely love.

Where do you get the ideas for your videos from?

Would you rather put all your content on Twitch if YouTube didn't have such the user base?

Also try checking out an ultrasound of a 12-week-old fetus and tell me he/she isnt a human. I gave birth to three children and heard and saw their heartbeats. I saw all three of my children on ultrasound at 20 weeks gestation and they definitely were a human, with hair, eyes, ears, sucking motions, and this:

* Your baby's eyelids close and will not reopen until about the 28th week.
* Baby's face is well-formed.
* Limbs are long and thin.
* Nails appear on the fingers and toes.
* Genitals appear.
* Baby's liver is making red blood cells.
* The head is very large -- about half of baby's size.
* Your little one can now make a fist.
* Tooth buds appear for the baby teeth.
* Your baby can hear.
* The baby is more active and continues to move and float around.
* The mother may feel a fluttering in the lower abdomen. This is called quickening, when mom can feel baby's first movements.
*By the end of this time, baby can swallow.

3409,"> In the early days of your career, did you cringe every time you had to listen to your voice and watch your face, to edit your videos?

Nah. I did a lot of acting and performing my whole life.
> What is your process for creating an ASMR video? Is it like writing a story, where you have a beginning, middle, end? Do you build the script based on what you want the audience to experience throughout the video?

Yes, you nailed it. Beginning middle end for sure. I focus a lot on plot, probably more than I should.
> Will you make any ASMR music? Like sample ASMR triggers, get a music person to put sampled sounds together nicely, and overlap vocals onto that. But, have a length of 5-10 minutes per song to allow for a smoother transition of triggers so its more asmr-y.

I will personally not, but people can use my voice if they want to!
> How frequently do you get email message from random people, or Reddit private messages?

Frequently. :)
> What are the most memorable messages you have received from people you have helped?

People telling me they use my videos to practice eye contact. I was very proud of them. People who tell me I help them in ways that I use ASMR to help me. Very precious to me.
> What are some of the very negative and very positive aspects of being a ASMR creator? Dont spare me the details, I can handle it if you can.

The stalkers. On the other hand, I've made so many amazing friends. I love them. You don't need drama to become popular in ASMR. I actually feel like I help people. Or at at the very least, distract them for a little.
>  Do ASMR artists have a definite understanding of what triggers work well, or do you kind of guess what triggers you use in your videos? Gaining an understanding though follower surveys, reading academic research papers, etc.

It helps that I experience ASMR. I will very rarely do a trigger that doesn't work for me personally. Other people do them better :)
> What were some reality vs. expectations of being an ASMR content creator? I mean maybe you thought a video could be made in a few hours before starting your career, but it takes days, for example. I dont now if thats true, just a random example to help you understand the question.

I didn't know how interested people would become in ME. Pleasantly surprised that people like my personality as well as the sounds. I didn't know that I wouldn't be able to shoot during the day, ever. 
> How did you come about choosing your filler sounds? Fluttering fingers, mouth clicks, etc. All of which I absolutely love.

Natural progression. Karuna Satori heavily influenced my mouth clicks. I ADORE them from her. Tony Bomboni influenced my finger fluttering. Then it became habit :)
> Where do you get the ideas for your videos from?

Some genuinely pop into my head, some I sit down and think purposefully. Some from watching other videos. Some from straightforward requests from comments and Patrons.
> Would you rather put all your content on Twitch if YouTube didn't have such the user base?

Hmmm. I like Twitch better as a company, yes. But I think the massive fanbase makes it very difficult for YouTube to manage, so that's not really fair.
> If you get YouTube analytics data from your channel, what are the ratios of the demographics on your channel? Like ratio by age, sex, age and sex. If its also broken down by video, what are interesting trends you have noticed with demographic breakdown of certain types of videos.

I have about 60/40 male/female viewers. 50% from America. Only 30% of my viewers are actually subscribed. SUBSCRIBE!!!!! Most are 18-28 years old. Ladies LOVE Lorelei. Men love personal attention. Both love sleep triggers.
> How do advertisers find you, or do you find them? I would think asmr is still niche enough where most people dont know about it, including companies.

I just have a marketing email that is managed by someone else. I reach out to very few. It's people's job to find me :)
> I noticed, or maybe you have been doing it for a while and I didnt watch those videos, that you are doing lots of advertising of products in recent videos. What is the reason for the increase in advertising, if there is an increase?

My popularity has had more people reaching out to me with compelling offers. Almost always, I have already used their product so I'm happy to work with them. Otherwise, I am introduced to their product and genuinely like it. Doing product placements for things I don't genuinely support feels icky so I don't. It pays much more than YouTube does. I have a personal pledge to do maximum of 4 a month, so one a week, and two-non sponsored. They rarely affect what I was going to shoot anyway, I just make them work with ideas I already had. Those four sponsored videos pay more than YouTube pay in a month. It helps me pay for things like my editor so I can always have 3 videos a week and stream so often :) This month, I overbooked and have 5, and I feel very guilty about it for some reason.

""Mr. Speaker, tomorrow will mark six months since the arrival of the aliens to our solar system. This week, the vampire dukedoms will play host to the Alien Commonwealth in a meeting with our heads of state. I know this whole House of Uncommons will want to join me, and us, in welcoming these leaders from outer space, who assuredly want nothing except to become part of our ecosystem.""

""Bullshit"", shouted the Werewolf representative, jumping from his chair and pounding on the table with both fists. I noticed significant dents on the hardwood surface.

""Order, order"", I said.

""This is nothing but lies. They are only taking them in because they believe they can be food"".

""Order"", I said louder this time. With a swift movement of my wrist, I sent the werewolf back onto his chair. 

The ghost representative sniggered. I heard her but could barely seem the smile in her translucid face. 

""Continue, please"".

""Over the coming days"", said the vampire representative, ""we will be discussing a range of shared priorities, from food supply to choice of habitat. With the increase of the world population and the emergence of better, and faster, means of communication, the summit will have particular focus in the protection of our existence from humans.""

The vampire sat back down.

""Werewolf nation,"" I said.

The werewolf stood, with clenched fists.

""We should never meet with these aliens. Let alone allow the vampire dukedoms to do it. The whole House is aware of the stories of vampires who have created harvesting camps-""

""That is ridiculous, never has a vampire-""

""Breeding and bleeding humans for decades.""

""An unfounded accusation.""

""You yourself"", he said, pointing a thick finger at the vampire, ""have been acused of absconding while under investigation. But you are lucky as I am sure this House was very quick to dismiss the charges under this new threat"".

""Order, you two. The dukedoms are not on trial here today,"" I said.

We should kill them. The whole lot of them. This aliens are nothing but a threat to our existence. They have already been the cause of panic when one of their ships spread panic among the population.

They were also very quick to misdirect their attentions.

Shut up, said the werewolf. I have family. Human family. Grandchildren and grand-grandchildren that have lived long and peaceful lives under my kinds watch. I will not allow this ones greediness to cause my people any pain.

I shifted in my chair, realizing I had sat on a wing and made it all crooked. I cursed under my breath. Very well. Touching words. Now, for the representative of the ghost populace, if you please.

The ghost stood up, or at least she floated a bit higher above the ground. She was still smiling a very odd, uncomfortable smile.

What do the Fairies think?

Excuse me?

Do you like these aliens?

Here are gathered here today to discuss the alien integration or annihilation. Not if I have particular feelings towards them.

The ghost smiled. She was becoming less and less translucid as time passed.

A little bird  told me you have been making deals, she sang as the smile grew larger.

What? The werewolf sprung from the chair again. He really liked doing that.

I lifted two hands placatingly. No one is making deals with the aliens.

You sneaky, scheming, untrustworthy freaking fairy, the werewolf shouted. Oh dear, I thought has his feature became more feral.

I leaped from the chair, with my fluttering wings taking out of reach of the crazed representative. Werewolves and vampires never got along. Its simply the way of things. One kind guards whole families of humans, the other kind eats them almost indiscriminately. But fairies, yeah, no one likes us.

Calm yourself, representative. We are gathered here today-

He flipped the table towards me and failed for a meter.

Under the principles of equality to discuss a common issue. Do not let your strong emotions get the better of you, Mr. Representative.

The truth was we sure as hell made a deal with the Aliens. 

He charged at me and, well, I did what I had to do. I flickered past him, grabbed him by the scruff of the neck and sent him crashing towards the window.

When I peeked outside, there was no body splattered on the floor. As I expected.

The vampire representative was placing the table back on its place. Shall we finish the debate? I believe the departure of our colleague leaves the vote towards allowing the alien to enter the planet peacefully. Correct, Mr. Keeper?

Lets see what our ghost representative has to say.

The ghost approached the table.

Unless she plans to throw more meaningless accusations.

She smiled. The possible overcrowding as a result of a violent alien invasion is our main concern. More and more the prices of cemetery real estate are rising to impossible levels for our people. A grand majority have been forced to migrate to the periphery, because the prices practiced in the city are insurmountable. The reality is that there are no more quality cemeteries for my kin to haunt.

The vampire scoffed. Thats it? 

She shrugged and her smile vanished. Youll all be ghosts one day. Then, youll see.

3425,"No, not entirely.

A huge part of language (read: verbal communication) is intonation. Its not enough to just say the words like a robot, you have to intonate them properly. 

If you made a language out of humming, the only cues you would have for communication would be intonation, presence of sound, absence of sound and the pacing of those changes. 

For people like me with thought disorders causing my speech impediments, this system is already being attacked at every link, because every combination of sounds you make are done with intention, meant to be interpreted in their proper context. 

If I cannot keep a hold of my intentions when I speak, I would devolve into incoherence just the same as I already do.

Some things, like lisps and Walue versus Value would go, but jittery vocal chords, or a fluttering diaphragm (the muscle in the torso that controls your lungs) would persist.

Then the bird stood on a wooden beam and began whistling, a nice little whistle that I enjoyed. When I stared at him and whistled back... The bird looked strange at me. He whistled for a little while, flew around and left, thats when I felt the spirit of Milton Friedman. I felt him there, like he was giving us his blessing, saying: Today the battle starts. Go to the victory. Defeat the fascist SOMC. Downvote the DT. You have our blessings.

I still do things like going to work and grocery shopping and cleaning and stuff, but its harder than it really should be. 

I also have anxiety, which more or less just feel like a fluttery feeling in my entire body and like my mind is racing.

3438,"I think it really depends on whether you want your app to look different on iOS than on Android or the same across both. There is no rule that says you have to use iOS style controls on iOS and Android / Material controls on Android. Likewise, there is nothing that says you cannot use Material on both platforms. It's up to you as the designer.

Flutter doesn't wrap iOS and Android native controls for this very reason. It's about creating a UI/design that meets your requirements and what looks good to you.

For instance, if you have a button that has text and solid border (common on both) then you could probably easily use the material controls and create a \`MyButton\` (or whatever) widget that allows for easy re-use. The tricky part is how much you want to nuance this. 

An example of this is: I want a button that looks the same on iOS and Android but has an ink-style splash on Android and not on iOS? If so, then you will need to do some custom logic and make a button widget to meet those requirements. The good news is that you only need to do it once. That's just how it goes :)",2018-06-22 22:08:22

3460,"Ask yourself about the biases that might be driving this series of automatic thought-reaction, reactive emotional states, or behaviors.  It starts with the admission that you're nervous, that you overthink, so good first step.  But now, it's about how you think about, how you choose to perceive basic information, whether it relates to the aforementioned, or whether it relates to the ""subject"" you're speaking to.

In short, they're just people.  Not any different than talking to dudes.  Be engaged, be interested, enjoy the little flutters of nervousness and awkwardness.  Even if you think you don't see them differently, what purpose would there be in ""overthinking"", if you weren't dealing with a slew of concepts.  Concepts, like, entitlement, expectations, self-image and self-worth.  Demystify women by seeing them as what they are - they have dreams, experiences, perspectives, their own biases and flaws, etc., that make them worthwhile.  Not more worthwhile than, say, you, uninteresting, plain, a bore, a nervous wreck, or any number of harmful self-statements that you might tell yourself, even unconsciously, quietly.

Still, projecting confidence is important as part of self-actualizing.  Whatever it is you're overthinking, remember to demystify them.  It's the conceptual floor model for ""picture everyone naked"".  Realize they're vulnerable, strong, confused, certain, wise, impatient, awkward, self-absorbed, un-empathetic, too empathetic, etc.  They're just people.  They're interesting af, and it behooves you to learn how to listen comfortably, then respond meaningfully.

Always be honest; at times be vulnerable; be diplomatic about challenges to their base stance on things, especially if you feel differently.  Never devalue their opinion or perspective, instead investigate further if you aren't relating. 
 Why do they feel that way?  Respect both the people who don't know, as well as the people who are willfully ignorant to something integral to your own thoughts on the issue; don't talk too much about yourself, but definitely talk about all the things you're interested in.  Asking questions that are stimulating, that dig a little deeper, is paramount, so part of processing and being a quality communicator, is knowing how to remain interested purely because they're interested.  You're consuming how they think about things, their chosen memories and shared experiences, their anxieties, their ambitions, what makes them think they're on the way to being the best version of themselves.

No need to overthink it because they're just people, they're already interesting af.  I had a similar over-exalting view of women starting out, and really, they are worthy of praise, non-judgment, understanding, respect, etc.  But they aren't more valuable than you because they're desired ""objects"", learn to appreciate the fundamental attributes of who you are, and hold them up side-by-side.  Realize, they're not as different or as beguiling as you think.  Just people.  Good luck :)",2018-06-23 01:38:53

3464,"Hi there, not previous poster, but just to maybe illuminate a few things for you. 

You are possibly being downvoted because it is generally considered bad manners to critique a critique. One of those things, I'm afraid. It makes it look like you didn't really come here accept criticism but to just defend your choices, expecting only praise. I'm sure it's entirely not the case, but defending your work in this way can have a detrimental effect. Sadly, when people critique a critique, it puts those people off critiquing again, as they are just giving their honest opinion after being asked for it. Perhaps you are not familiar with critiquing etiquette? It's generally expected to take critique as well as possible as we all appreciate the time people take to give us their time and advice.

There is no expectation to take it or apply it. But receiving it gracefully is just good manners.

And this is where I have to say common contemporary advice disagrees with some points you've raised. 

If you have been advised that using a variety of dialogue descriptors is 'professional', you have been misinformed. I'm afraid it is actually considered the sign of an amateur these days. You can have a browse at r/writing on that topic if you like. It has been my experience that most people over there, who represent a variety of writing levels and writing professions recommend using anything other than 'said' very sparingly. You can read why for yourself.

I totally agree with /u/pushkar000 regarding your sentence structure and length. You do have some problems that I think you cannot ignore. You are quite right that they are not arbiter of quality, but they can very easily indicate the opposite. Length of sentence is generally all about rhythm and pace. People tend to suggest reading your longer sentences out loud if you are unsure. 

>Like the scraps of clothing and gold pennants afloat in the wreckage, the grey crests of the Farnelle family, their exteriors bitten by arrows and fire, fluttered and gripped against heavy winds thick with ash.

This one - pushing it on the breath test, I'm afraid. The problem is too much imagery. too swiftly presented. By the time I've got to the end, I have forgotten what the beginning was. It's not just, boom, boom, boom - it's boomboomboomkitchensinkflappingwreckagewinds.  For me to hold this in my head and visualise it, I've got scraps of clothing in the wreckage *and* pennants, I'm busy trying to figure out what you mean by 'exteriors bitten by arrows and fire', 'exteriors', being a poor word choice as it would be difficult to damage the 'interior' or a fabric pennant, but maybe you mean the 'crest', I'm not sure... because they seem to be in the wreckage but then they are fluttering in the ashey heavy winds... Overblown, muddy imagery, mate. Muddy.

And it is muddy because you have crammed it all in one sentence. Because there are good images in there. You need to let them breathe. They are suffocating.

>Keeping a reader interested is vital, 

It is, but overloading the reader with imagery is not the way to go. You need to give a reader space to digest, absorb and visualise your imagery, in order for it to have a lasting impact. 

>...but I will not demean somebodys intelligence by watering down vocabulary or, indeed, simplifying syntax without justification. 

Sigh. Every writer has a different style and you will find yours. But if you go into this thinking simplistic prose is demeaning anyone's intelligence, well, my own qualifications and experience which I won't bore you with, but will provide if necessary, are telling me you are just plain wrong. 

There is always justification to consider simplifying syntax if your meaning is unclear and convoluted. Because comprehension is your aim. No, it does not mean 'watering down vocabulary', it means not bombarding your reader with how wide it is. Readers like to read. They don't mind stopping every now and then to check a new word or two to learn, or clarify meaning, but they also do not like being talked down to. And overusing vocabulary can appear to be doing this. Because a wide vocabulary is not necessarily a sign of intelligence. It is merely a sign of a good memory, which may be part of intelligence, or not. Depending how you define intelligence.

I write simple prose. Not because I have a limited vocabulary, or dismiss anyone's intelligence, but because I want to appeal to everyone who can read and not make the reader feel they need a dictionary by their side, while they do so. Simple words have power. They can be as evocative and immersive as the talent of the person who wields them can create.

> It is funny, because the sentence you highlighted as being the best is the one I thought was the worst. 

I think this sentence sums up what your problem might be. You've come here for critique, from others, and to comment on that. Not to just share your own opinions of your work. If you have fixed ideas about yours, it will never improve, and if you spend too much time defending it, you will never attract honest and useful critique.

>To me, it seemed clich, a shallow attempt to grab a readers attention by simply stating a character trait rather than demonstrating it. Trite! 

Yet at the same time you leave me wondering. If you believe this sentence to be trite, why have you not edited it, or removed it completely??

But you are right about one thing, good discussion! :)",2018-06-23 02:05:35

3466,"Tim had started the day perfectly happy, he planned to be half in the bottle by noon, and fully in by sundown. The sun, it was high, probably wasn't that far past noon, he was of schedule.

Startlingly, teeth achingly sober he made his way through streets of the Vegas slums. Formally the Vegas strip after judgement day the world changed, the boss thought that a place of 'indulgence' like the strip should be used for a batter purpose.

Tim's heart ached, once there would have been rivers of booze, flying from the taps of eager money grubbing good for nothings willing to serve and ask questions later.

The child he was told to follow had run ahead and was standing in front of an open door. The buildings in this part of the slum  were two stories, one ramshackle death trap atop another.

As Tim approached the door, the worried look of the child was accompanied by a foul smell. Giving Tim an odd mixture of pity and disgust. His stomach turned as he entered after the child.

A man lay on his back covered in sheets. The sheets were littered with the detritus of human life. Every conceivable fluid lay somewhere on sheets. Tim stomached the scene silently praying to be struck drunk by the heavenly father, the thought of prayer drew a cynical smile from Tim, he quickly stifled the smirk, now was not the time.

Tim sat down next to the man, noticing for the first time that it was a woman, her head was shaved and she was clearly in some stage of malnutrition. Tim's stomach turned not at the sight, but at the circumstances, how had it got this bad? Where had it all gone wrong? Oh. Now he remembered.

The child threw some dollar bills Tim's way. He was pleading, Tim knew he couldn't understand the child but everything came so clear ""Save her"". Tim couldn't think who might have let it slip but he could save this women, it would take less than a second.

But they were too close. One extra once of power and they would sniff him right out.

The women's eyes lazily opened, she had been unconscious since Tim had arrived. She saw the child screaming, her hand raised to the child's head, quieting him, her other hand reaching for Tim's. Tim took her hand, she squeezed his hand, so weak, but fighting.

Tim saw her eyes, and in them a sliver of something old and yet so young.

Tim sighed, knowing a deep part of him had already made a decision before he had even seen the women. Tim let go of her hand, standing to his full height, his head just touching the roof, a full 7 feet, he always tried to slouch the height really gave a it away.

He removed his coat, his shawl, boots, everything. Standing in his his underwear he relaxed. He let old bones set into place, his shoulders tingled with a familiar pattern. His bones sang.

His back exploded, shards of light firing out in all directions.

Tim inhaled, drawing the light back in. The shards swam through the air, reluctantly forming into two sets of wings.

The child flung himself between the women and Tim. His eyes red from crying, jaw clenched in anger. No fear, just hatred. Now Tim could see it all, the swirling pool of color around the boy, emotions, mixing into a rainbow soup.

The mothers emotions were more subdued, there were hints of anger, but none directed at Tim, just her condition. Tim raised a hand, putting on his best compassionate smile, he was really bad at those, a spike of mistrust in the boy assured him he was still terrible. Distrust, a lime green, oddly pretty.

His hand shone for a brief second, the light vanishing as quickly as it came. Tim kept his hand out staring at it. he was transfixed, he had forgotten just how white it got.

The room was silent, except for the boys muffled snarls. The atmosphere built until a wet cough shattered it. The boy leaped in surprise looking down in amazement at the women. Time knew now that she was his mother, he had assumed before, now he could see the ties, little red strings, wound in a pattern that could only mean motherhood.

The women sat up feeling her arms and chest, they had been weakened to the point of complete deterioration, now they sat plump and strong. Her eyes welled with tears, she grabbed the boy holding him in what must have been their first hug in a long time, the colors that pulsed from the pair gave Tim chills, his heart and soul ached at the sight.

She stood, Tim reached an arm out for support. She did not need it, but took it once she was steady. Looking Tim in the eyes, a brave feet considering angels of his rank had eyes that could literally kill. But all he felt from her was love. The magenta haze that was lifting from her skin made Tim more than a little uncomfortable. She held onto Tim despite his slight attempt to let go of her. ""Thank you"" her words were brief, the weight of them hitting Tim for six, a century of isolation, of serfdom, helping where he could hoping to not be discovered, it all felt worth it.

He departed from the shack, feeling the beating presence outside driving his heart into an anxious flutter.

3475,"You can achieve the native look in react native. If you work hard and optimize your app well you can achieve near native feel and performance in react native.

If you are building a material design app or one with a custom design flutter is a great option. And it has really great performance if you build the app in right way. I would say it can perform better than android native java apps.

We built a react native app but we had to make changes for both platforms. There were lot of Platform.OS switches. Now we are building a flutter app and we haven't written a single switch. It's all because flutter does the rendering all by itself. And there are many other things good about flutter.

May be you should try both and see which one fits for your use case.",2018-06-23 03:40:27

3486,"""Come on Bill! You promised we'd do it this weekend!""

Bill sighed at the sight of his girlfriend Stephanie's big brown eyes looking up at him.

""Alright,"" he agreed.

She squealed and hopped up. ""It's my turn this time.""

He watched as she undressed excitedly. Stephanie was a short, slender young woman who would have made an ideal image in a dictionary of the word ""petite"". Her skin was soft and pale, and she wore her brown hair cut short in a bob.

""God! I get so wet when we do this!"" Her words were emphasized by her hand stroking her freshly trimmed crotch.

Bill followed suit and removed his clothes; they went into the bedroom of their small apartment.

""Ready?"" Stephanie could not hide her eagerness.

His cock twitched at the sight of her nudeness. What he really wanted was to toss her on the bed and make love to her, but he had promised.

She stretched out on the bed. ""I'm ready!""

Bill settled on the edge of the bed and lifted her foot with its freshly painted pink toenails. She giggled when he kissed them and wiggled; Stephanie was very ticklish. Then he opened his mouth and shifted it from side to side causing the jaw to unhinge which allowed it to open further. He drew in a large breath to fill his lungs. Then he swallowed her foot.

""Oh god!"" His girlfriend gasped. Her hand rubbed her clitoris, and he wondered if she would orgasm before they finished.

When her leg was almost down to her knee, she lifted her other leg and placed her foot next to his mouth. Bill felt it slide in next to her other.

The human body was much more pliable than it had been. It could be stretched to unbelievable sizes without damage. One advantage was the ability to hold your breath for over an hour at a time and to go days without food or water. But people like Stephanie had discovered other, more exotic advantages.

She wiggled until her legs were inside him up to her knees. The sensation of being stretched like this had taken some getting used to. His girlfriend was breathing heavy, and her nipples stood out. Carefully she shifted from side to side and squirmed as if putting on a tight skirt. The next part was the most unpleasant - her hips.

""Shit! Don't do that!"" She panted trying to fit her hips into his mouth. Bill took the opportunity to lick her crotch as it slowly entered. ""Stop it! I'll cum!""

Of course he could not reply. His stomach bulged unnaturally, and he watched the shape of her feet push out. Then her hips were in, and Stephanie was inside up to her armpits. Bill lay on his back and watched in the mirror as she held her arms over her head and pulled herself in so that only her head remained out.

Stephanine opened her mouth and took a large breath before sliding in. Her arms slid down his throat, and he could breath again. It took some effort to sit up on the bed with his stomach holding a 98 pound woman in it.

She was motionless save for a slight fluttering. That would be her hand working its magic between her legs. His own cock ached and jutted out hard as a stone. He was uncertain why doing this was so arousing though Stephanie definitely like it more than he did.

With the bulk it was impossible for him to masturbate.

There was a rattle at the front door, and Bill realized in a panic that he had forgotten to lock it. He tried to stand and almost fell in an attempt to close the bedroom door.

""Oh shit!,"" came a woman's voice. ""Is she really in there?""

Bill groaned at the sound of Claire's voice. She was Stephanie's best friend.

Claire eyed him and his massive abdomen. Her hand caressed his stomach feeling the woman inside, and her eyes took in his erection.

""What's it feel like,"" Claire asked.

""Weird,"" he answered and watched as Stephanie shifted inside.

""She said it's really hot. I mean sexy hot. Being inside.""

He felt a push and knew his girlfriend was ready. Laying back, Bill tried relax as Stephanie's hands and arms emerged. 

""Hey Claire,"" she said when her head came out.

The two chatted as if it were perfectly normal for Stephanie to be climbing out of Bill. When she was finally out, her body was slick with the slime that coated the inside of the digestive tract.

The two women eyed him, and he realized that this was not a chance encounter.

""Would you like to try,"" Stepahnie asked her friend a bit too innocently.

""Now wait,"" Bill exclaimed. Claire was taller and a bit on the chubby side.

""At least try,"" Stephanie pleaded.

The pair did not wait. Claire undressed and climbed on the bed. This was obviously planned out.

It took longer, and Bill was more than a little uncomfortable when Claire's hips and bigger breasts entered. He lay on his back breathing hard when she finally settled in.

Stephanie grinned and stroked his erection making him groan.

""How's that feel,"" she teased.

He had to admit it was amazing. Claire inside and Stephanie outside.

She straddled his legs and pushed the bulk at his waist forward enough so she could slide him into her. Her hands caressed his stomach softly while moving up and down his shaft.

""I'm... I'm going to... Oh... Oh!""

Warm seed spurted into his girlfriend's body. She continued her rocking until the last of it was released, and his manhood grew soft. Then she stretched out next to him studying his waist where Claire still moved about. Bill closed his eyes and focused on the strange sensations filling his body. Soon the sounds of soft snoring filled his ears, and he saw that Stephanie had dozed off with her hand resting on his stomach. Even Claire had stopped wiggling; perhaps she had fallen asleep? Bill closed his eyes and began to drift.",2018-06-23 05:19:22

The first priority at FB for React Native is to make it work for their own internal projects and use cases -- mostly that just means marketplace for now. React Native as an open source project is a secondary or tertiary concern for them, and it shows. It hasn't been a very healthy open source project for a while. Flutter is definitely prioritizing this higher and it shows.

i am hopeful that this will get somewhat better for RN with sophie alpert shifting more of her attention to the react native project.

if you know js/react, then react native is the right choice. especially if your project is for ios and you have a mac. the number one issue for react native is that it's very ios/mac centric. most of the problem you will encounter is because you are using android and/or windows.

What I'd personally also add is the audio quality, the turbo spool, the flutter, the whine from superchargers, the very distinct sound an engine such as a V8, etc... All these are big focuses imo in an arcade game such as Nfs, it was made decent in 2015 (the stu stu stu was so great) but seemed to kind of disappear in Payback.
Which brings me to my next point, car noise needs to be dependent on the upgrades it has, I WANT TO HEAR IT, straight pipes on a v12 I want to hear it, put a bigger turbo on I want to hear it, as a player, not only do I want to see the difference in performance I want to feel it and to hear it.
The upgrades: first drop the cards, it was terrible, never have that again it sucks horribly. I would like to see some pictures of what I'm putting on my car, in 2015 for instance you had actual pictures of tires or rollcage etc... I want to see the upgrades, want normal tires? Here's what it looks like. Upgrade it to semi slick ones, here's what it looks like, upgrade to full slick?

(this is a crosspost from the Mobius website)

Hello everyone!

Before we get into our development update, wed like to recap our E3 experience.

E3 Recap

We won one of the Rock Paper Shotguns Editors Choice Award 2018 and received two nominations from Game Informer for Best in Show 2018 and PC Gamer for Best of E3 2018.

Thank you to all of you who made it out to E3 and for all the enthusiastic responses to everything we show!


Before our Twitch segment at E3.

For those curious, here are links the various articles that mention Outer Wilds from E3:

Outer Wilds Gameplay Demo - E3 Live 2018
Top Ten of E3: Rock Paper Shotgun
Outer Wilds: Rock Paper Shotgun Article
The Best Indie Games of E3: Game Informer
10 Best Games of E3: Paste
Top Ten Games of E3: Arstechnica

What is the Actual Release Date?

While we havent announced a specific day or month yet, we will definitely be releasing Outer Wilds in 2018. The crazy date listed on the Xbox One store was the result of placeholder shenanigans. Let us reassure you that you wont need to employ the services of a cryostasis lab to get your hands on a copy of Outer Wilds.

Giants Deep: Visual Effects (VFX)

From the outset we knew Giants Deep would be our most visual effects (VFX) heavy planet. As a gas giant with an ocean that is dotted with tornadoes that send islands flying, Giants Deep was our testing ground for developing and refining many of the VFX techniques that we use throughout the game.

The first and largest feature of Giants Deep is its various layers of atmosphere. At its outermost layer, Giants Deep uses the same atmosphere shader as Timber Hearth, with different settings to reflect its non-breathable atmosphere. Below that is a thick swirling layer of clouds, created with multiple overlapping textures to create the churning effect, with special rotating spiral caps on the poles. To add to the stormy nature of the planet, we created a dynamic heat lightning generator that spawns randomized chains of lights inside the cloud layer. This was made translucent so that the lightning shows up brighter in the areas where the clouds are thinnest.


Lightning arcs through the clouds of Giants Deep.

Dotted across the surface of the ocean are the wandering tornadoes that form Giants Deeps complex physics system. As the tornadoes wander, they will toss islands (or the player) into orbit, where they will float in Zero G before plummeting back down through the clouds. It was important for us that these tornadoes all look unique, so we created a system of joints for each tornado that each move in randomized circular patterns, much like a sand pendulum. We also created volumes at the base of each tornado that modify the height map of the ocean so that the water is pulled visually into the cyclones.


A field of wandering tornadoes.

In addition to the massive structural elements like the clouds, ocean and cyclones, there are a number of other effects that help to sell the physical nature of the stormy surface. There is a rain system that dots the players helmet visor with refractive water droplets and streams that respond differently based on whether you look up at the sky, drop your head down, or dunk under water. There are leaves fluttering on the wind that intensify when a tornado is near. Finally, we created massive, complex splash meshes so that when an island crashes from space we have an appropriately large scale effect to signal the impact.


An island dropped into the sea of Giants Deep.

The underwater layer of Giants Deep also contains a variety of challenging visual effects problems, but those secrets must remain hidden until you explore them for yourself!

Thats the End of This Update

Join us in another two weeks for another development update. Have a great weekend everyone!

Cheers,

Mobius

3512,"I've been doing a series on Instagram, where I heavily score music to gifs from the internet. For me, this gif was about taking something quintessentially 80's and twisting it, so I took a similar approach with the music.

I went about making a fast paced 80's inspired track. LinnDrum with gated reverb on the snare, Juno106, and guitars. The chord progression (vi - V - IV - Iaug) has an augmented chord at the turnaround which probably isn't super 80's, but this sort of ties in with taking the 80's and warping it. 

To distort it into a weirder realm, I slowed the track down in Ableton to give it a chopped and screwed vibe (this is why I chose to write at a faster BPM than I would have otherwise). I ran this through a Roland RE-201 Space Echo. The device itself is old and eratic, but I accentuated that characteristic by wobbling the repeat rate knob while the audio signal was hitting tape. This constantly changed the tape speed while recording back into Ableton and introduced wow and flutter. I did this twice and panned each mono signal hard left and hard right to make a fake stereo tape print. As expected, it got slightly phasey, since the playback speed was constantly shifting around, but that ties in kind of nicely with the disturbing imagery, no? I mixed this print in with the pre-tape audio. I lost some low end after going through tape, but I think it was worth it for the vibe that it brought. 

Let me know what you think. Happy to answer some questions! ",2018-06-23 11:43:00

The chain. 1)BYOC The Mimosa - compressor to tame the playing 2) BYOC classic overdrive - tube screamer clone with nice crunch. I also own the OD-2, which is more versatile, but I seem to prefer the classic overdrive sound. 3) BYOC Large Beaver - Big Muff clone. I added a just touch of fuzz on the lead guitar that comes in a little later. Traynor is a Canadian amp company that I think is underrated. Its not too expensive and has a clean, sweet Fender-like tone.

I felt baby at 14w exactly (FTM) But know of plenty who were closer to 20w.

When you lie down in bed tonight, lay on your back, lights off, phone down and just concentrate! You might be feeling little flutters and not even realise it!

The best description I read that describes the early movement perfectly, is imagine a goldfish in a bag of water, gently nudging at the bag, the first few weeks of movements are that gentle and subtle. When you lay down at night baby generally wakes up as you moving through the day rocks them to sleep, just give yourself time, every baby and every body is different.

Does anyone here have a sense for this? 

It would seem that Google would naturally be more interested in the wider community because it benefits their Android platform to have great apps developed there at the same time as iOS apps. Whereas I get the impression that Facebook developed React for themselves and shared it with the community and so they prioritize issues that affect them rather than the community at large.

3528,"**Prompt 6** Modern Day Freeform

Solona Goes to College - Part 2 (Part 1 is [here](https://ft.reddit.com/r/dragonage/comments/8rjbvg/spoilers_alloctime_to_be_storytellers_the_dragon/e0s15gj/))

Credit to /u/zinjadu and /u/Toshi_Nama for Sten the art professor.

*****

Solona struggled down the library stairs, clutching her pile of books. The Magic section was on the upper floor, and ordinarily she would have stayed there to work. But there were only a few free seats today, all of them on the ground floor. She reached the bottom of the staircase, puffing slightly, and let the books fall on to the nearest desk with a satisfying thump.

A little light reading?

She looked up to see Alistair watching her, one eyebrow raised and the hint of a smile on his lips. Indeed, she replied. This should be just about enough to keep me occupied until dinner.

Alistair laughed and glanced at the books. Most of them were Herbalism textbooks that even Solona found dry and uninteresting, but she saw his gaze linger on one particular title.

*The First Blight: A History*? Why are you reading that?

I just thought it would be good to have at least some idea of what I'm in for in three years' time.

Alistair's eyes widened. You don't think there'll be a Blight, do you? There hasn't been one in  what  four hundred years?

And so we must be due one at some point. She chewed her lower lip anxiously. I hope there isn't a Blight. I would be useless. I don't know why they picked me in the first place. I don't know the first thing about fighting anything, let alone fighting darkspawn.

You think I do? Alistair snorted. Watch me kill the darkspawn with the power of my terrible jokes! I'll have them cowering in fear!

Shhh! said an annoyed voice.

Solona felt a giggle rise in her throat and quickly covered her mouth with her hand to muffle the sound. She could see laughter in Alistair's eyes too, although he also seemed surprised about something. Surprised, and pleased.

Do you fancy a walk around the gardens? he asked in a quieter tone. I think you deserve a break.

I'd love to, but I can't. She glanced at the pile of Herbalism books with a sinking heart. Suddenly she couldn't think of anything less enjoyable than spending an afternoon reading about health poultices. I have so much work to do for my next class and

Just a few minutes? Alistair pleaded. I feel like I haven't seen you in weeks, and now I know why. It's because you're always working. You can't work all the time, you'll make yourself crazy.

But

The young man is right, said a gentle but firm voice behind her, and she turned around to see Wynne standing at the bottom of the staircase. You need to take a break every now and then, otherwise you'll burn yourself out, the professor continued. Spending a few minutes in the gardens won't do any harm.

See? Alistair grinned triumphantly.

Well, alright then. She still felt a small pang of guilt when she looked at the books, but if Wynne said it was okay... Let's go!

*****

Autumn had come to Denerim. A thick carpet of leaves covered the grass, swirling around their feet as they walked. There was still some warmth in the air, though, and the gardens were full of students making the most of the last few days of sunshine.

So, about the Grey Wardens, Alistair said, as they wandered across the lawn. Why do you think they chose us?

I have no idea, Solona admitted. But we've all been chosen for a reason. That's what Duncan said in the induction.

That's true. Alistair still sounded uncertain. What did you think of Duncan?

I rather liked him. He seemed trustworthy. But also tough. I bet he knows a thing or two about fighting darkspawn.

Alistair nodded and smiled. I bet he does. 

They had almost reached the middle of the lawn when they came across a very tall easel with an even taller man standing behind it. He had long silver hair and an intense look in his dark eyes that Solona found even more striking than his height.

Who's that? she whispered.

Oh that's Professor Sten, Alistair replied. He's one of the few Qunari professors here. I often see him painting in the gardens. His students love him because he gives out cookies in all his classes.

Solona chuckled. Perhaps I should suggest that to Wynne. Something in the grass caught her eye, and she bent down to pick up a paintbrush. Excuse me? she said, turning to the Qunari. Is this yours? I found it on the ground. Your painting is wonderful, by the way. She knew very little about art, but even she could see that it was an excellent likeness of one of the college buildings.

You have my thanks. Professor Sten accepted the paintbrush with a cool nod before returning his attention to his work.

Solona and Alistair walked on through the gardens. Few flowers remained, but some of the hardier plants bore the occasional bloom. Alistair stopped beside a rosebush that still had one perfect red rose. He gazed at the rose for a few seconds, seemingly trying to make up his mind about something, before suddenly reaching out and picking it.

What are you doing? Solona cried. I don't think we're allowed to pick the flowers.

Alistair twirled the stem between his fingers. I probably should have left it alone, but I couldn't. Winter would come, and the cold would just destroy it. It seemed a shame to lose something so beautiful. I wanted to save it.

That's a nice sentiment. She couldn't help but smile.

Here. Alistair held out the rose.

You're giving it to me? she asked in disbelief. What for?

Because in a lot of ways, I think the same thing when I look at you. There was a nervousness in Alistair's eyes that Solona hadn't seen before. I just wanted to tell you what a rare and wonderful thing you are amidst all the... darkness.

Solona's heart began to flutter wildly in her chest as she reached out to take the rose. Alistair held on to it for a little longer than necessary, so that their fingers brushed together, a touch that sent a jolt of electricity down her spine.

Thank you, Alistair. That didn't seem enough. She looked into his warm brown eyes and murmured, I feel the same way about you.

She watched in surprise as a blush crept across Alistair's face. Iuh thank you. He ran a hand through his blonde hair. This was... nice. We should do this again sometime.

She smiled. I'd really like that.

Well, good. I'm glad. I'll come and find you in the library. Alistair gave her a grin and a wave, and then set off across the lawn.

Solona stared after him until he was out of sight, and then shifted her gaze to the rose. *A rare and wonderful thing amidst all the darkness.* Alistair would have his wish, she decided. She opened herself to the Fade and carefully wove a cleansing ward around the rose, nodding in satisfaction as she released the spell. Now the rose would stay perfect forever.

*To be continued...*",2018-06-23 16:02:47

3537,"The bard finished the song. Tilting his head a little he repeated the ballads refrain on his lute, delicately, softly, a single tone higher than the apprentice accompanying him.

No one said a word. Nothing but the subsiding music and the whispering leaves and squeaking boughs of the enormous oak could be heard. Then, all of a sudden, a goat tethered to one of the carts which circled the ancient tree bleated lengthily. At that moment, as if given a signal, one of the men seated in the large semi-circular audience stood up. Throwing his cobalt blue cloak with gold braid trim back over his shoulder, he gave a stiff, dignified bow.

Thank you, Master Jaskier, he said, his voice resonant without being loud. Allow me, Radcliffe of Oxenfurt, Master of the Arcana, to express what I am sure is the opinion of everyone here present and utter words of gratitude and appreciation for your fine art and skill.

The wizard ran his gaze over those assembled  an audience of well over a hundred people  seated on the ground, on carts, or standing in a tight semi-circle facing the foot of the oak. They nodded and whispered amongst themselves. Several people began to applaud while others greeted the singer with upraised hands. Women, touched by the music, sniffed and wiped their eyes on whatever came to hand, which differed according to their standing, profession and wealth: peasant women used their forearms or the backs of their hands, merchants wives dabbed their eyes with linen handkerchiefs while elves and noblewomen used kerchiefs of the finest tight-woven cotton, and Baron Viliberts three daughters, who had, along with the rest of his retinue, halted their falcon hunt to attend the famous troubadours performance, blew their noses loudly and sonorously into elegant mould-green cashmere scarves.

It would not be an exaggeration to say, continued the wizard, that you have moved us deeply, Master Jaskier. You have prompted us to reflection and thought; you have stirred our hearts. Allow me to express our gratitude, and our respect.

The troubadour stood and took a bow, sweeping the heron feather pinned to his fashionable hat across his knees. His apprentice broke off his playing, grinned and bowed too, until Jaskier glared at him sternly and snapped something under his breath. The boy lowered his head and returned to softly strumming his lute strings.

The assembly stirred to life. The merchants travelling in the caravan whispered amongst themselves and then rolled a sizable cask of beer out to the foot of the oak tree. Wizard Radcliffe lost himself in quiet conversation with Baron Vilibert. Having blown their noses, the barons daughters gazed at Jaskier in adoration  which went entirely unnoticed by the bard, engrossed as he was in smiling, winking and flashing his teeth at a haughty, silent group of roving elves, and at one of them in particular: a dark-haired, large-eyed beauty sporting a tiny ermine cap. Jaskier had rivals for her attention  the elf, with her huge eyes and beautiful toque hat, had caught his audiences interest as well, and a number of knights, students and goliards were paying court to her with their eyes. The elf clearly enjoyed the attention, picking at the lace cuffs of her chemise and fluttering her eyelashes, but the group of elves with her surrounded her on all sides, not bothering to hide their antipathy towards her admirers.

The glade beneath Bleobheris, the great oak, was a place of frequent rallies, a well-known travellers resting place and meeting ground for wanderers, and was famous for its tolerance and openness. The druids protecting the ancient tree called it the Seat of Friendship and willingly welcomed all comers. But even during an event as exceptional as the world-famous troubadours just-concluded performance the travellers kept to themselves, remaining in clearly delineated groups. Elves stayed with elves. Dwarfish craftsmen gathered with their kin, who were often hired to protect the merchant caravans and were armed to the teeth. Their groups tolerated at best the gnome miners and halfling farmers who camped beside them. All non-humans were uniformly distant towards humans. The humans repaid in kind, but were not seen to mix amongst themselves either. Nobility looked down on the merchants and travelling salesmen with open scorn, while soldiers and mercenaries distanced themselves from shepherds and their reeking sheepskins. The few wizards and their disciples kept themselves entirely apart from the others, and bestowed their arrogance on everyone in equal parts. A tight-knit, dark and silent group of peasants lurked in the background. Resembling a forest with their rakes, pitchforks and flails poking above their heads, they were ignored by all and sundry.

The exception, as ever, was the children. Freed from the constraints of silence which had been enforced during the bards performance, the children dashed into the woods with wild cries, and enthusiastically immersed themselves in a game whose rules were incomprehensible to all those who had bidden farewell to the happy years of childhood. Children of elves, dwarves, halflings, gnomes, half-elves, quarter-elves and toddlers of mysterious provenance neither knew nor recognised racial or social divisions. At least, not yet.

Indeed! shouted one of the knights present in the glade, who was as thin as a beanpole and wearing a red and black tunic emblazoned with three lions passant.

The wizard speaks the truth! The ballads were beautiful. Upon my word, honourable Jaskier, if you ever pass near Baldhorn, my lords castle, stop by without a moments hesitation. You will be welcomed like a prince what am I saying? Welcomed like King Vizimir himself! I swear on my sword, I have heard many a minstrel, but none even came close to being your equal, master. Accept the respect and tributes those of us born to knighthood, and those of us appointed to the position, pay to your skills!

Flawlessly sensing the opportune moment, the troubadour winked at his apprentice. The boy set his lute aside and picked up a little casket which served as a collection box for the audiences more measurable expressions of appreciation. He hesitated, ran his eyes over the crowd, then replaced the little casket and grabbed a large bucket standing nearby.

3545,"""Whoooa, hey! That can't be good!"" You freeze, one foot on the ground, one still on the descent steps of the plane. Everyone's countdown clock suddenly went to tomorrow the instant your foot touched down on London's turf. You freeze, a little-- just a *little*-- worried about what will happen if you put the *other* foot down.

""Okey dokey"" you say to yourself ""let's see if I can... Just... Carefully... Like... Take that back...""

Gingerly, arms out like a tight rope walker, you try to play your last step off the plane backwards. You wobble a bit and almost fall, but a second later both your shoes are back on the ramp aaaaand... You take a second look through one nervous eye at everyones countdown clocks. You draw a big breath. Back to normal. Whew.

But, you can't help but wonder, what happens if I--

-- you ease one foot back off the steps, and being careful to keep all your weight on your rear leg, so you can take it back right away, you lightly touch the ground. Whoops! Yeah, you yank your foot back again, hot stove style. All the death counters synced back momentarily, to tomorrow, as soon as your toe touched.

The airline staff is starting to give you looks. You ignore em. You chartered the flight, and now you're curious. Was that REALLY *tomorrow's* date?

""Hey Mac"" you shout to the pilot, (although you know his name is actually Bernie) ""What day is it?""

""What day is it sir?""

""Yeah you heard me. What day is it?""

Mac (Bernie) tells you, and with that data firmly in mind, you decide you need one more peek at that mysterious doomdate, just to be sure. You flutter your shoe up, over, out, and down getting just the lightest tap off the pavement. Sure enough all the death numbers flutter with you- tomorrow, then random again, in time with your toe.

""How bout that"" you say. You try again, with the other foot this time. Shazam! ""Look at that,"" you say ""Bam! I'm killing you. Bam! I'm saving you! Bam, I'm killing you! Bam, saving you! Bam!Bam! Heheh! This is kinda fun!""

Then you get an idea. It seems brilliant. 

""Hey Mac, what *TIME* it is?""


""What *Time* it is, boss?"" inquires Max (Bernie). He keeps the weariness out of his voice almost completely.

""Yeah Mac, what time is it?""

He tells you the time.

""Its *SHOW TIME*!!"" you tell him, and with just the slightest eyeroll, Mac hits it-- your favorite dance track-- *In the Night, Pet Shop Boys*-- (hey he's getting paid) and with one foot on the plane and one foot on the ground, you dance, shimmy and get your funk on, as London dies and rises again around you, to the beat.

3550,"\>Does the readme not clearly communicate the disadvantages of Redux?

No, I can see the disadvantages of Redux. I think your readme does a good job pointing them out. So does trying to learn both Redux and Flutter at the same time. Had I used Redux in the past, jamming the square peg in wouldn't seem so onerous. 

I'm hesitant to shift my code to a new state management package when a big part of the advantage would be to cut down on boilerplate code that's mostly written. I've got so much else to learn about within Flutter, and state management is foundational. Can't really go far without picking one and going. I'd like a 1-year time machine to see what's going to be most used. 

One thing that really struck me is how compact your library is. I like simple and compact. ",2018-06-26 12:52:17

3553,"Delay is my favorite effect category, so this might be a long answer... There are plenty of delays I don't like or don't work for me personally, but these remain my favorites for various reasons.

1. **Strymon El Capistan**: My favorite tape echo emulation, plus there are so many cool tricks you can do with it. Beautiful modulated repeats, lofi tape artifacts, and so much more.
2. **EHX DMM**: Classic modulated analog delay. It's voiced brighter than most other BBD units and can be prone to noise, but the vibrato-laced repeats sound fantastic.
3. **Zoom MultiStomp**: I'm a fan of many of its delay models, but the Lofi and DualDigiD are among my favorites. They are the foundation for many emulations I've made. The lofi sounds very similar to the same mode on the Timeline which it is based on, although with less control (no modulation or grit controls). Bitcrushed echoes are fun and you can also dial in normal delays with warmer qualities by messing with the sample and bit rate  controls. The DualDigiD is an Eventide emulation, but I use it to replicate the Strymon DIG, particularly setting the delay times to the Golden Ratio. Its filter and modulation controls also allowed me to do a reasonable facsimile of my El Capistan and DMM.
4. **Digitech Digidelay**: My first delay that I chose over the Boss DD-3 and DD-6 back in the day. The tape mode provided more warmth than the percussive Boss-style delays and the modulation mode was a big plus (it can also make whale/siren sounds!). The looper is known for its glitchy capabilities and is a lot of fun.
5. **Ibanez DE-7**: The echo mode on this pedal seeks to emulate a tape echo, but I think it's more BBD-voiced. Nevertheless, it is one of the best delays I've used for edge of oscillation sounds. It's an instant wash of sound that never gets out of control if you don't want it to.
6. **Line 6 Echo Park**: Contrary to Line 6 saying this is based on the DL4, the analog and tape algorithms are different--they are much better. Angelo from Meris and Jeorge Tripps crafted some great sounds in this thing. The analog mode, while darker than a DMM, is detailed and the vibrato sounds lush. The tape mode has random crinkle that cannot be dialed out in addition to its wow & flutter modulation.
7. **Strymon Timeline**: Super versatile. It does the DMM thing quite well on its dbucket mode, which is something that many superdelays didn't do well enough for me. The dual and lofi modes are great, and the tape mode is good too--although it sounds different from the El Capistan, even on single-head mode (which the Timeline's dtape is using).
8. **Boss DM-2/Behringer Vintage Delay**: Simple, but well-voiced. I don't have much to say about these. The delay time is short unless you have a DM-2w and there's no modulation on the repeats. Despite that, these are rich sounding delays that excel at slapback and short delay for leads.
9. **Behringer Vintage Time Machine**: A DMM clone, but darker and more lofi. The preamp get create loud and crunchy overdrive and it oscillates wildly low on the feedback knob. The modulation, while fun, does not compare to the real deal.",2018-06-26 13:25:06

3576,"1. Look up ""flutter"" and ""VMO"" for aircraft, it would take immense skill to control a plane above the VMO and overcome the flutter. The plane would have likely broken apart regardless. The air gets denser and thicker the lower you are when you're flying, and if a plane doesn't reduce speed the lower it gets it will be in trouble. To say they could crash into the tower at full speed is a major stretch. Probably impossible, especially with amateur pilots in control.

2. And for the maneuvers, United 175 executed an incredible climb likely thought to be impossible before a ridiculous dive before striking the tower. As stated above you simply can't fly passenger planes so fast and aggressive, and besides the speed it dove practically straight towards the ground before leveling out and crashing.

And even more so, before American 77 hit the pentagon it executed an incredible 270 degree turn spiraling out of the air to end up perfectly parallel with the pentagon. Oh, and this was at speeds far exceeding the VMO for that altitude. Oh, and this wasn't some expert pilot in control, it was a terrorist who took a few lessons in a small engine plane.

It's like saying you could take a few driving lessons in a small sedan, then jump into an F1 car and win a race against the pros. All while driving that car faster than it can even possibly go, and making driving maneuvers not even possible. ",2018-06-26 18:01:46

3578,"I saw some of my friends getting similar problems, usually related to the old hardware (still powerful but just older than 3 years, let's say), conflicts between Android SDK installed in more than one place, or artifacts of Windows 7 to 10 migration. The most annoying was the problem with new Hyper-V emulator promising better performance but due to hardware incompatibilities resulting in completely unusable environments.

I switched this year to MacOS due to similar problems and headaches related to emulator performance and build times on Windows. I sometimes use Visual Studio 2017 Preview on Windows 10 just to get better IDE experience, because Visual Studio for Mac is still inferior even to Visual Studio Code, not mentioning Rider or the original Visual Studio.

Unfortunately, even though Xamarin experience on Mac is relatively good, it's far inferior to the experience of Flutter development (hot reload, Visual Studio Code extension etc.). There are some solutions like Mfractor, Gorilla Player or Xamarin Live Player that try to make it easier and more pleasant but usually are limited to vanilla XF.

I can confirm that most of the time removing `/bin` and `/obj` folders followed by `/packages` deletion solves the problem. There is a [dedicated extension for this](https://github.com/yuv4ik/vsmacdeepclean), which says a lot about how common it is. Sometimes it's necessary to check build options (e.g. some architectures might be not supported), so I recommend using ready-made templates like Prism or [MvxScaffolding](https://github.com/Plac3hold3r/MvxScaffolding).

I used to have evenings when I was spending hours on solving stupid problems with incompatible nuget packages and XAML compilation errors. Fortunately, now if something like this occurs, there's a clear information in build log stating what package depends on what other package that causes conflict. When it comes to XAML errors the simplest solution is just to comment out some of the  XAML code to check whether it causes problem. Usually it's my fault that something crashes.",2018-06-26 18:17:18

In the darkened reflection of a window right before her destination she fixed up her appearance. Looking at her reflection she spoke. \*\*Remember, Shale... not even the slightest attempts at using your magic.\*\*  She took in a deep breath and sighed. This was going to be her fourth encounter with the man of her affections, Vanon of Banner Uhl. A hobgoblin wizard who specialized in combat tactics. She genuinely loved this man, however...

Another deep breath in and out as she was now in front of the squalid inn that they resided in to not attract any attention, good or otherwise. The genasi only knew of this through her mild attempts of stalking the group that Vanon led, The Unfavored, and tracking them back to this area. She slowly stepped through the door, and looked around.

In the usual booth, the members of The Unfavored, sat. Vanon, who Shale's eyes immediately landed on, was deep in a book. \*Always studying, he's so disciplined.\* Shale thought to herself. Marvek, a goliath who was largely built and muscular, sat next to him drinking his weight in ale. Across from Marvek sat a man named Inaros, more of mystery, but a man who supported the rest of the group in morale. Lastly, although the back of the booth paled her small form, Shale knew sat Whisp, a gnome who wore an owl mask. However, Shale's entrance wasn't exactly unnoticed as multiple other patrons of the pub approached her immediately. Her only reaction was that of disgust, and while she may have taken advantage of these poor saps in the past, now that her heart was shockingly grasped by this hobgoblin she showed no interest in others. Yet along with the scrounging pigs that noticed her, Marvek also took note and he nudged Vanon slightly. The hobgoblin's lips moved and they seemed to have spoken to one another quickly, but Shale couldn't hear any of it. All she could do was sit on the other side. Eventually, Vanon's eyes brought themselves up from the attention to his book and scanned the room. As soon as they landed upon Shale, a very reluctant sigh was seen. However, to the genasi, as soon as the eyes landed on her, she had a massive grin on her face, happy that he even noticed her. 

A small back and forth between the hobgoblin and the goliath, and the larger among them stood up from the booth. Allowing his wizard ally out from the inner seat. As Marvek sat back down, Vanon walked towards Shale. Not afraid to confront issues. He sat down across Shale, and looked at her with narrowed eyes that harbored annoyance. \*\*This is the fourth time this week, Shale.\*\* The hobgoblin spoke up in a serious tone. \*\*You can't keep coming here in order to win our favor.\*\* Vanon sneered, this Shale had been, ever since she found out about their place of safety which was about six days ago. \*\*What must we do to rid ourselves of your presence?\*\*

The genasi shook her head fiercely at his second statement. \*\*Not the favor of The Unfavored, just your favor, Mr. Vanon, sir.\*\* Her heart fluttered, trying to get out her statement. Her eyes were averted downward towards her hands which sat in her lap.  \*\*I only wish to gain your favor...\*\* Her voice, which was stern and confident when confronted with the commoners that aimed to woo her, was now timid and coy. Her cheeks flushed with a dark cyan.  \*\*I have not brought my spellbook, nor do I have any components or an arcane focus. I can put my hands on the table if you fear for somatic motions for casting spells.\*\* As she spoke, again Vanon's eyes narrowed on her.  \*\*I don't know what else to do in order to win even a semblance of trust.\*\* The hobgoblin took a swig of his flagon that he brought over from his table as she spoke, but never broke his gaze. Despite not having eye contact, Shale could feel his eyes boring into her, and it made her all the more nervous. 

A voice spoke from The Unfavored's table. \*\*C'mon Vanon, at least smile at 'er.\*\* A now rowdy goliath  was looking onward towards the event. To him, Vanon never seemed to harbor much affection for anyone. The only way he knew how to bring affection was to keep them alive in combat. Outside of that, he was rather cold and calculated in all of his dealings, either that or he was studying in some form. \*\*If he doesn't like you, Miss, then we don't mind keeping you company!\*\* He then spoke up after another quick swig from a large mug suitable for his size. This comment sparked a harsh reaction from Shale as she barked back.

\*\*There is no chance that I'll keep anyone other than Mr. Vanon company. Either I am with him, or I am leaving for my home!\*\* Her eyes were fierce and unyielding in her comment. She then composed herself once again, after losing her composure. She went to fix her hair, and her eyes went back to her infatuated state. However, Marvek was more than a little unnerved by the sudden outburst and sat down only to be laughed at by Inaros and Whisp. \*Oh, god... I shouted his companions down in front of him. Please don't let him hate me.\* The thought to herself. However, she looked up to see him smirking at what just transpired. 

\*\*Shale, I am skeptical about all things. If you are trying to gain favor to join The Unfavored, then all you need to do is apply to be a member at our base of operations in Phandalin.\*\* Once again, Shale shook her head. \*\*If it's not to be a member of our organization, then what exactly do you wish of us that requires you to consistently disrupt our downtime?\*\*

The genasi's cheeks flushed once again. \*Such a direct question... Granted, I shouldn't have expected no less from Mr. Vanon\* She looked up and for the first time Shale's eyes met Vanon's clearly. \*\*I don't seek anything from The Unfavored.\*\* She paused, hesitantly pulling together her next sentence. \*\*To be clear, I have fallen in love with you. I know, that you don't like that I'm also a user of the arcane, but I hope you'll look past that.\*\* The genasi started fidgeting within her seat. \*\*I've heard of your exploits through heralds, and from the people you've encountered. The way they sow your personality, which is true to form, and how you handle yourself is the reason why you're the object of my desire, Mr. Vanon. I need that sort of direction from someone such as yourself...\*\* She sighs and her head droops down in regret. \*\*I've taken advantage of many using my appearance and my magic. Yet, never have I thought that I would be on the giving end of that kind of affection.\*\*

There was a slight pause. \*\*Very well, we'll settle this now.\*\* The hobgoblin reached in his cloak and pulled out a decent sized tome that was holstered in leather straps near his chest. This gesture brought about a near look of panic to the genasi. The idea of a spell coming from Vanon could mean anything. After a few moments of the wizard flipping through pages within the book he spoke up a bit. \*\*Now then... Zone of Truth.\*\* With the spell now known to Shale, the panicked look was relieved and she smiled and willingly gave into the spell. \*\*If you answer the right way, perhaps you may involve yourself with me...\*\*

A bright smile lightened upon her face and she nodded. \*\*Then I have nothing to worry about, Mr. Vanon!\*\*",2018-06-26 19:04:19
3582,"Yeah, that's a pretty similar effect but on a smaller magnitude. In the case of the A380 wake, the magnitude of the wake would be so large than something like a Cessena flying through it directly after would tossed around wildly like a child throwing their toy. In the case of helicopter blades, the effect is a bit more subtle.

Helicopter blades are generally operating within their own wake during hover. This will cause the local angle-of-attack (and lift) of the helicopter blades to decrease due to effects known as [downwash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downwash). To compensate from this decrease in angle-of-attack, the helicopter blades will move the trim angle of the blades to be higher. However, the blades can only move to a certain maximum angle, so if for example the helicopter was producing a lot of lift at one time, then the blades suddenly slowed down suddenly, the strength of the wake may be high enough to induce a downwash strong enough to stall the blades. I'm not expert in helicopter and I can't tell you how much of a concern this really is, but its certainly possible.

I think the primary problem in helicopter wakes are generally more dynamic effects such as [flutter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeroelasticity#Flutter). Essentially when you have cyclical aerodynamic loading, you can hit a certain resonant frequency that causes unstable growth in the forces on the structure. Again, I'm not an expert in helicopters but I do know that flutter is something they always need to consider when designing copters.


Another thing helicopters are susceptible to is [retreating blade stall](http://www.copters.com/aero/retreating.html). Since the blades are rotating 360 degrees, there's always a blade moving in the direction opposite to travel. At a blade section, the velocity of air it will see is the velocity of the blade relative to the helicopter CG minus the velocity of the helicopter CG relative to the atmosphere. So as the speed of the helicopter increases, the flow over the retreating blade actually decreases. This is what governs the maximum speed of a helicopter, since at a certain forward speed (with max blade rotation speed) you'll reach a point where the retreating blade can't generate enough lift because the local airflow is too slow, and thus it will stall.

3583,"I'll investigate it as a possibility.  For a relatively simple UI it strikes me as the ideal opportunity for a cross platform approach.  I haven't built anything substantial with Flutter yet, and I've been meaning to give it a thorough test.  A Nano wallet sounds like a neat project to try it out on. ",2018-06-26 19:14:36
3584,"Re-entry may happen due to bypass tracts (WPW for example), dilated and distorted anatomy (ex.: Atrial Flutter) or Scars due to previous myocardial infarction, myocarditis, previous surgeries or other diseases. Exercise, stress, drugs and other conditions may trigger the beginning of arrhythmias, which depend on these re-entry circuits to be sustained for longer periods of time.

Automatic arrhythmias, however, may happen without re-entry circuits. Inappropriate sinus tachycardia or Ventricular Ectopic beats in a patient with Thyreotoxicosis or a Pheochromocytoma for example are purely due to an increased sympathetic tone (or increased automaticity)",2018-06-26 19:33:08
