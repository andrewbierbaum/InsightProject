2,"One way data binding is supported by WPF also, I mean, two-way data binding is the unusual odd man out. And of course, the one way data flow functions have to be immutable and you have to take a dependency whenever when you read a property imperatively.<p>What they&#x27;ve done with react native sounds a lot like how WPF works anyways (scene graph updated in UI thread, rendering thread then renders scene graph). Now, there is nothing wrong with that, I think its all good. But I don&#x27;t think there is a good reason to use React in Windows project since most of the problems it solves have already been solved.",2015-01-29 06:36:34,8964682
3,"If you look at the demo you&#x27;ll see that while it&#x27;s likely close to the best you can do with web tech, the physics don&#x27;t feel correct because we can&#x27;t reuse the native constants.

The biggest conceptual difference from what I can see is that Nativescript allows you to make calls to any native API method.  With Titanium you can only call those native APIs that have been wrapped.<p>With Titanium, I suppose you could say that the cross-platform wrapper API and the product are one in the same.  Nativescript promotes their abstracted cross-platform API as a kinda optional add-on to the platform.<p>That&#x27;s just my thoughts after looking at it for 5 minutes.",2015-03-05 18:18:08,9152683

Tons of editors do JS well. As soon as you start mixing technologies, the IDEs quickly degrade in overall usefulness and you basically have an IDE for one tech and a dumb text editor for the other. Nuclide is opinionated and provides a nice integrated end-to-end experience if you buy into the tech it supports. If you don&#x27;t use any of that tech (Hack, react, buck, react native, flow, phabricator, mercurial, etc) or only use 1 language&#x2F;platform at a time (like a pure objective-c iOS app) then Nuclide basically is Atom.<p>Nuclide&#x27;s value is super apparent with React Native. You need to be able to edit JS and Objective-C and eventually Java, and it would be nice to have all the autocomplete&#x2F;click-to-symbol&#x2F;code search goodies for all three. Let alone debugging all of them and jumping between the stacks. No IDE provides all the features you need for a project like React Native out of the box. So we built one (leveraging Atom of course). It is magic working on a React Native app and using the same debugging UI to step through the JS, and then the Objective-C, and then using the SAME interface to debug your Hack code on the server.<p>Finally, over time you&#x27;ll start to see a bunch of really, really smart integration with tools and libraries like Relay and GraphQL. We already have some internally--I can &quot;click to definition&quot; in a GraphQL query and see where it is defined in JS, and then click through and see where it is implemented in Hack on the server. Simple symbol search can&#x27;t do that and spanning multiple languages and stacks is unsupported by most IDEs. Nuclide is opinionated so we can do deep integration like that...we leave the general editor-stuff to Atom proper.<p>Re: clumsy demo.

No. It just made it easier for JS devs to not learn Swift or Objective C. But it hasn&#x27;t innovated much in terms of the user. Most of what they&#x27;ve done has been in Javascript frameworks; how innovative is that really? I actually like React, but it isn&#x27;t like they&#x27;ve invented HTTP.

60,"The cross platform experience will never match the native experience. Think about on the desktop. The only cross platform apps that behave natively on Mac, Windows, GNOME (and derivatives) and KDE are apps tha have completely separate front-ends for every platform. Firefox is an ok example of this, although it in a way forms its own platform rather than integrating with its host, still it pulls it off better than other cross-platform apps. The Transmission bittorrent client is perhaps a better example, it has at least 4 mature front ends: gtk, qt, cli and os x. This is only feasible for a little free software project like Transmission because its UI is fairly simple, it has a list of torrents, a settings dialog and a properties panel.<p>Most apps that try to be cross platform just use a UI toolkit that acts as a cross platform compatability layer. Qt, GTK, Swing, WxWidgets and Tk all fit the bill. The result is that the app doesn&#x27;t look good or integrate especially deeply into any platform, except sometimes with the platform the the developers personally use.<p>There are few exceptions to this rule. One is Sublime Text 2+ which is built on Qt. Without any customization, its theme looks OK, but doesn&#x27;t match the design language of any platform, and its integration with its host platform is non-existant, everything happens within the sublime text window (no notifications or system tray&#x2F;menubar widgets, no quick-view previews in Finder or Nautilus, etc). It&#x27;s possible to improve integration by intstalling a custom theme which lets the user override a lot of the UI design, including the margins and padding, and plugins are written in python and can access a lot of host platform features.<p>If you want a native experience, you have to write a native app. You can share your business logic by linking to the same C++ code or in the future maybe by using react native and sharing the same non-view code.

I&#x27;m using Genymotion and the live reload seems to work about half the time (as in I usually have to save the file twice to see my changes). It also sometimes can&#x27;t connect to Chrome devtools. At some point I&#x27;ll dive into webpack, genymotion, watchman, and devtools to see if I can fix these things but it&#x27;d be nice to have everything work smoothly out of the box.<p>2. Speaking of devtools, devtools! I could imagine some really nice UI that wraps devtools directly into Deco but I didn&#x27;t see that in the video (admittedly I skipped around a little).<p>3. I love the built in styling bar. Right now styling for me involves having a color palette tab, a CSS reference, and an HTML&#x2F;React native UI components reference tab open.<p>4. I have one more problem that could probably be solved with a 10 minute investment on my part: react with electron and react native require different nodejs versions. React native needs at least v4.0 and I believe electron only works with 0.12.9 and below. Currently I switch between them using &quot;n&quot;. I suppose this problem is unique to my situation but this is also the kind of thing an IDE could handle with project settings.<p>Well this kind of devolved into me listing my pain points with React but I&#x27;m excited to try this editor and I just signed up for the waitlist!<p>EDIT: clarification on point #4",2016-02-10 20:24:25,11075693

I don&#x27;t want a separate extension for OSX, Windows, and Linux. I want all the code about, say, filesystem handling to be in a single place (in neatly separated platform specific files). This applies to networking code, rendering, input, etc. I know at the bottom of the article there is hope of integrating it with the original project, but given that we are starting literally on the opposite end of the spectrum, I&#x27;m worried we will never reach this hypothetical nirvana.

Both are application delivery platforms.<p>My problems with React:<p>- They try to push a programming paradigm, without considering that other programmers may have different or even better paradigms.<p>- They put too much functionality into a single framework.<p>- Frameworks are a bad idea anyway. It is much better to divide functionality into self-contained libraries.<p>- They try to redo what the web, a huge standardization effort, is doing.<p>- React does not fully support all HTML&#x2F;CSS constructs.<p>Now all of this isn&#x27;t really a problem right now. But if React grows and gains more traction, then it could become a problem (just like Internet Explorer became a problem after a while).",2016-08-03 11:54:29,12217275

And lately I have played around with react native, but I felt uneasy jumping ship to use solely react native for the very same reason.<p>I instead decided to learn Android programming. There&#x27;s really nothing to lose going that route (after all, you&#x27;re learning Java, which is arguably the #1 popular language in the world, so even if you end up giving up on Android, you still know Java), compared to spending the same time learning React Native which has very uncertain future (I would trust it much more if it was not from a corporate entity like Facebook)",2016-09-27 21:51:59,12593548

When someone open sources their technology and adds a set of detailed clauses that adds some restriction (doesn&#x27;t matter if it&#x27;s a &quot;real&quot; restriction or not), it means they couldn&#x27;t go all out. It also means as a user, you do have reasons to be cautious about it, not because of what the license says in detail, but because of the reason behind the behavior.<p>But anyway, this patent issue is just one part of the larger issue, which is uncertainty. When Apple or Android changes the API policy in the future, you&#x27;ll be struggling to adapt to the new reality with what you have. Sometimes it works, but sometimes it doesn&#x27;t. Currently it does make sense for some people to build using react native, but if I were you, I would rather learn Android. Really, if you already have iOS experience, a lot of the paradigm is pretty similar and it won&#x27;t be super difficult to learn.<p>This &quot;cross platform&quot; concept used to be valuable maybe in 2010 when it wasn&#x27;t clear what mobile platforms would be dominant (with windows phones, blackberries, and even samsung launching their own developer platforms).

While many of us have seen fads come and go we have to admit the wild success and stability of many open source libraries without formal agreements to maintain them. Everything from Rails, to Django, to jQuery, and Linux distros. There is a caveat here that JS libs do seem to die out faster and have questionable quality but again plenty are also great.<p>I think the choice of React Native really boils down to understanding the platform and source.

If I want to hit all devices or most I&#x27;ll build a great responsive web app. At the end React Native is today NOT a production level solution that will cover android and iPhone devices, android is a separate toolkit.<p>My rambling is done I suppose.

240,"I know it&#x27;s not really new but I&#x27;ve been playing with Erlang (really the whole BEAM family including Elixer and LFE) a little and it seems very interesting. The idea that future performance gains will be achieved through parallelism has been around for a bit but at least from my perspective it seems like the tools to achieve those gains have become significantly more available (not just the technology itself, but the community, books&#x2F;tutorials, and the lessons learned).<p>Given the amount of logic being offloaded to the client in webapps and the increase in app stores (package manager GUIs with price tags) I&#x27;m wondering if there won&#x27;t be a return of more dedicated desktop apps. I think Spotify, Slack, and other electron&#x2F;react native style apps may be the opening salvo. They seem to be mostly geared towards allowing offline operation as opposed to enabling distributed applications, but it&#x27;d be interesting to see if&#x2F;how that arises out of people becoming used to native apps again. I could imagine Slack in particular cutting down on its requests to their servers by figuring out a way to make teams opportunistically p2p and updating the server with diffs in larger chunks.",2016-10-10 21:50:12,12680030

242,"Eh, I think it is a natural process though in one&#x27;s <i>professional</i> life. Especially with something like phones where the complexity has just exploded within each platform. The number of ways to deploy code on iOS alone (ObjC, Swift, Cordova, React native, etc.) has increased rapidly, and the size of the system apis alone has increased massively. Some form of specialization is likely inevitable. There was a time when the web only had webmasters, and they did everything from devops to backend to frontend. Gradually it became handy for a lot of people to focus their professional career on one area they were particularly good at, especially to move to the absolute peak of their potential.<p>By all means people should try out things, and keep up with things, but for a lot of professional reasons it makes sense to have a core competency. Of course it also makes sense to move that as needed.",2016-10-13 02:21:41,12697938

We are hired because something went wrong and its our job to patch it up.<p>We come in with the expectation of getting things back on track.

A script block contains a bit of local logic and event handlers.<p>Component = &lt;template&gt; + &lt;script&gt; + &lt;style&gt;. Give it a name with the .vue extension. Now you can use it like a custom HTML tag.<p>(If you really want JSX you can use it, too.

260,"Xamarin Native developer here,
I started off by trying to create a Pokemon Go Map app. Although I got off to a quick start, slowly it downed upon me that I started spending too much time finding fixes for Xamarin issues rather that programming. I used macbook as agent and visual studio as IDE. Sometimes the deployment would take 5 minutes! I then had to restart the agent to fix it. As a programmer I am rather a person who runs a code, change a little bit in code, then run it again. If I dont understand things I google it or find the documentation. Thats my way of learning things instead of reading through programming books.<p>For me Xamarin Native was slow and rigid. I highly doubt I could make &#x27;innovative&#x27; apps with Xamarin. Maybe it is okay for people who want simple things like a &quot;to-do app&quot; or somethign that fetches list of images and displays it.<p>I wanted more and found no solution for things I needed, so I gave up and started xcode (swift + some objective c).<p>And let me be clear here, if I had spent same amonut of time on xcode as xamarin I would have been iOS dev master :)<p>Things just works much better. You can do anything you imagine with Xcode and swift. With Xamarin its more like find whatever library is out there and try to create something by combining these. Too many bugs.<p>This is no sly dig on Xamarin or Microsoft as I use alot of MS products myself. I have also tried phonegap, react native etc. and Xamarin is the best when it comes to cross platform without a question, but none of these can match true native coding (xcode  swift&#x2F;objc)",2016-11-14 15:44:02,12950467

271,"Sorry, I haven&#x27;t yet tried CBL together with react, so I don&#x27;t know how mature that solution would be - CBL works with native ObjC&#x2F;Java code, so I guess some adapters would be needed for React to work with it. This at the same time is one of my problems with React Native - it&#x27;s expensive in programmer time to access resources &#x2F; native libraries that aren&#x27;t provided yet by the core. Just to compare with a very small project: python-for-android, there you can directly access any Java function available on the device runtime, it automatically binds to all of it. React native on the other hand seems very frameworky and boxed in, but has a great portable UI definitions and build&#x2F;prototyping workflow.<p>I hope one day soon, after already 10 years of iPhone, we finally get a sane development environment again - with stable APIs, responsive UIs, portable code, easy networking and persistence, but at the same time fast to prototype and hook up.

274,"hmm. on my own without much money to bootstrap with I&#x27;m just focusing on getting the mvp out. if it fails, I&#x27;ll just write another app&#x2F;pivot based on both feedback and empirical testing. I think that&#x27;s the conventional wisdom for keeping a startup lean and not getting too invested in one big idea.<p>as for creating the code with less effort, I&#x27;d say either a good microframework <i>OR</i> a more monolithic one - both have advantages and disadvantages for a small project. the advantage with a node&#x2F;express backend vs meteor for example is that you can just write the API and only add the components you need googling as you go. if I only want an android app that uses VERY simple auth and a very simple db that sequelize can map, I can then have more flexibility and not have to learn as much. there is less code to maintain often, not as much autogenerated code. I can also write a native android or react native app instead of being nudged towards a cordova&#x2F;phone gap solution. the con is that if you&#x27;re new or especially if you haven&#x27;t worked a tech job before your code can get disorganized or buggy, especially if you don&#x27;t know TDD (I still want to learn). also meteor has easy deploy solutions and a lot of magic.<p>similar dynamic applies to sinatra vs rails, django vs flask, etc.<p>as for sharing ideas, this doesn&#x27;t scare me at all if it&#x27;s just a chat with friends or likeminded people - actually I don&#x27;t worry much at all. if someone else can make it &#x2F;better&#x2F; and &#x2F;faster&#x2F; than me then I just picked the wrong niche, I&#x27;ll just need to pick one where I&#x27;m the best next time.

It&#x27;s not a silver bullet for anything though. Isometric web development is great, but sometimes I think it&#x27;s more of a solution in search of a problem than an actual problem (it&#x27;s great that I can render server side, but do I need to? not usually). React native is great, too (if you&#x27;re smart enough to plan your app ahead of time the right way).

A lot of people think &quot;technical debt&quot; is just bad decisions that accrue over time, but you can also get into debt by taking out a loan -- with interest. I got into debt when I bought my house. Your city probably used debt to build new schools. Governments use debt to fund, well, the whole country. Facebook took out debt to move faster. And then they had to pay it back with interest, just like my mortgage and those municipal bonds that funded the schools and the treasury notes that trade our foreign debt. Fortunately they paid it back by further developing react native, and they&#x27;re still pushing.<p>I think the Facebook engineering team is good -- they simply wouldn&#x27;t survive if they weren&#x27;t, and they&#x27;re doing fine. I don&#x27;t think they fucked anything up. I think they were conscious of the loan they were taking out, and had a repayment plan in place. So in that sense they did the responsible thing, and took out a loan for the right reasons. It worked out well for them.<p>--<p>I&#x27;m very interested to see where react native goes. I think Microsoft will see an opportunity to push against Apple, because people are falling out of love with Macs and are starting to like the Surface. And if the Surface starts selling, the Phone would too... except that MS has an ecosystem problem. There aren&#x27;t many developers targeting Windows Mobile, and there&#x27;s not a ton of expertise there as compared to Android or iOS. By backing React Native, they can get developers onto Windows platforms faster, which means the ecosystem can keep pace with the market if they can keep showing quality hardware especially for power users and professionals.

But Here&#x27;s my 2 cent anyway:<p>I&#x27;m just a young graduate, but so far what I consider the 2 most important things in starting a business are to surround yourself with the right people, and be able to manage them.<p>About your project, you can do a market study to buy time. If it&#x27;s a service, then maybe you don&#x27;t need much more than a landing page for now. Maybe you can fake the product you&#x27;re selling if it&#x27;s a desktop app, and only show videos on your landing page (I think that&#x27;s what dropbox initially did). this allows you to study the market before&#x2F;during coding and&#x2F;or keep your job at the same time.<p>As a coder, the most useful thing I&#x27;ve had in this team is a UI&#x2F;UX designer. Because without him, I&#x27;d lose hours trying to find the right spacing&#x2F;sizing&#x2F;centring for all my divs. More over, always make sure that you understand a wireframe before coding. And most importantly, make sure you have a wireframe before coding. Because maintaining your html&#x2F;react&#x2F;sass will quickly be time consuming if you change your UI often. Especially if the app&#x27;s responsive.<p>Don&#x27;t worry about the stack, use what you know. It looks like you&#x27;re in a rush to make money since you&#x27;re quitting your job. Don&#x27;t learn the latest JS&#x2F;Python Foo if you&#x27;re already efficient in Bar. If you already know react and redux, structure your code such that you can reuse as much code as possible when porting to ios&#x2F;android using react native.<p>Funny anecdote of how we lost many days trying to figure out why our bounce rate was so huge. We realised that users thought that our buttons were textboxes and wouldn&#x27;t click on them. Once we realised that, we simplified the landing page so a user HAD to know that these textbox looking objects were buttons because the only thing to do on the page was click on them. Subconsciously, the users now knew what a button looked like on the app. So yes, sometimes you will waste days on things because you&#x27;re not looking at the right place (in our case we imaged all source of problems possible, but not that users didn&#x27;t know what a button on our website looked like). Try as much as possible to stay open minded, because things will be obvious to you but not your users. Working on projects alone can make this hard to remember.<p>I guess what i&#x27;m trying to communicate is the obvious: don&#x27;t lose any time unnecessary time. Always plan ahead. Don&#x27;t under estimate the amount of work there is to do. Be able to delegate the right task to the right people at the right time while supervising that everything goes on smoothly. Remember the product is designed for users that have never used it.",2017-01-20 12:22:45,13443270
308,"the usual approach is a google form, stating what you are going to make.<p>then you presell it. meaning you sell something that does not yet exist. if X number of people buy, you build it. if too little people want it, you return their money and say sorry.<p>then you deliver the product in as little code as possible. if its just information, write an email instead of building a fully responsive javascript react native reflux multi tenant fully distributed app.<p>yes, its not called reflux. but thats what it induces in the developer.<p>edit: thats how you presell products that are sufficiently easy to make. if you are looking at bigger projects like, say, a fusion reactor - you dont presell your customers. you presell investors. you do that by saying &quot;heres the paper weve written as postdocs in university, we think we have a decent shot at making this happen&quot;. then you take the money and build the first step of your roadmap. then you go back to raising and presell &quot;see? weve built feature X successfully. now we need more money to build the next thing&quot;. and so on, until you have a product.<p>the process doesnt really change, just who you presell.",2017-01-20 14:53:21,13444169

313,"&gt; How native is react native? Does it use the platform&#x27;s look and feel<p>No. If you want native look-and-feel, you&#x27;ll need to download and install third party libraries, e.g. for Material Design. However, those third party libraries are implemented in 100% JavaScript and do not utilise the native Android components (rather just rebasing off MDL [1]), which will just end up making your app &quot;feel like a clunky web browser&quot;, particularly when debugging or rendering lots of those components to screen.<p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;getmdl.io&#x2F;started&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;getmdl.io&#x2F;started&#x2F;</a>",2017-01-24 02:09:17,13468260

320,"Native iOS developer (worked at Facebook&#x2F;Apple) who&#x27;s currently doing a bunch of contracting at the moment. I think React Native is great.<p>I think the biggest pros of react native are:<p>1) Not having to compile to see UI&#x2F;Business logic changes (Swift compiler is slow).<p>2) The ability to push changes over the air after you switch.<p>3) Large parts of your app just work cross platform with minimal changes (I&#x27;ve shipped two iOS&#x2F;Android apps).<p>4) If you have a react web team, they can now review and help out with your mobile apps.<p>5) It&#x27;s easy to keep product in synch across multiple platforms (i.e android&#x2F;iOS release at the same time).<p>I think the big cons are:<p>1) It&#x27;s Javascript.. ES6 + babel makes this a lot less terrible than it was in the days of web apps wrapped as native apps but it&#x27;s still Javascript.<p>2) If you have to do long running background tasks (network polling, bluetooth, music, location, etc) you basically have to do it in native code. This can be a big architectural pain in the ass depending on what your app does.<p>3) Ramp up time. Learning about React and all the third party libraries (Redux, etc) you will need to be productive takes time.<p>4) Cross platform testing. I.e if you share code with your web&#x2F;android engineers, they will need to be disciplined about not breaking things (npm and versioned shared libraries helps with this).<p>5) Third party library quality in Javascript land can vary a lot. This requires you spend quite a bit of time vetting them.<p>If your based in the Bay Area I&#x27;m going to be giving a talk on on some of this in March.",2017-01-27 02:16:57,13497210

There a few reasons why I was choose react&#x2F;redux. The final product would need a solid JSON API for mobile apps and an IoT type device. A SPA for the web lets me reuse the same API for all the interfaces. This POC also requires a decent about of data visualization and there seems to be a number of good data visualization components being built for react. Finally, react native could make build mobile apps easier.<p>The problem is that my lack of web development experience is really making react development hard. I decided to actually learn the basics to get a better foundation to build on. But the number of basics I need to learn seems huge as a dive deeper. ES5, then ES6, HTML5, CSS, SCSS, React, Redux, webpack, flow, etc. Also, I dislike javascript so I am not sure if I want to do all the development in javascript.<p>Something like Elm seems complicated but if I mostly just need to learn Elm it seems more straightforward.

I recently requested Travis add Microsoft Code Push as a deployment &quot;Provider.&quot; There&#x27;s an unfulfilled opportunity here for Microsoft code Push and Sentry to become an easier deployment strategy in your CI setup. Microsoft is incorporating Code Push into their Mobile Center product, but a solution should exist outside of that as well, plus it&#x27;s surprising such a setup hasn&#x27;t been popularized more generally in any CI setup this far.<p>I know Code Push is just one deployment provider, but Sentry integration on RN hasn&#x27;t been clear and it&#x27;s best to start somewhere. Basically for the top 3-5 deployment solutions, they and their customers would benefit from having example integrations. In addition, manual upload of source maps in the panel is very important too, ie for apps that haven&#x27;t gotten their CI setup built yet.<p>Their problem has been that in terms of JS they started out for web and you can easily put the URL of your source map in the footer of builds produced my webpack. So for web they have always been easy. But RN was always a novelty for them until now. To really increase their audience I recommend they make providing source maps from RN as painless as possible.<p>And they should do all this before Microsoft eats their lunch, as Code Push integration is on the horizon for integration into mobile center. And in that product they will have stack traces for both native and JavaScript, and likely source maps perfectly handled and automatically. There are still reasons why you would want to use a more general purpose CI server instead, such as Travis.

I suppose I was reacting to the previous comments as well, asserting that anyone choosing anything other than the boring, tried-and-true mature stacks for any new project whatsoever was being &quot;seduced by technology&quot; and otherwise an irresponsible and non-pragmatic neophilic dilettante who is not a Serious Businessman Like Me.<p>For the use case you&#x27;re describing, I agree completely with your comments. Perhaps a useful razor is - if you can&#x27;t state specifically why you can&#x27;t use rails (and don&#x27;t say &quot;it doesn&#x27;t scale&quot;!) - then use rails. I concede that 90% of the time, this is probably the case.<p>And yes, harping on about its age was silly of me. Age does not inherently mean anything. I&#x27;d use postgres (1984!) over mongodb anyday. And erlang is older than ruby. Right tool for the job is far more important, thanks for pulling me up on that.<p>All that said - I still think that categorically stating &quot;use boring technology&quot; or &quot;just use rails&quot; for absolutely any new project is harmful. New technologies are not always just about the new shiny, they can provide capabilities and functionality simply unachievable with the old. Look at what you can do with concurrency with phoenix. Look at what you can do with react native. Roundly writing off the whole idea of using this new tech as &quot;magpie development&quot; is just lazy.",2017-04-20 04:51:33,14154060

473,"It is very exciting to see more people write frameworks using &quot;React&quot; ideas. This will make React and similar frameworks better!<p>It seems like one of the biggest ideas that flutter brings to the table is a different approach to component libraries. It makes sense that there is a need for this given that larger companies that invest in React tend to have their own tailored component library that people outside of those companies generally don&#x27;t get to take advantage of. The startup costs to developing your own library of React components and their CSS&#x2F;Native wrappers are high.<p>That being said, when I think of prebuilt component libraries (eg, bootstrap, swing) I generally think of components that are too familiar for users and a crutch for developers to allow them to quickly develop interface code where they may not be an expert. In a high quality app, I would expect widgets to follow the patterns that other apps on the platform follow. Won&#x27;t this be difficult for a framework like Flutter which will have to re-create each of these native widgets (as apposed to React native where they are just wrapped in a JS layer)?<p>Regardless of these qualms, I&#x27;m excited to see more well funded frameworks enter this space because I&#x27;m sure that all users of frameworks in this space will benefit.

498,"&gt; Tech is driven by fashion more than anything else<p>So I agree the field has remained disorganized, with it&#x27;s research and development severely underfunded.  There is no language implementation wiki.  The field&#x27;s research is often by years of intermittent incremental papers, and little bus-factor one projects.  We&#x27;re down to like one biggish industrial research lab.  And ARPA, sigh.  And professional progress, often seems sort of exploration by an army of wandering ants, rather than purposeful pursuit of economic development and human progress.<p>So with the poorly organized professional knowledge, and the unacceptability of high onboarding costs, yes, there&#x27;s a lot of random motion.  And the scrambling mob carves a flood plain.<p>But.<p>Cohort learning is actually a good learning strategy.  And given how big the field has gotten, and the criticality of community, it&#x27;s a plausible local heuristic to &quot;follow the mob - it&#x27;s path will likely at least be plausible, even though not optimum, and the inevitable obstacles can be collaborative tunneled through, or filled in with bodies&quot;.  And the profession is not just larger, but vastly better trained than it used to be.  There&#x27;s a massive education process in progress.<p>And the &quot;driven by fashion&quot; argument gets used a lot.  At least sometimes, it&#x27;s clearly an &quot;argument from failure of imagination&quot;.  A &quot;I can&#x27;t imagine what they&#x27;re thinking, they must all be nuts&quot;.  Sometimes your expertise in some domain corner is enough to confidently say that.  Or the nuttiness is nicely compact - &quot;Google backs it, so I&#x27;m sure it will be supported for decades&quot;.  But it seems most use of the argument is more... ambitious than that.<p>&gt; Tcl is a powerful language that you can use to create complex systems with simple code, the holy grail.<p>Tcl&#x2F;Forth&#x2F;Smalltalk&#x2F;Lisp&#x2F;Self&#x2F;APL&#x2F;Oz&#x2F;... we&#x27;ve had many many languages with glints of grail.  We&#x27;re just still really bad at combining and polishing them.<p>There&#x27;s little funding for it.  So it&#x27;s a multi-decade incremental creep.  An &quot;if you&#x27;re still alive to see it&quot; bright side might be, it looks like the transition to &quot;no longer crippling&quot;, when it finally happens, might be a &quot;boom - new world&quot; kind of thing.<p>EDIT: aside: I saw the other day that React native(?) could now be packaged up with it&#x27;s own little embedded faux file system... and thought, yay, we&#x27;re catching up with 1990&#x27;s Tcl!  (The Tcl app distribution story was excellent).  You just need to have a half century of patience, and it will all work out.  Patents only last two decades.  And we&#x27;re only failing, what, 7 billion people?  Delay a year, miss a 130 million person cohort.  No problem.",2017-08-07 03:07:45,14945024

504,"Someone above made a point about how there is a big difference between your local market value and the value you bring to the company which I agree with.  The way to close that gap is through negotiation and by getting past people&#x27;s biases.<p>Even people who are generally logical will be resistant to paying a good south american developer as much as a mediocre developer who is also remote but in Seattle.<p>Even though I&#x27;m from SF this is strangely something I&#x27;ve thought about a lot. 
 What I would do in your shoes: (1) create a nice portfolio of all your work (omit the Cisco CCNA stuff, if you are looking for work as a web developer that is actually a red flag, just put your web work and claim to have done anything you can reasonably defend in an interview), talk in aspirational language about your passion for the craft of software development and always point out every way in which you were involved in collaboration with designs are in business concerns and how that informed your more technical work because your real passion is for creating useful products that people love, not just banging out code (2) write some blog posts occasionally about functional programming and how to write better tests, (3) instead of saying you are from Central America say you are &quot;currently enjoying living in Costa Rica (a US friendly timezone)&quot; or just completely omit where you are and simply say you are in EST, who cares beyond that??(4) explain that you are an expert in &quot;remote collaboration&quot; (5) humans are experts at sniffing out non-native language speakers.  Find a US Native copywriter and have them polish all your copy and pay a designer buddy to make your site look cool and modern, (6) post your resume on Hired, etc (7) ask for $175&#x2F;hr but expect to accept $150 or so.<p>This all depends on how good you really are of course.  Another US bias (possibly valid) is that php developers are paid less.  Bone up on Elixir&#x2F;Phoenix or another hot language&#x2F;framework + react native, do a cool side project even if it is quite small.<p>IMO if you did all that you&#x27;d have plenty of work at high US rates. (just for comparison, $32K&#x2F;yr is about $16&#x2F;hr, you can definitely get up to &gt; $100 or $150&#x2F;hr)<p>All that investment and the resultant relationships have real value so step 2 of course is to hire a couple of your buddies who are also good at slightly better than local market rates...",2017-08-11 06:44:04,14987169

- How mature is the tool chain? Build time?

535," definitely think that for a cross platform app, going all out with something like Cordova or React Native isn&#x27;t particularly smart.<p>Sooner or later, you are going to reach a point where you need to use a feature of the underlying OS which your abstraction layer doesn&#x27;t support well (or at all) and will end up having to make a horrible compromise<p>I cant really speak for Cordova but one of the strengths of React Native is that you can drop to native code relatively easily. Ive done this in the past for projects and its not been a problem.<p>Can you give a specific example of such a compromise?<p>I personally like Xamarin. Xamarin.Android and Xamarin.iOS get you as close to native as you can get, while still allowing you to share a fair amount of code between the platforms<p>Id say the biggest problem with xamarin, aside from debugging, is that all your developers need to learn c# right?<p>At least with the other approaches (article, Cordova, react native) mentioned they can use languages used by the target platforms (web, mobile).",2017-09-11 12:03:14,15217831

Facebook legitimately copies a startup infringing on their patents (think about the Snapchat&#x2F;Instagram feature battle), and the startup sues Facebook.

547,"I&#x27;m a react native consultant, so I&#x27;ve seen several different projects (of all different sizes).  Overall, I&#x27;ve been super happy with React Native, and would easily recommend it to anyone looking to build an Android and iOS version of the same app.<p>There have been a lot of changes since 2015 - and the overall experience has gotten quite a bit better.   There are many more modules available for both platforms (in 2015 you probably found a lot of modules only supported iOS and not Android) - and in general the whole ecosystem is more stable.<p>That said: not everything is perfect.  React Native moves quickly, so there are sometimes frustrating bugs (especially in new releases) that can take a bit of time to resolve.  Also, it&#x27;s not a great fit for every type of app. 3D games are an obvious example of when you&#x27;d want to go native (or use unity).<p>However, after having done native iOS development and react native development, I can say that react native is still faster (development speed).  In practice I find that I can reuse 95% of the code between iOS and Android, so it&#x27;s been a great win for the teams I&#x27;ve been on.",2017-09-20 14:09:13,15293852

Gluestick also allows easy creation of native apps (native&#x2F;react native&#x2F;web views) with 90+% code sharing. We also added a bunch of features (regex based routing, etc) to help with seo.

560,"Ultimately the declarative way of writing apps is objectively better and more predictable than the old mutable way :)<p>Now that said, I agree on the performance costs, and too wonder why Walmart is hellbent on this strategy, given the endless resources they have.<p>But at the end of the day, they have a head of engineering and need to make their lives simpler just like everyone else. If you know how to squeeze the performance out of RN&#x2F;React, developing apps in the semi-FP declarative sate-driven way is a dream compared to all the old ways of client app development. People who&#x27;s views are so against React&#x2F;ReactNative usually haven&#x27;t experienced it for themselves. I suggest really giving it try before making these comments which usually serve just to validate  decisions already made. I.e. to make one&#x27;s self feel better about sticking to the old ways. However, I totally understand what it feels like for new tools to pop up that put into question old ways I&#x27;ve invested a lot into. That said, don&#x27;t you think you&#x27;d be better off fully exploring these ways before shooting them down? Don&#x27;t tell me you have--zero people that have grokked the effectiveness of declarative state-driven programming make these remarks. They usually leave some hint at their experience with React. In short, it&#x27;s only you left in the dust :)<p>Give the tools a try, which I know will likely be hard for you because you are likely coming from the Native world. I will say this: it&#x27;s a lot more than just one language to make hybrid apps (i.e. like past tools such as Titanium). And, of course perf will be a challenge. That said, the perf is amazing given what it is. But more importantly, the style of development is what it&#x27;s all about. It&#x27;s so different and so much more predictable&#x2F;debuggable than the old mutable ways. To me, it matters not that it&#x27;s in JS. What matters is the declarative state driven way of development. If you can do that in native code, you&#x27;re basically doing the most important aspect--and basically there&#x27;s no argument from me there. There are some libraries that allow for that, but it&#x27;s nowhere near the extent of what you can do in React&#x2F;JS, given its ecosystem. I lot of work is being put in here to make this the best of breed future of application development. If you can&#x27;t see it, you&#x27;re missing out. Do your homework on React once and for all. You can thank me later.<p>Last point: Walmart&#x27;s tool here is specifically meant for making apps where some of it you want in &quot;actual native&quot; and other parts in &quot;react native.&quot; Without a doubt coding the React style is the best DX for UI development. AND without a doubt, &quot;actual native&quot; performs far FAR better. So what they have here is a toolbox for those with an &quot;engineering mindset&quot; to pick the best tool for the job. Everything that&#x27;s happening is just getting better and better for all parties involved, no matter where your experience lies.",2017-10-01 09:23:45,15377022

617,"Haha, the alarm is quite annoying. I have custom alarm sounds as a todo now.<p>My reasons for using React:<p>Speed of development: I work with react nearly everyday at work, so a lot of its usage has become muscle memory. React abstracts away the need to think about the DOM, I don&#x27;t need to write any query selectors, or think about what part of the DOM should be re-rendered when. The end result is that I can code up a simple view, and focus my efforts on the complex&#x2F;fun stuff - the bit which counts the pushups. If I took the project no further, at least I invested my time on the most rewarding and fun parts of development.<p>Code reusability for Mobile apps: The alarm uses setInterval to track when to go off. This works well for me on desktop, but when minimising a browser on a mobile phone the javascript code stops executing. I need an app. With this in mind, having a React codebase means I can create a mobile app with react native and reuse code I already have. Also, going forward I&#x27;d have parity of web app and mobile features.<p>I sympathise with those who call for dynamic websites with a sprinkling of Javascript. I think most traditional websites like blogs and simple e-commerce sites are better served by that model. But, in cases where your sites core functionality needs JavaScript anyway, has a lot of state changes, and resemble what would have been a desktop app years ago, React makes sense. Saying that, even with traditional sites I&#x27;d be tempted to use react with server side rendering. Just because I love how I can reason about everything in JavaScript, compose my App from the ground up with components (divide and conquer), and group code by responsibility as opposed to arbitrary splitting between business logic and views.",2018-01-08 19:27:58,16099411

Initially I was sceptical, mainly about learning dart.

Performance, I didn&#x27;t do any benchmarks, but a simple list with thousands of items feels much smoother on flutter than react native. 
There are packages for redux as well in flutter, so state management is taken care of [2]. 
The only downside I experienced with flutter is that Json handling is clumsy, apparently because flutter doesn&#x27;t support reflection, which would be necessary to have comfortable Json-decoding like with Javas gson or go&#x27;s json package [3].<p>Another thing to consider is that react native will render on one thread, and handle the application logic on another thread, but that means the application logic is still restricted to a single javascript thread, which can lead to bottlenecks eventually. From what I understand (haven&#x27;t tested), dart can work multithreaded, having an advantages there.<p>End of the day, I would chose flutter over react native.

670,"I work for a tiny 2-man project and we need to save all the time we can, so we don&#x27;t code review. We actually have an unofficial policy: all code that is directly user-facing (web design for example) is handled by me and all backend stuff is handled by the other guy.<p>My previous company worked the same way though, and it was a real company with funding and customers. It was another tiny startup (essentially 4 person engineering team) and the work was cleanly divided: one person did the entire iphone&#x2F;android app (react native), one person did the website, one person did the backend and one person did the analytics. For an established company this would be a nightmare -- we had tons of bugs in production, usually reported by our users. However, having a really clean separation of duties made it extremely efficient in terms of management, because everyone knew that if they wanted something done on the mobile app they just asked the guy who did the whole thing, he knew the codebase thoroughly and could fix or add the change almost immediately, then would work on the next task on his trello board (which almost nobody else even looked at). We essentially had no management (CEO was constantly gone looking for more funding) so this organizational structure was a huge boon, and allowed us to push out huge features in 1-2 weeks. I think that if we had a full time QA person this really could have worked well, and by &quot;well&quot; i mean &quot;we could have done the job of a ~15 person engineering and QA team with only five people.&quot;",2018-04-15 19:43:58,16844514

672,"Hi,<p>This is part of a project where the entire app code is shared across native and web apps. The app uses React Native for iOS and android, and react-native-web for the web app. All three apps run from the same code.<p>Due to this constraint, the only way to define styles that can be reused across web and native is to use react native&#x27;s `StyleSheet` api.<p>About this:<p>&gt; a button can&#x27;t be both a Google style button and a Facebook style button - and the code doesn&#x27;t have any checks for that.<p>Button receives a single string prop that defines the button style, from there the bool values are calculated:<p>```
    const isDefault = imStyle === &#x27;default&#x27;;
    const isPrimary = imStyle === &#x27;primary&#x27;;
    const isFacebook = imStyle === &#x27;facebook&#x27;;
    const isGoogle = imStyle === &#x27;google&#x27;;

687,"You should consider your target audience and your own resources. For consumer facing apps, I&#x27;m not sure an hybrid (cordova &#x2F; ionic &#x2F; webview shell) approach is really up to par, as the UX is really challenging to make right and performance will be lacking. That said, a native approach requires twice the codebase and twice the resources (man hours) roughly, so the challenge becomes maintaining feature parity and team expenses.<p>Apps targeted for B2B users are considerably more flexible in terms of UX, the goal is mainly to help users get stuff done, so hybrid is more viable here. Which is what we usually do with cordova. Some considerations to bear: using cordova, the team doesn&#x27;t really get much expertise with the proper platform, so problems are sometimes harder to debug because of lack of developer maturity in the platform. You need to design with an eye to light performance requirements, which usually means facilitating inputs and maybe have a separate web interface for complex UI like dashboard and management.<p>If you absolutely have to share code between apps, your options are:<p>- hybrid approaches like cordova, or build your own native web view shell and load your web code manually<p>- react native, which is not v1 yet, and looking at it recently I&#x27;m personally not sold on it yet, many unkown unknowns to actually double down and build on it. But that&#x27;s just my opinion.<p>- Black box compatibility frameworks like Xamarim, Nativescript and the like. They work by giving a common platform middleware that builds to multiple target platforms. There are a lot of trade offs here, specially the lack of control. If a feature is buggy or not supported there is little recourse.<p>- I have read some big companies share code via C++ bindings used natively on each platform (loaded in Java and Objective C).

711,"I&#x27;ll try and boil it down to some points that hopefully build on each other:<p>- In the mobile development there are a few approaches, including but not limited to: full-native, near-native, and webview (these aren&#x27;t official terms, I just made them up)<p>- &quot;full-native&quot; is using Java on Android, Swift&#x2F;ObjC on iOS, generally implying using all the tooling&#x2F;patterns&#x2F;etc that come. This is the hardest in terms of learning curve, Swift concepts often do not translate to android, so it&#x27;s like two steep climbs.<p>- &quot;near-native&quot; is using some library&#x2F;tool that compiles down to JVM bytecode&#x2F;native code but usually implies bringing in new&#x2F;alternative tooling (integration levels vary) that holds the promise of having less warts. This is where tools like React Native[0], Vue Native[1], NativeScript[2] fit in (I&#x27;ll explain how later).<p>- &quot;webview&quot; is when you just make a mobile-friendly webpage and embed it inside an app by simply displaying it fullscreen. Android&#x2F;iOS also has features these days where you can pin webpages that act like mobile apps to screens, and IIRC android &quot;instant&quot; apps are the same concept. These have been criticized heavily for performance&#x2F;platform integration issues. This is where tools like Cordova[3] and Ionic[4] fit in.<p>SIDENOTE: FirefoxOS (RIP) was a mobile OS that took this to the extreme, having everything just be a webview and investing in the browser ecosystem heavily.<p>- In terms of difficulty&#x2F;ramp-up-time&#x2F;vendor-lockin, webview &lt; near-native &lt; native -- assuming that you know web tech already, and that the near-native toolchain is indeed easier.<p>- While React[7] started by targeting the web exclusively (though I think it might have always been a goal to branch out), they built in enough generalization to support react-native, whose feature is that it moved the boundaries a bit -- it works using native platform code to run a JS processing thread, and offers interop to native features directly. So it&#x27;s not a webview, and not completely native, it belongs in the near-native camp but it uses concepts that allows you to treat it almost like a webview app.<p>- The existence of React Native is a huge difference-maker for react. If you want to sell your team on react, the ability for a frontend developer to easily handle mobile application development is a strong selling point.<p>- Since react native&#x27;s near-native mechanism is well known, other projects have started to incorporate it -- Angular[5] proponents (and actually any js app in general) can use NativeScript[2] and Vue[6] proponents has been working on Vue Native[1] for a while.<p>- React Native, Vue Native, NativeScript are all attempts to bring the render-in-a-thread, shim-to-native-code-where-possible paradigm to different frontend frameworks that have existed.<p>- There are differences between Angular, React, and Vue that make it difficult for one project to interface with all of them (theoretically NativeScript could do it, as it supports any old JS app), and those differences are often opportunities for tight integration and developer ergonomics&#x2F;features.<p>- In the end, all this is meant to enable native-feeling application development with minimal vendor&#x2F;SDK lock-in and difficulty.<p>- There are other interesting approaches in the near-native space like <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;flutter.io&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;flutter.io&#x2F;</a> (almost like web view except natively by drawing every pixel on the screen) and <a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lambdanative.org&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lambdanative.org&#x2F;</a> (take a small lisp runtime with you)<p>[EDIT] - As pointed out in the subcomments on this post, React Native does not &#x27;compile down&#x27; to native code -- that is true.

That is, my app starts out as Native, and then, for some &#x27;activities&#x27; (in Android-speak) -- I use react-native.<p>I have implemented native modules to get access to platform specific elements from React native code (eg networking apis, security, hardware device access, device-preference&#x2F;database stores) -- while  basic forms&#x2F;widgets and navigation logic for some pieces are in React, leveraging React-native and react-native-web underneath.<p>I think the UI paradigm introduced by React is a sweet spot for UI development (concentrating on state as first-class-citizen).<p>I am hoping same paradigm (and similar abstractions) are adapted by MS toolchain for desktop and console UI in .NET-based solutions.<p>Another side note (not RN specific) :
C# is really a much better language than JavaScript, but until browsers can supports C#-subset, JavaScript is the only game in town for the &#x27;modern&#x27; cross-platform dev efforts (eg. cross mobile, desktop and web-browsers) ).<p>In terms of some challenges I have experienced with RN:<p>a) build system. Creating a release build is a major undertaking.  As the solution has to merge the 2 worlds: native and JavaScript-specific asset management pipelines.<p>Error messages are obscure (eg I ran into issues, for example, where a path for an Icon file was too deep, moving it to shorter path, solved that one).<p>Guides are for primitive (and non-hybrid) approaches.<p>b) Lack of standard (RN and RNWeb ) support navigation component.<p>c) Small things like:  no Checkbox component for IoS..<p>d) Cross-platform app-store compatible icon management is not built in.  I use react-native-vector-icons -- so that solves that problem for me. But app-store compliancy like this should, ideally be part of such platform.<p>e) As the article points out, the integration bridge between RN and native is not efficient for &#x27;constant interaction&#x27;. Because it requires you to serialize data structures back and forth.   
So impossible to write &#x27;hybrid&#x27; apps where small parts are in RN -- instead it has to be &#x27;bigger things&#x27; that would not require too much back-and-forth.<p>f) the Debugging with Chrome over TCP bridge -- is basically a horrible&#x2F;slow&#x2F;barely working. Navigations from one screen to another take like 2 seconds, while the debug mode.  
Because my components work on web browsers, thanks to React-native-web - I end up, most of the time, debugging my RN logic using React-native-web within browser debugging tools (rather than starting up the native app and then spawning the debugger with Chrome bridge).",2018-06-15 14:15:23,17319909
726,"@hiram112.  React native works in a &#x27;conceptually&#x27; similar way as wxWidgets (if you are familiar with with that).  It uses platform&#x27;s native APIs.

The integration is also not just for widgets, but underneath it abstracts out Image, network api, basic storage&#x2F;preference primitives, screen rotation, etc.<p>For the things that it does not abstract, it let&#x27;s you write a native module, that you register with RN runtime, and then the APIs for your native module will be avialable to your RN java script code.<p>There is an active opensource ecosystem of RN-modules that you can leverage, that will work on Android and IoS , abstracting the platform specific things that RN does not do yet themselves.

- Dont be fooled by its simplicity. You can make an app in hours, but if its non trivial you will require more time to really polish it
- React code can get messy fast, its easy to lose track of where state changes happen. Choosing a well known architecture and sticking with it (ex: redux) is super helpful as complexity grows
- to get to 60fps, you need to be very precise on how and when to make state&#x2F;U.I updates, so the optimization phase can take a while. I often end up going through all components in a tree to manually disable un-necessary re-renders, or delay re-rendering after some animation has completed.
- dont use react-router, its not suited for native needs (it keeps all previous views from the stack active which creates all sorts of problems)<p>Compared to learning two languages for making an iOS and Android app, react native is incredibly fast and efficient, especially when you come from the web.

783,"This project is using React Native which is slightly different from ReactDOM (commonly referred to as just React&#x2F;ReactJS).<p>In the past, ReactJS and ReactDOM were completely interchangeable. However, some time ago now React split the DOM specific parts of the library into ReactDOM which allowed the non-DOM specific parts of the library to be shared more easily across different rendering targets. Some examples:<p><pre><code>  * android (via react-native)
  * ios (via react-native)
  * canvas https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Flipboard&#x2F;react-canvas
</code></pre>
Since the release of React Native there have been a couple of interesting projects that allow developers to use the same APIs as React Native, but rendering to the DOM instead of android&#x2F;ios native views.<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;necolas&#x2F;react-native-web"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;necolas&#x2F;react-native-web</a> is a great production ready lib but requires a bit of setup to get it working with a react-native project.<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;vincentriemer&#x2F;react-native-dom"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;vincentriemer&#x2F;react-native-dom</a> is an extremely cool experimental idea to bring react native projects more seamlessly onto the web. It&#x27;s still in early stages and has some significant tradeoffs compared to react-native-web. For one, it includes a webassembly implementation of Yoga (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;yogalayout.com&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;yogalayout.com&#x2F;</a>) which makes layout much more consistent among ios&#x2F;android&#x2F;web but at the cost of delivering more JS upfront to the browser.",2018-07-09 12:12:48,17489631

For me it&#x27;s best of breed vs simplicity. OpenID Connect is the most mature auth, rabbitmq very good messaging, elixir a lovely language, graphql the most programmer-friendly connection between frontend and backend, and react native allows 90% code sharing between web SPA and mobile apps.<p>And if you combine all of these (I mean if you finally set it all up), it&#x27;s a low number of lines of code environment.",2018-07-21 09:17:13,17581366

790,"Op here<p>What you are looking at is a Hacker News client inspired by the Apollo client for Reddit. It&#x27;s built with React Native for iOS and Android.<p>There have been recent statements from big companies, like Airbnb, about phasing out react native because it doesn&#x27;t play nicely with their native codebase. The feedback I&#x27;ve seen is all based on the misunderstanding that React Native and native isn&#x27;t a good fit. I wanted to demonstrate that this not the case, and that, if an app is built from a react native first approach, it will not just work, but work very well.<p>The codebase is in TypeScript, Native Navigation, Firebase for API, mobx-state-tree for app state, Code Push for OTA updates, Sentry for error tracking and CSS Modules with Stylus for styling.<p>I&#x27;d love to get some feedback, I&#x27;ve been building this on weekends for the last month or so.

So we have tons of miss-communication for stuff like &quot;yo I am drinking near your house meet-up&quot;. Discord just sits running all the time on your PC, which for most is running all the time.

They try and create a code symmetry and that&#x27;s not unreasonable, but then they go too far and create behavioral symmetry and that&#x27;s pretty much unacceptable for as wide a gulf as browser apps and mobile apps.

814,"The thing that I still don&#x27;t know about are how would things like data persistence be handled in a cross platform manner?<p>I recently built a kotlin Android app for work, and our architecture is tightly coupled to Android&#x27;s Room database and LiveData objects. Obviously if we build it to be cross platform we wouldn&#x27;t be able to use a Room database or LiveData objects on an iOS device. Would we have to roll our own persistence layer in a cross platform application? Or would we share business logic but still write a persistence layer using platform specific code?<p>It&#x27;s not just persistence too. Any lower level API provided by the platform would still need to be written twice, right? Accessing the camera, the devices GPS location, or anything hardware related still needs an implementation for both platforms. Or would we eventually see libraries that would abstract this layer out, similar to react native?<p>Edit: Another thought...I haven&#x27;t done much iOS development but the whole async nature of Android apps with the UI thread and background threads also seems like it would be a nightmare to deal with in a cross platform way. Does iOS involve a lot of async threads?",2018-09-14 17:30:26,17989130

<p>It really depends. 95% of the people using React Native are web engineers and React Native is their first experience doing mobile.

I have also done brownfield React Native and I can understand why they would have this perspective.<p>- What was the decision to go React Native<p>Productivity and cost. It takes a lot less time to ship a cross platform React Native app than to build it twice in kotlin&#x2F;swift. If you do consulting&#x2F;contracting work or you are an early stage startup on a budget React Native is a no brainer for most projects. Multimedia projects or games being notable exceptions.<p>My initial reaction for React Native is, it is great in the beginning but can cost companies a lot of money and time in the long run (as seen by Airbnb, Udacity, and NextDoor.) Though some big orgs do use it successfully here and there (Pinterest, Facebook, Instagram) throughout their apps.<p>All of those organizations have large engineering teams and are doing brownfield (integrating React Native into an existing project) apps. That is most likely not what you are doing.<p>Brownfield React Native is about 2-3x as hard as building a new app from scratch.

851,"BTW, for those looking for another option other than Flutter and React Native, check out NativeScript[0], or Nativescript-Vue[1].<p>Nativescript is different from react native because it includes a native call translation layer -- you can write JS that actually uses native runtime objects. It&#x27;s also got excellent support for cross platform applications that reach down to native on both platforms, and can meld right in with a fully native app as well, and is thoroughly F&#x2F;OSS (they take the marketplace approach to monetization).<p>Nativescript different from Flutter in that it has nothing to do with the tirefire that is Dart. Nativescript is OSS and is taking the marketplace approach to capitalizing and recently they got Hot Module Reloading as a result of integrating more closely with webpack&#x2F;other capable bundlers.<p>I&#x27;ve recently done projects (one larger client app, another a small personal project) in both and kept some notes on what I liked about Nativescript vs Flutter (I&#x27;m pretty biased for Nativescript now), not sure if I&#x27;ll make a blog post about it but here are some hopefully interesting points:<p>- Performance tradeoffs are roughly the same for dart vs nativescript, do hard work in an isolate (dart) or webworker(nativescript)<p>- Flutter&#x27;s reactivity is 10x more tedious than Nativescript-Vue. Making an entire other class and doing all these overrides for what should be a basic feature is pretty ridiculous, though everyone&#x27;s fine with it because they just right click in their $IDE.<p>- Flutter&#x27;s data management is not great -- everything they&#x27;ve made so far seems like a hack. I&#x27;m uncomfortable with the build function being on the state object conceptually, InheritedWidgets are just using context as a grab-bag, the BLoC pattern is so complicated.<p>- State&lt;MyPage&gt; &amp; StatefulWidget being separate classes and the State&lt;MyPage&gt; having the build function unsettles me. I don&#x27;t know if it had to be this way because of dart 2&#x27;s type system (which is subpar in my experience, Typescript is better because it at least offers duck-typed interfaces)<p>- Dart is terrible. It is a modern language yet it lacks almost none of the advances of modern languages, Dart 2 was a near rewrite and it it still manages to be less compelling than Typescript, and nowhere near languages like Go, Rust, Crystal, etc. I am kind of suspicious google is pushing this language just because they invented it and can control it -- I don&#x27;t know a single redeeming quality of dart, especially if you consider dart 1 before you consider dart 2.<p>- Flutter subtly forces you into either Material Design or Cupertino -- this surprised me. Flutter subtly pushes you towards material design, which I have no interest in, and I think most people actually trying to create unique app experiences wouldn&#x27;t either. This is a double edged sword, in Nativescript you have to seek out native-looking components, but in Flutter they&#x27;re forced upon you especially at the beginning, and I prefer the former.<p>- Automatic sending of crash logs to Google -- who thought this was a good idea? And to make it opt-out instead of opt-in?<p>- Flutter probably has the better longer term viability because it&#x27;s being embedded into Fuschia and other things google is doing.<p>- I expect Nativescript to eventually take on WASM and <i>really</i> open up the choices for languages to use with it.<p>[0]: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.nativescript.org"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.nativescript.org</a><p>[1]: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nativescript-vue.org&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nativescript-vue.org&#x2F;</a>",2018-11-24 01:23:40,18519890

Teams and individuals make mistakes and misjudgments. That is part of life. If you read my comments I said that removing RN was probably the right thing to do by the time it happened.  This is often the case with bad technological decisions in startups and is rational because of sunk cost.<p>&gt;  many_ cases and orgs where it is not a good fit<p>This is why I cite architecture. With react or react-native you really need to know where the data is coming from and how the data will flow through the application. I&#x27;m arguing that the architect should have had a plan for how this would work before introducing react native into the app.<p>Airbnb has done a lot of great react-native work, so I know the issue isn&#x27;t technical competency, but the linting rules Airbnb popularized suggest a very trees-oriented (not forest oriented) perspective on tech, which is the kind of perspective that makes the above kind of mistake.",2018-11-24 05:03:44,18520541
854,"You are only telling part of the story here.
What about the connect in the UI? mapStateToProps is called every single time the store is updated unless you provide a areStatesEqual function in each component you intend to connect to the store. This seems much more complicated that it should be.
I have a react native app that receives market data quotes in real time and I have used redux to store all those market data updates along other data and now I regret it.
If I had stored the data in POJOs and implement a very basic implementation of observer pattern would not only be more performant than would have been easier to implement. To connect the POJOs to the UI, I would only have created a smart component that connected to it and that&#x27;s it. No redux, redux-sagas, areStatesEqual, mapStateToProps, reselect and all that.

876,"Well, in order:<p>- I haven&#x27;t had any trouble using the RN css-like styles along with React-Navigation yet, what I&#x27;ve been writing looks consistent between devices, but I know I&#x27;ll hit that issue eventually<p>- My approach has been to just start making apps targeting real users, either from your own business or a client&#x27;s, there are several pretty good tutorials to get started, and the people who use what you create will let you know what&#x27;s important to focus on (and also motivate you to keep working!).<p>- The react native + navigation documentation is a great starting point, but you&#x27;ll still spend a while learning so your best bet is to partner up with a tutor and work alongside them to begin with, real experience is always where you get the most value at first.<p>- Kotlin is in an incredibly good place right now for Android development so I believe you can skip Java at first, and when the time comes when you need to check it out, you&#x27;ll find that it&#x27;s quite clear to make out and write with a Kotlin background. An IDE to hold your hand is always a plus as well.<p>Most of all, be sure to brush up on your basic algorithms and data structures, OOP design patterns, a dash of functional paradigm tools, mainstream architecture styles, and general good practices as you tackle on new technologies and you&#x27;ll find out that there&#x27;s a lot of overlap of all over the modern languages that translates directly.

The situation I ran into that instantly told me I needed global state management was when I had an index screen for list of resources, and a edit screen for a single resource. I knew I needed global state because I would edit a field of a single resource (like a todo&#x27;s title), save, and a successful edit would send me back to the index page of resources. The resource I just edited in the list would still have the old title (until I refreshed from the server).<p>So I would say if you have multiple screens&#x2F;routes manipulating the same set of data, that is when you will need global state management to make things work right. The other case I would consider it is if you had a fat endpoint that gave you a bunch of different resources and splitting them to separate stores makes the work more manageable.<p>I would love to know when others got that aha moment of &#x27;I definitely need flux at this point, and it would be really hard to do what I want without it&#x27;.",2019-01-05 06:13:27,18830269

Server can still render a React-Component-tree-like structure that will then be used in the client to render the actual component in react native.

912,"I was investigating typescript to use in a react native project and while checking some of the definitions contained in a package in Visual Studio Code (I believe it was react-navigation) the way they were presented was so confusing that I aborted immediately going with typescript. It was a function that returned a function that accepted as a parameter another function and the extra syntax was really taxing to my brain to fully understand what the function was all about.
When I removed the extra syntax it was way clearer for me to understand it. Sometimes, pure javascript with a good variable naming is better. Sure, I could use some of static type checking to avoid some bugs but there weren&#x27;t many bugs that I remember when I was doing the app so I think it didn&#x27;t impact me too much.
Also I am a solo developer in my company, I don&#x27;t work in a team so it&#x27;s not a big problem here.",2019-02-25 14:03:34,19245636
913,"I have developed in many static typed languages like C# and Java in my career but now I am being converted to web and mobile development so I know the advantages and disadvantages of a static type system. In my experience, I am much more productive in a dynamic instead of a static type system when implementing frontends.
For you to have an idea, this react native project I developed alone was sold to the client to be implemented in 3 months. The catch was I didn&#x27;t have any experience in mobile development and I was still developing another web project. So I had to learn react native, ios and android development as fast as possible to do a medium-sized app. Having more friction using typescript for me was a killer.<p>But for a backend I would certainly have used static types as it&#x27;s way more critical.",2019-02-26 09:43:52,19253084
