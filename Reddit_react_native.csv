0,"C'est uniquement sur expo il me semble, pas react native  proprement parler. Il faut cependant faire attention, je crois que create-react-app utilise expo. Il faudrait que je rejet un coup d'oeil aux docs

Et ce n'est pas sur react sans le native.",2018-12-01 10:20:41
1,"If you are looking for that level of filtering I'd suggest crunchbase API, there's a process to get a key but totally worth the trouble. As far as angelList I target few companies using the on-site filters manually, on load the script open all, click on founder(s) profile page and then activate voilanorbert fetch request, takes around 3 min for a thousand. 

For you specific needs, I don't see how are you going to target specific people I am only aware of the main search which returns companies, this is a list of enterprise software using react native https://angel.co/companies?markets[]=Enterprise+Software&amp;teches[]=React+Native

When looking at the company profile you'll see a bunch of divs, what I target is ''founders'' section, it's usually the decision makers, maybe ""employees"" would work better for you?

2,"React for sure, also allows you to transition into react native if needed for a certain project fairly easily. ",2018-12-12 17:05:14
3,"you can achieve a very high degree of code reuse if you separate business logic from rendering details. redux is one way to enforce that: https://reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/a5ke9u/devhubappdevhub_open_source_github_notifications/

personally i agree with the other poster - start with react native, then try using react-native-web instead of react-dom",2018-12-15 21:36:16
4,"you think people are gonna learn another language (Dart) to use it tho? I don't see it happening. People seem to be getting really tired of all of the current fragmentation. 

this is why I'm banking on react native/frameworks like Ionic which let you use the same codebase for web. Flutter probably gonna do something similar but having to learn Dart is a huge disadvantage",2018-12-27 17:09:48
