2,"As someone who is nearing completion of their react webapp (I love my server-side rendered react / redux / react-router / firebase stack) and will soon (in the next 2-3 months) begin porting to android / ios, this blog post made me feel like now is not a great time to be digging into react native because it will be fundamentally changing a lot, and that maybe its current architecture is difficult and archaic?

I have been looking closely at using flutter and dart. I'm not an expert on comparing the architectures, but it appears to have already solved the challenges that React Native is just starting to address with their re-architecture?
