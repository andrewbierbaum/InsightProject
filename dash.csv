19,"The reason microsoft pulled back on using .NET in the core of the OS is because of memory. Simply put, if the system runs out of memory, managed code with automatic memory management goes absolutely haywire and crashes, because it's allocating memory all over the place without the source code's knowledge without giving it an opportunity to handle out-of-memory conditions short of a storm of exceptions. This isn't great, but it's usually okay for applications -- they can't do much when the system is out of memory, anyway -- and application code is notorously careless about checking allocation success. But it's totally unacceptable for the core OS. Apparently, Microsoft originally thought they could deal with these issues, but ultimately they discovered that they couldn't.

There it is again -- the evil meme that somehow, someday soon, bandwidth will magically be free. Wireless bandwidth, no less!

It isn't true. Bandwidth is expensive. Physical infrastructure is expensive. Google will ultimately have to pay for their infrastructure somehow; if it is through ad support, it still isn't _free_ (even if it is free to you.)

A secondary evil meme is that bandwidth will effectively be infinite in the near future. Again, this is not true. Bandwidth hasn't scaled nearly as well as local storage capacity in the past two decades. We're heading towards a world where we keep the data near the CPU and use bandwidth and the ""cloud"" as a cache and for first-time data access.

23,"Scheme is a non-pure functional language. You can add things to scheme (as well as to common lisp) that allow type annotations. Common Lisp is NOT a functional language but can be made to act like one.

However, just because you can do something doesn't mean you should. Haskell does things for you that Scheme or Lisp would have to be heavily augmented to do. For one it is a pure functional language that enforces the lack of side effects through a strict type system. This makes some things possible such as STM (http://research.microsoft.com/~simonpj/papers/stm/stm.pdf)[PDF] . The Haskell type system forces STM atomicity to apply to side effect free code (check the paper for a good example).

Monadic programming is definitely possible in Scheme (http://okmij.org/ftp/Scheme/monad-in-Scheme.html) but with nowhere near the syntactic support that Haskell has.

Now all of that said, I've done a bit of work in Haskell and doing anything disk/IO intensive is a royal pain in the arse. Composing monads can be awfully confusing as well, which is what you end up having to do if you want to, say, add an error monad to an IO operation. It makes up for that sort of thing when you move on to more heavily algorithmic/logical programming.

For instance writing an evaluator in Haskell has to be one of the most pleasant experiences ever. Writing a simple lambda calc interpreter is close behind the factorial as far as the Haskell ""hello world"" app goes.

Check it out, it's gauranteed to make your brain twist around a bit and I would wager that even if you don't use it you'll come out with an expanded perspective.

www.microsoft.com, for example, doesn't offer a whole lot of software that you can download on the spot. However Synaptic does and provides a neat package to easily remove said software if you don't like it and update it when the time comes. In short package management is a far more elegant solution, you install/remove/update and can find a list of all the stuff on your system in one application. How is this less intuitive?

I have yet to encounter a linux error that I could not find a reasonable explanation of, usually swiftly followed by a remedey, this includes the apps I use on linux. 

Linux is not Windows (thank christ) just because it is free/gratis does not mean that there is no price to pay, you have to be willing to invest a little time learning how it works, same as any OS you are new to. There are a great many places to look for info and ask for help (I would go further and say that finding these places is easier if you are looking for the answer to a linux problem than a windows problem). 
For instance your complaint about getting XMMS to work (I assume you mean the mp3 codec) or videos to run in VLC (I assume you mean video codecs) or install a basic browser plugin (Java/Flash?), the answers to these and many more questions can be found on http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Dapper (changed a bit since I last used it but lots of the answers were back there then). This is a well known site in the ubuntu community www.ubuntuforums.org, which is linked to by the main site www.ubuntulinux.org.

DRM, in and of itself, is not a bad thing. If someone really wants that new Franz Ferdinand CD on a portable music player and it's DRM protected, they have no right to require the record label to unshackle it. DRM is not nearly as restrictive as the FSF makes it out to be; otherwise the iTunes music store would not be as popular as it is.

Of course, for simply showing how DRM is not as restrictive and destructive as Stallman likes to pretend, now you'll probably say I support DRM and proprietary software...

117,"My point was that the comment ""how much is a fully-functional copy of microsoft's OS which is still full of holes after god knows how long?"" was either an uninformed or deliberately false comparison.

If XP Home does not fit your definition of a ""fully-functional OS"" (and I would love to see a good reason why it shouldn't) then you can get XP Media Center for 109 or XP Pro for 149 at newegg. Otherwise it matches any version of OS X in price.

The security holes argument is a very complicated topic, and really is one I am not very interested in getting into. There *were* giant, glaring security issues in the past. There have not been any recently. Both operating systems have service packs and other updates that are pretty much required to keep things running correctly.

118,"ahh, i see. i wasn't clear.

the point i was trying to make is that i think the meaningful comparison should be between 10.3, which was relatively secure at release and is still compatible/supported, and the original version of XP Pro (or SP2, if you like), which has been continually patched since its release and still isn't all that great. -- point is, it took a while to get that way, whereas it's included in the price of a new apple os, if that makes sense. and it's more expensive. for a new version of xp pro, you could get 3 OSXes.

the short version is that if you don't want to upgrade, you don't have to, and you still have a fully-functional OS that's still arguably superior to microsoft's working release.

When GetEnumerator() is called, it will pick up where it left off, and execute the next loop until it reaches yield again -- and so on until the loop completes. Remembering its state in this way is a continuation, because the method continues from where it left off.

Also, it makes it easier from a hardware perspective, not cluttering your systems with tons of drive cables, less limited in expandibility.

160,"The main advantage of STM above locks is that they compose. It is best explained in the paper: [Compasable Memory Transactions](http://research.microsoft.com/Users/simonpj/papers/stm/stm.pdf):

&gt;...Perhaps the most fundamental
objection, though, is that lock-based programs do not compose:
correct fragments may fail when combined.
&gt;
For example, consider a hash table with thread-safe insert and
delete operations. Now suppose that we want to delete one item A
from table t1, and insert it into table t2; but the intermediate state
(in which neither table contains the item) must not be visible to
other threads. Unless the implementor of the hash table anticipates
this need, there is simply no way to satisfy this requirement. Even if
she does, all she can do is expose methods such as LockTable and
UnlockTable  but as well as breaking the hash-table abstraction,
they invite lock-induced deadlock, depending on the order in which
the client takes the locks, or race conditions if the client forgets.
Yet more complexity is required if the client wants to await the
presence of A in t1, but this blocking behaviour must not lock
the table (else A cannot be inserted). In short, operations that are
individually correct (insert, delete) cannot be composed into larger
correct operations.
&gt;
The same phenomenon shows up trying to compose alternative
blocking operations. Suppose a procedure p1 waits for one of two
input pipes to have data, using an internal call to the Unix select
procedure; and suppose another procedure p2 does the same thing,
on two different pipes. In Unix there is no way to perform a select
between p1 and p2, a fundamental loss of compositionality. Instead,
Unix programmers learn awkward programming techniques
to gather up all the file descriptors that must be waited for, perform
a single top-level select, and then dispatch back to the correct
handler. Again, two individually-correct abstractions, p1 and p2,
cannot be composed into a larger one; instead, they must be ripped
apart and awkwardly merged, in direct conflict with the goals of
abstraction.
&gt;
Rather than fixing locks, a more promising and radical alternative
is to base concurrency control on atomic memory transactions,
also known as transactional memory. We will show that transactional
memory offers a solution to the tension between concurrency
and abstraction. For example, with memory transactions we can
manipulate the hash table thus:
&gt;
`atomic { v:=delete(t1,A); insert(t2,A,v) }`
&gt;
and to wait for either p1 or p2 we can say
&gt;
`atomic { p1 orElse p2 }`
&gt;
These simple constructions require no knowledge of the implementation
of insert, delete, p1, or p2, and they continue to work
correctly if these operations may block, as we shall see...",2006-09-20 11:27:46

3. companies with a ""patent portfolio"" probably don't want to use free software anyway. deciding what your freedoms should be based on what's good for big business is far more disturbing than unanticpated consequences of contract language intend to counteract DRM. companies who use the term ""patent portfolio"" probably also like DRM, proprietary software, oracle, and microsoft.

169,"Looks a bit like some ready-made article delivered my MSFT PR dept and delivered verbatim by the journalist.

There are a couple of key points which aren't considered here:

* microsoft consistently proved itself unable to deliver a usable product before version 3 or 4. I don't see why it would change with zune. If you were to believe microsoft PR, Windows 95 would have made OSX pointless.

* they compare ipods from last year with zunes from next year. Apple does have new ipods in the tubes, and new ones will follow; those surely will integrate zune's most desirable features, plus some new, awesome ones: apple is unquestionnably much better than microsoft at shipping those original features without which you can't live, once you've tried them for 2 days. And they're trained at releasing a substancially new ipod product every 18 months or so. Do I need to talk about microsoft's product shipping cycle?

Essentially, a full screen video ipod, with a virtual control wheel and wireless capabilities, will crush zune technically.

One point is left for zune: medias. If microsoft manages to get exclusive rights with major RIAA members, *that* might badly hurt Apple.

Nevertheless, I'd love to see some non-ridiculous competition against ipods. I'm sure they can provide even greater products, if pressured adequately :)",2006-10-01 10:33:08
170,"I'm with you in priciple. However, bitmapped fonts offer one thing that outline fonts dont: simplicity of implementation.

You can pretty much produce a bitmapped font at a normal size and then scale it. Then tweak the stuff that got messed up. Time consuming but simple. It's akin to a cut-and-paste approach.

Outline fonts are definitely more sophisticated since they benefit from hinting of glyphs. They are pretty much guaranteed to work at all readable resolutions IFF the designer took the time to hint properly. The problem is that hinting is a complex and iterative process. You need to be a mix of graphic artist and computer programmer. Something that isn't commonly found.

Anyway, I was looking at Microsoft's Visual TrueType software. It's an attempt to make the hinting process less of a programming task. However, even hinting things visually/graphically still means that you need a strong understanding of type and how scaling can affect readability and character relationships.

178,"That's hard to answer.

There are some design patterns that are not expressible in C++. But that is off-topic, so we will drop it for now. 

Some patterns in C++ could be replaced with libraries. Once you do that, you don't need the pattern any more. But this only counts if the standard library has the feature. If everyone has to create their own version, then you haven't really conquored the design pattern.

Other patterns can be elminated with enchancements to the language. Macros in C++ server this role. But again, it only counts if everyone has access to the same common set. 

Finally, there are the patterns simply must be carried out over and over again. Some patterns, like explicit memory management, cannot easily be placed in a library. The only way to eliminate the pattern is to fundementally change the language.

There have been attempts to iterator pattern (for-each) in C++ libraries. But many people find them to be clumsy and somewhat worse than the original pattern. While adding a for-each construct to C++ would not be a fundemental change, it is certainly more involved than just creating a library.

Eariler I mentioned that C++ simply cannot express some patterns. Here is an example:

Consider the ""Create some XML"" design patterns. You basically have two choices, either using strings or objects. 

The strings option requires you to manually escape text and ensure the tage are balanced. And when you are done, all you have is a string.

The object option requires you to manually create objects for every element, and in many libraries for every attribute. This can be very tedious, even in a language that uses garbage collection.

VB9 elminates the headaches of both these introducing a new syntax:

    Dim myXml = &lt;tag1 attribute1=""&lt;%= someValue %&gt;""&gt; &lt;innerElement1/&gt; &lt;innerElement2&gt;&lt;%= someCollection %&gt; &lt;/innerElement&gt;  &lt;/tag1&gt;

There is no way to express this in C++ or any other OO language via libraries. Even functional langauges cannot do this directly; though they can get close, you still have to do some translation.

Has VB eliminate the need for design patterns? No, but is has replaced it with a simplier one.

Interesting quotes:

&gt; the fact that that product [Linux] uses our patented intellectual property is a problem for our shareholders.

&gt; [...]

&gt; And we agreed on a, we call it an IP bridge, essentially an arrangement under which they pay us some money for the right to tell the customer that anybody who uses Suse Linux is appropriately covered. There will be no patent issues. They've appropriately compensated Microsoft for our intellectual property, which is important to us. In a sense you could say anybody who has got Linux in their data center today sort of has an undisclosed balance sheet liability, because it's not just Microsoft patents. Because of the way open-source works, there's nobody who's been able to do patent coverage or patent indemnification behind that.

&gt; [...]

&gt; ""What we agreed, which is true, is we'll continue to try to grow Windows share at the expense of Linux. That's kind of our job. But to the degree that people are going to deploy Linux, we want Suse Linux to have the highest percent share of that, because only a customer who has Suse Linux actually has paid properly for the use of intellectual property from Microsoft.

So, apparently, 

* Yes, they're pulling a SCO.
* It seems it will be patent-based, not copyright-based.  That's bad.  These days almost any large piece of software infriges some (stupid) patents.
* No information yet on exactly which part of ""Linux"" is ""infringing"", but rumors on the web talk about Mono and Samba.
* Novell chose to pay the fee to the troll on the bridge.  Time to boycott Novell.  MS wants you to use Suse.  Suse users: this is a good time to move to Ubuntu.

Otherwise they would get their way by persistent litigation just as they did against the justice department when it came to the antitrust case that was being brought against them.

These threats may very well have validity, but it's going to be a matter of showing the code, and that is something that microsoft and it's legal arms have been unwilling to do.  I hope that there is no teeth to their claims, but until the code is revealed and our legal system is allowed to go over it with a fine tooth comb, these are just idle threats. I hope that this is all the ever amount to.",2006-11-21 21:52:42

236,"Novell agreed to pay MS not to sue its customers; MS agreed to pay Novell not to sue its customers [[1](http://www.novell.com/news/press/item.jsp?id=1196)]. Novell did not admit any patent infringement in the software they distribute. They're not planning to start using MS's patents in the software they make, distribute, or contribute [[2](http://www.novell.com/linux/microsoft/community_open_letter.html)].

Some are worried that this deal is in violation of Novell's obligations under section 7 of the [GPL](http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/gpl.html). Eben Moglen of FSF is one of these.

I understand the concern to be that Novell's assent to this agreement could be construed to imply that Novell believes there is some danger due to patent infringement. Why else seek a covenant from Microsoft wherein MSFT promises not to sue? But we know that our court system can be and has been abused. A company like Microsoft could conceivably decide to throw a few million dollars at frivolous lawsuits against users. So, if Microsoft offers to promise not to file such lawsuits, why not take them up on it?

In this deal, Novell actually gets more money than Microsoft. So, assuming that it can be shown that the deal does not constitute an admission by Novell of patent infringement, it:

 * protects Novell customers from baseless (but temporarily expensive!) lawsuits.
 * assures Novell customers who are prone to irrational fears that they'll be OK
 * has no effect on anyone besides Novell, Microsoft, and their customers
 * increases Novell's net income.

The negative publicity might be the only thing wrong with this deal.

Novell has been fighting the good fight against SCO for some time now. Let Moglen and the lawyers settle the fine legal point here. Those of us who are not lawyers should give them the benefit of the doubt on this.",2006-11-22 04:26:02

239,"Let's take a step back in time; back to the mid- to late 1980s. After microsoft had worked with apple on some of their software (most notably the original calculator program on the orig. Mac), they started brewing Windows. 

Steve was furious. Why were they stealing the GUI away? There was much litigation, and court cases concerning what was being stolen and what was being 'created'. Apple could not prove anything was taken, and windows was allowed to continue. The WIMP we know and love, given to Apple by Xerox, was to lead to windows eventually.

Also, what microsoft did when working with IBM on OS/2. Compare OS/2 2.0 or so to Windows 3.1. www.guidebookgallery.com

During these time, there were few patents concerning the way applications worked, not how they were coded. 

I hate software patents. They are basically thoughts. It's not the same as a copyright; protection against exacty replication of your code. You just own the right to thinking about a problem in a certain way, which is ridiculous. Sure, it's great to receive compensation for your ideas, and even better when you don't have large, strong-armed software companies ripping off your ideas (i'm looking at your MS), but what recourse to some have?

Apple learned their lesson, and sticks a patent on anything they can. IBM simply lost this battle. 

In essence, software patents have created a stable and burgeoning class of thought-crime. Next up are all the sorting routines; no new ones, but just the old ones. They are probably in the patent pipeline right now.

241,"you would probably avoid being flamed by not insinuating that apple users are sheep and calling them fanboys. apple's advertising certainly doesn't hurt ipod sales, but the fact of the matter is, the ipod is a very well designed piece of kit that is exceptionally simple to use. it is not the be-all-end-all of audio players, but for 90% of the consumer public it does exactly what they want.

i would like to correct you on a few things though, neither AAC or H.264 are quicktime formats they are codecs which apple happens to support through their quicktime media layer. apple does not own AAC or H.264.

as for the DRM, the stink is two-fold in my opinion. the first comes from the zune's insistence on applying DRM to all files transferred from zune to zune, regardless of where they were purchased/created. the second comes from microsoft's extortion payment to universal -- the $1 dollar per unit ""theft fee"". for the second reason alone i want the zune to fail miserably, i would hate for the license fee to a music company to become an industry standard.

as for the zune itself, there's really not much to be excited about. it does nothing that competing players don't already do (wifi, video, nice design). you make mention of the ipod's success having to do with their advertising, but the zune suffers from the same glitch, there is nothing about the player other than microsoft's $100 million advertising campaign to differentiate it from the creative, apple, sandisk offerings. it's nothing more than a competent DAP.",2006-11-26 20:59:20
242,"&gt;An illegal version or a (hypothetical) complete knock-off would work just fine.

You obviously dont remember CPU's by cyrix. There is a reason Intel says Genuine Intel on it. They were close in functionality but not the same. Your example of a knock off would be using open source code, where it was exactly the same. Otherwise UNgenuine microsoft windows would have to be reverse engineered - with probably some (alot of?) loss of functionality/interoperability.

Software IP should be credited, but people should release their software free - and only make people pay for feature requests and the like. If everything was open source, software would get to a point where it was all the best it could be. I don't want to be stuck using microsoft windows becuase its what microsoft considers to be ""the best"". If people could get in there and actually make it the best, everyone benefits. 


Software development needs to move to more of a maintence roll. Think of it like this. Company A hires a programmer to develop a feature, company B does the same for the same feature. Now how much manpower is wasted developing two identical features independantly? Sure its good for the devs that 2 people are getting paid to do the work of one, but its not good for society and the progression of good software in general. Company B could have redirected its efforts into another area, used the effort by company A in its own products, and vice versa.


Of course no one here likes it when you say ""just as music will continue to be made without financial incentive, so will software"" because most people reading these sorts of boards are developers and want to stay employed. It doesn't make it any less true though, and I think that you do end up with a far better product under an open source model.",2006-11-26 22:07:15

One may (if even more desperate) say they have been innovative in the ways they have integrated and improved those products since acquiring them: however in most cases I think you will find that his innovation has been extremely minimal to say the least.

Another interesting study would be to see how these licensed and purchased companies faired in their deals with microsoft. I know a few in that list were brutally screwed over in one way or another... i suspect probably more were.

Any action which wishes to do something different based on state will have to explicitly pull in a state variable from somewhere, which looks very different from getting a function parameter. Also, ordinary evaluation doesn't cause any side effects -- all the actions which are composed by the function are somewhat akin to code which is interpreted by another function and which can check various consistency properties as it executes it.

Check out [HAppS](http://happs.org/HAppS/README.html) which is a good example of using a monad in order to enforce [ACID](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID) properties.

The point is, functional languages don't completely discourage state when it's really the right model for things, but functional programmers tend to be really quite picky when they're going to use it at all about how nicely the abstraction is implemented -- how many checks and assurances are in place that the variables being threaded through a computation will not have things done to them which put them in an inconsistent state.

As a vast generalisation of imperative programming (extending quite often to the point where it no longer appears to be imperative programming), monadic programming allows one to do everything that one might do in an imperative language, but to build in additional safety requirements.

As for whether state really is the right model, well, perhaps not for all applications, but it seems that it's an at least halfway decent way to deal with the need to manage persistence in the face of a stateless protocol. Some applications might work out better with some form of stream-based interface, where certain streams are opened up at the beginning of the program, and read from and written to in a roughly FIFO manner.

Another, rather different approach is to use continuations to manage the future of user sessions. This is an approach taken by [WASH](http://www.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~thiemann/haskell/WASH/)  and perhaps more famously, the [PLT Scheme](http://www.plt-scheme.org/) [web server](http://download.plt-scheme.org/doc/360/html/web-server/)

It allows one to treat entire user sessions as single continuous programs without having to manage restoring the session state and future of the computation by hand every step of the way. [Shriram Krishnamurthi](http://www.cs.brown.edu/~sk/) has a [rather good video of a talk given to Microsoft](http://download.microsoft.com/download/9/4/1/94138e2a-d9dc-435a-9240-bcd985bf5bd7/Shriram.wmv) regarding this technique and some of the more recent stuff which he's been working on for ajax, in which he tries very hard to pretend not to love functional and declarative programming.",2006-12-12 02:45:07

277,"I disagree with this article in a bunch of small ways, and it really looks to me, from looking at the abstract of the talk referred to, that various points might have been misunderstood.

Firstly, it is possible to get a wide variety of guarantees of compositionality in transactional memory systems. [Haskell's STM library](http://research.microsoft.com/~simonpj/papers/stm/index.htm) does quite a good job of providing a fair degree of compositionality guarantees, for instance. It does not support nested transactions, but if nested transactions make compositionality hard to obtain, perhaps they are the wrong idea.

Certainly, you can't completely eliminate problems with deadlock, there are still ways for a program to request impossible uses of resources, but these systems do eliminate many many sources of these problems.

There's a parallel situation with type systems. Good type systems like those in Haskell, ML, Scala, etc. don't magically catch all your bugs, but they do help eliminate wide classes of bugs which may arise before they become real problems, freeing more time for programmers to worry about the more subtle bugs.

Indeed, we really need many idioms and ways of looking at parallelism and concurrency. Locks are not a terribly useful substrate on which to build libraries, and anyone who has tried to use that model understands why this is difficult. I agree with the speakers that automatic translation of lock-based code is very likely to be problematic.

However, the ability to mark code such that it runs as-if-atomically, (perhaps together with some variety of means of combining transactions) is exactly the sort of abstraction which will allow development to move forward in terms of higher-level libraries, while compiler authors and hardware manufacturers work out better and better ways to run these ""atomic"" blocks in parallel to gain performance without damaging the semantic guarantees which have been set up.

There are various potential design flaws which we have to be careful not to put into our foundations. Transactions should never have intermittent side effects visible before their completion, nor should the effects of any other concurrently running processes be visible from within them. They should behave as if they ran atomically -- when they fail, it should be as if nothing had happened at all. That's the whole point of them being transactions. This means that they cannot have side effects which cannot be rolled back in the case of failure (notably I/O). Of course, it's possible to design systems where transactions queue and/or trigger I/O to occur after they've completed.

So I think the tone of the article is a little more negative than is probably appropriate. Yes, there are migration issues if you want to translate lock based code mechanically to use transactions. Yes, there are design choices which must be made carefully. Overall, however, transactions form a much nicer semantic substrate than locks, and will allow a great deal of progress to occur in terms of higher level libraries, as well as lower level performance optimisations.",2006-12-19 22:48:55
278,"This isn;t the exact topic for this, but here's something that's been on my mind lately.  I have used many varieties of Macs over the years, and everyone I know right now has a Mac laptop.  Macs are great.  But on the other hand I went to fry's 2 1/2 years ago and built a desktop PC with a single core 3GHZ CPU and 1 gig of ram running windows XP.  I still have the snappiest, most reliable computer out of everyone.  And this isn't just my opinion. My computer has NEVER frozen, except for when I had a bad memory stick.

286,"Erlang and Perl.  But I feel that I'd communicate better if I explained why I don't hold some of these other languages as my language of choice:

Not python. Although someone calls it elegant and maintainable in this thread, and people often declare that they have an easy time reading it, I hold little faith for any of these attributes.  For inelegance, Python offers explicit returns, a destructive *array sort* among its crimes against functional programming, bizarre scoping, a pointlessly limited lambda, and disk-cached bytecode that never seems to help with anything.  For unmaintainability and unreadability, Python has the result of its cultural and linguistic biases: huge, undifferentiatable swaths of code, indented to the horizontal stratosphere, offering the bewildered eye on every *line* a singularly clear statement of code that helps to form an inpenetrable *block* of code -- and all of it massaged, with referential transparency or clear interaction completely out the window, into idiotically-named objects in a chaotic, undocumented heirarchy.  I've hacked on Python programs, but you can dive in, make a change, and flee from any codebase: Python on whole only stands in the way of a maintainer trying to understand a codebase.

Not ruby. I *used* to like Ruby -- back when matz still wrote the English documentation and it had the primary hypes of 'Look at how reflective and pretty it is!' and the primary criticism of 'I cannot accept that it has so many ends!'.  I thought then that it might be a 'better Perl' -- but since then, Perl has itself turned into 'better Perl', and Ruby has improved only in that it now has jobs.

Not Ruby or Python: they have manners of development identical to Perl.  They have plusses and contrasts-to-other-languages identical to Perl's.  Their communities fall ill to memes largely identically to Perl's.  They are effectively one language, with a winner-takes-all relationship as far as devotees go.  For me, Perl won.  I can go back and learn the new tricks Python has come up with -- and probably will, when I need to deal with a nifty python program, but this would otherwise only waste time that I could better spend on constantly-there languages -- and on novel languages.

Not Haskell.  'Haskell' effectively means 'GHC', and the last release of GHC had (cout'em:) three supported platforms.  Ah, great, you can upgrade with an older GHC -- so however many few platforms in addition that this comes to.  Ah, even better, you can take GHC on one platform and cross-compile to another platform, somehow, producing C code that you can then massage, somehow, and then compile on that another platform.  No, until the Haskell community gets serious about portability, I for the most part *simply can't* use it.  When I have used it, it has competed with better-documented, vastly more-portable, plainly better-engineered O'Caml.

Not Factor.  See complaints about GHC.

Not D.  I don't care about C++, better C++'s, or any manner of not-very-different better-than-Cs.  C itself I care about only insofar as I find that many interesting programs use it, that C programs themselves always seem to come packaged with sincere efforts to make them portable throughout unix, that having languages that can hook into C allows me to interact in very interesting ways with aforementioned interesting C programs.  C is a useful, but not a great language, and nothing that tries to position itself as a superset (of a superset...) of C can interest me very much.

Speaking of which, not C++.  Or C#.

Not Java.  I don't want to touch a language so fearsome that it has spawned its own industry of code-mucking tools.  Even if I did: no Java program interests me very much, and see my complaints about GHC.

Not PHP.  Nobody who has put effort into any of Perl, Python, or Ruby can have anything but little-adulterated contempt for this hackish, obscene ball of mud.  From core to extensions to community to documentation to popular programs -- *burn it all*.  Even someone not so immunized against this language should be able follow http://tnx.nl/php

Not APL.  See complaints about GHC, and then pretend furthermore that GHC is a closed-source program purveyed by people who won't even list a price.

Not BASIC.  But the person suggested that as a joke, I guess.

Not any kind of Pascal.  By negative bias from two imperfect sources: http://www.lysator.liu.se/c/bwk-on-pascal.html and the footnote on this page http://www.ugcs.caltech.edu/manuals/lang/gforth-0.6.2/Structure-Usage.html

Not Objective C.  See complaints about D.

Not assembly.  Because I know Forth.

Not JavaScript.  I like it, and it amuses me that it's the only programming language you can rely on in the world of desolate microsoft systems -- but it seems that I only ever use it to dumbly polish what I generate with Perl.  If I didn't need to generate even the most basic data for JavaScript, due to its lack of multiline string literals or HERE docs, maybe then I could care enough to do some moderately actual work with it.

Not JScript.  Oh, you meant this instead of JavaScript?  I have nothing to do with windows programming, so: no need.  If someone threatened assault unless I produce a win32 program, I'd probably use Erlang or REBOL.  Or Emacs -- hah!

Not nude celebrities.  These are poorly composable, worse even than assembly in getting something done.  I can't even fathom why you'd choose it.

Not like that.  Please do it this way: `sub perl_does_not_care { shift + 1 }`

Finally, two small notes about my languages of choice.  Perl has unmatched wealths in CPAN, in its electronic documentation and its written books, in the expertise and charitableness of its commmunity, and simply in its growth and history: it has over time developed features and worn away deficiencies in a manner far and away above that of any language in any context.

Of Erlang, I'll say: it does not offer simply lots of processes, nor even just asynchronous concurrency with message-passing, nor only hot-code loading and multiple versions of modules; it is merely supremely good at processes, or distributed fault-tolerant soft-real-time systems; it is not merely good at telephony applications.  I can't explain the depth of solid, cohesive engineering in Erlang that makes me roll my eyes when someone posits that e.g., Python has some of these features.  I used Erlang for quite a while before I discovered the sweet-spot of hacking with it, where classic cycles (edit-&gt;run-&gt;debug) of programming fold away and I'm left with something almost absurdly fast and responsive, that nobody has given me a cutely hyped term for.

That's all.  Some derisiveness and some bitterness and some praise undifferentiable from religion.  You probably wanted more flame than you've gotten, so far.
