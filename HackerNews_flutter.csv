9,"Glider pilot here. I have decent knowledge of aerodynamics, but have never studied large jets in detail. This is my personal theory - essentially what lies behind the words of a few articles I have read over the last few days, but the authors haven't been able to formulate it clearly.<p>Assuming that the autopilot and fly-by-wire systems were somehow compromized, a full stall in the ""Coffin Corner"" (Q-corner) would be a very, very serious condition. A stall causes the nose to drop and speed to accumulate. Since the difference between the stalling speed and the never-exceed speed is so small at the altitude in question, this accumulation of speed could easily cause the plane to exceed its critical Mach number, causing supersonic shockwaves around certain parts of the airfoil. In planes not designed for supersonic flight, these shockwaves will eventually cripple the effect of the control surfaces. If the plane is in a nose-down position when it looses effect on its elevator rudder, the plane will overspeed and eventually suffer structural failure (essentially meaning the loss of some critical part) due to flutter (resonance in parts of the airframe) or aerodynamic stresses.<p>A stall during normal flight conditions doesn't have to be a serious problem, but these weren't normal flight conditions. And the information that we have suggests that certain Airbus models have had problems with their pitot (speed measurement) systems in icing conditions, leading to erroneous speed readouts. The fly-by-wire system, which prevents the pilot from flying the aircraft into stall or overspeed, cannot function correctly without a correct speed measurement. And as I have detailed, a proper stall might be enough to doom the airplane.",2009-06-09 13:23:33,649023
10,"PERFECT FAILURE<p>COMMENCEMENT ADDRESS TO GRADUATING CLASS OF
THE BUCKLEY SCHOOL<p>June 10, 2009<p>When I was asked to give the commencement address to a
graduating class of 9th graders, I jumped at the chance. You see, I
have four teenagers of my own and I feel like this is the point in
my life when I am supposed to tell them something profound. So
thank you Buckley community for giving me this opportunity. I
tried this speech out on them last night and am happy to report that
none of them fell asleep until I was three quarters done.<p>When composing this message I searched my memory for my
same experience back in 1969 when I was sitting right where you
are. I realized that I could hardly remember one single speaker
from my junior high or high school days. Now that could be my
age. Im old enough now that some days I cant remember how old
I am. But it could also have been a sign of the times. Remember, I
was part of the student rebellion, and we did not listen to anything
that someone over 30 said because they were just too clueless. Or
so we thought.<p>Anyway, as I sat there considering this speech further, I
suddenly had a flashback of the one speaker who I actually did
remember from youthful days. He was a Shakespearean actor who
came to our school to extol the virtues of Shakespeare. He started
out by telling us that Shakespeare was not about poetry or romance
or love, but instead, was all about battle, and fighting and death
and war. Then he pulled out a huge sword which he began waving
over the top of his head as he described various bloody conflicts
that were all part and parcel of Shakespeares plays. Now being a
15-year old testosterone laden student at an all boys school, I
thought this was pretty cool. I remember thinking, Yea, this guy
gets it. Forget about the deep meaning and messages in the words,
lets talk about whos getting the blade.<p>As you can see, I have a similar sword which I am going to
stop waving over my head now, because A) I think you are
permanently scarred, and B) the headmaster looks like he is about
to tackle me and C) some of you, I can tell, are way too excited
about this sword, and youre scaring me a little.<p>Im here with you young men today because your parents
wanted me to speak to you about servicethat is, serving others
and giving back to the broader community for the blessings that
you have received in your life. But that is a speech for a later time
in your life. Dont get me wrong, serving others is really, really
important. It truly is the secret to happiness in life. I swear to God.
Money wont do it. Fame wont do it. Nor will sex, drugs,
homeruns or high achievement. But now I am getting preachy.<p>Today, I want to talk to you about the dirtiest word that any
of you 9th graders know. Its a word that is so terrible that your
parents wont talk about it; your teachers wont talk about it; and
you certainly dont ever want to dwell on it. But this is a
preparatory school, and you need to be prepared to deal with this
phenomenon because you will experience it. That is a guarantee.
Every single one of you will experience it not once but multiple
times, and every adult in this room has had to deal with this in its
many forms and manifestations. Its the F word.<p>FAILURE. Failure that is so mortifying and so devastating
that it makes you try to become invisible. It makes you want to
hide your face, your soul, your being from everyone else because
of the shame. Trust me, boysif you havent already tasted that,
you will. I am sure most of you here already have. AND IT IS
HARD. I know this firsthand, but I also know that failure was a
key element to my lifes journey.<p>My first real failure was in 1966 in the 6th grade. I played on
our basketball team, and I was the smallest and youngest kid on the
team. It was the last game of the season and I was the only player
on the squad that had not scored a point all season. So in the
second half the coach directed all the kids to throw me the ball
when I went in, and for me to shoot so that I would score. The
problem was that Coach Clark said it loud enough that every
person in the stands could hear it as well as every member of the
opposing team. Going into the fourth quarter, our team was well
ahead, Coach Clark inserted me and thus, began the worst eight
minutes of my life up until that point. Every time I got the ball, the
entire other team would rush towards me, and on top of that, that
afternoon I was the greatest brick layer the world had ever seen.
The game ended. I had missed five shots, and the other team
erupted in jubilation that I had not scored. I ran out of the gym as
fast as I could only to bump into two of the opposing teams
players who proceeded to laugh and tease and ridicule me. I cried
and hid in the bathroom. Well, that passed, and I kept trying team
sports, but I was just too small to really compete. So in the 10th
grade, I took up boxing where suddenly everyone was my size and
weight. I nearly won the Memphis Golden Gloves my senior year
in high school and did win the collegiate championship when I was
19. Standing in the middle of that ring and getting that trophy, I
still remember looking around for those two little kids who had run
me into that bathroom back in the 6th grade, because I was going to
knock their blocks off. Thats one problem with failure. It can
stay with you for a very long time.<p>The next time the dragon of failure reared his ugly head was
in 1978. I was working in New Orleans for one of the greatest
cotton traders of all time, Eli Tullis. Now, New Orleans is an
unbelievable city. It has the Strawberry Festival, the Jazz Festival,
the Sugar Bowl, Mardi Gras, and just about every other excuse for
a party that you can ever imagine. Heck, in that town, waking up
was an excuse to party. I was still pretty fresh out of college, and
my mentality, unfortunately, was still firmly set on fraternity row.
It was a Friday morning in June, and I had been out literally all
night with a bunch of my friends. My job was to man the phone all
day during trading hours and call cotton prices quotes from New
York into Mr. Tullis office. Around noon, things got quiet on the
New York floor, and I got overly drowsy. The next thing I
remember was a ruler prying my chin off my chest, and Mr. Tullis
calling to me, Paul. Paul. My eyes fluttered opened and as I
came to my senses, he said to me, Son, you are fired. Id never
been so shocked or hurt in my life. I literally thought I was going
to die for I had just been sacked by an iconic figure in my business.<p>My shame turned into anger. I was not angry at Mr. Tullis for
he was right. I was angry at myself. But I knew I was not a
failure, and I swore that I was going to prove to myself that I could
be a success. I called a friend and secured a job on the floor of the
New York Cotton Exchange and moved to the City. Today, I will
put my work ethic up against anybodys on Wall Street. Failure
will give you a tattoo that will stay with you your whole life, and
sometimes its a really good thing. One other side note, to this day,
Ive never told my parents that I got fired. I told them I just
wanted to try something different. Shame can be a lifetime
companion for which you better prepare yourself.<p>Now, there are two types of failure you will experience in
life. The first type is what I just described and comes from things
you can control. That is the worst kind. But there is another form
of failure that will be equally devastating to you, and that is the
kind beyond your control. This happened to me in 1982. I had met
a very lovely young Harvard student from Connecticut, dated her
for two years then asked her to marry me right after she graduated
from college. We set a date; we sent out the invitations; and all
was fantastic until one month before the wedding when her father
called me. He said, Paul, my daughter sat me down this
afternoon, and she doesnt know how to tell you this, but she is
really unhappy and thinks its time for you two to take a break.
At first I thought he was joking because he was a very funny guy.
Then he said, No, she is serious about this. I thought to myself,
Oh, my God, I am being dumped at the altar. Im from
Tennessee. Getting dumped at the altar was the supreme social
embarrassment of that time. It was a big deal. When all my family
and friends found out, they were ready to re-start the Civil War on
the spot. I had to remind them that the last Civil War didnt go so
well for our side, and I didnt like our chances in a rematch. The
reality was that I was a 26-year old knucklehead, and since all my
friends were getting married, I kind of felt it was time for me to do
the same thing. And that was the worst reason in the world to get
married. I actually think she understood that and to a certain
extent spared me what would have been a very tough marriage.
Instead, Ive had an incredible marriage for twenty years to a
wonderful wife, and we have four kids that I love more than
anything on Earth. Some things happen to you that at the time will
make you feel like the world is coming to an end, but in actuality,
there is a very good reason for it. You just cant see it and dont
know it. When one door closes, another will open, but standing in
that hallway can be hell. You just have to persevere. Quite often
that dragon of failure is really chasing you off the wrong road and
on to the right one.<p>By now you are thinking, how much longer is this loser
going to keep on talking. My kids are all teenagers, and whenever
Im telling them something I think is important, they often wonder
the same thing. But the main point I want you to take away today
is that some of your greatest successes are going to be the children
of failure. This touches upon the original reason I was invited
here today. In 1986, I adopted a class of Bedford Stuyvesant 6th
graders and promised them if they graduated from high school, I
would pay for their college. For those of you who dont know,
Bed-Stuy is one of New York Citys toughest neighborhoods. Even
the rats are scared to go there at night. Statistically about 8% of
the class I adopted would graduate from high school, so my
intervention was designed to get them all into college. For the next
six years, I did everything I could for them. I spent about $5,000
annually per student taking them on ski trips, taking them to
Africa, taking them to my home in Virginia on the weekends,
having report card night, hiring a counselor to help coordinate
afternoon activities and doing my heartfelt best to get them ready
for college. Six years later, a researcher from Harvard contacted
me and asked if he could study my kids as part of an overall
assessment of what then was called the I Have a Dream
Program. I said sure. He came back to me a few months later
and shared some really disturbing statistics. 86 kids that I had
poured my heart and soul into for six years were statistically no
different than kids from a nearby school that did not have the
services our afterschool program provided. There was no
difference in graduation rates, dropout rates, academic scores,
teenage pregnancies, and the list went on. The only thing that we
managed to do was get three times as many of our kids into college
because we were offering scholarships whereas the other schools
were not. But in terms of preparing these kids for college, we
completely and totally failed. Boy, did this open my eyes. That
was the first real-time example for me of how intellectual capital
will always trump financial capital. In other words, I had the
money to help these kids, but it was useless because I didnt have
the brains to help them. I had tried to succeed with sheer force of
will and energy and financial resources. I learned that this was not
enough. What I needed were better defined goals, better metrics,
and most importantly, more efficient technologies that would
enable me to achieve those goals. What that whole experience
taught me was that starting with kids at age 12 was 12 years too
late. An afterschool program was actually putting a band-aid on a
much deeper structural issue, and that was that our public
education system was failing us. So in 2000, along with the
greatest educator I knew, a young man named Norman Atkins, we
started the Excellence Charter School in Bedford Stuyvesant for
boys. We set the explicit goal of hiring the best teachers with the
greatest set of skills to be the top performing school in the city.
Now that was an ambitious goal but last year in 2008, Excellence
ranked #1 out of 543 public schools in New York City for reading
and math proficiency for any third and fourth grade cohort, and our
school was 98% African American boys. We never would have
done that had I not failed almost 15 years earlier.<p>So here is the point: you are going to meet the dragon of
failure in your life. You may not get into the school you want or
you may get kicked out of the school you are in. You may get your
heart broken by the girl of your dreams or God forbid, get into an
accident beyond your control. But the point is that everything
happens for a reason. At the time it may not be clear. And
certainly the pain and the shame are going to be overwhelming and
devastating. But just as sure as the sun comes up, there will come
a time on the next day or the next week or the next year, when you
will grab that sword and point it at that dragon and tell him, Be
gone, dragon. Tarry with me and I will cut your head off. For I
must find the destination God and life hold in store for me!

Someone can write a computer program that will run detailed mathematical models of a bridge and cross-check against established data.

Thought error (I didn't understand the problem or I goofed in my reasoning about it).<p>I'd argue, therefore, that the 'stupid' errors are the errors that can be solved by software engineering.
(Using higher level languages, better compilers, better type systems, etc.) The issue being that there is only so much that you can actually do to solve them with software.<p>The second set is a bit more difficult. Am I going to validate my bridge simulator by using a different bridge simulator? Sometimes we certainly do do this, and this is kind of the basis of iterative development (if each version of a program is a different program).

30,"On your first question, you have some examples, and I have some examples, and some rock solid data and even science would be great, but I have none to give you.<p>For your first question, I have some horrendous examples, head splitting, back breaking, life threatening, totally overwhelming and convincing.<p>As I was growing up, next door neighbor:  Get married, have one child, gain 100 pounds, and watch TV for the rest of her life, only a house mouse.<p>Wife of a friend of a business associate of mine:  Man had a good business as a designer of process plants and traveled a lot.  His wife fell in love with Jack Daniels, and whenever he got home she was passed out on the floor surrounded by empties, only a house mouse.<p>Mother of cousin of a girlfriend of mine:  Get married, have one child and retire to her bedroom with several large dogs, only a house mouse.<p>Mother of another girlfriend of mine:  Have one more child, an <i>accident</i>, retire to a back room with beer and cigarettes for the rest of her life, only a house mouse.<p>Mother of a girlfriend of my brother:  Have one child and spend rest of her life working in her garden and getting a suntan, happy only as a house mouse.<p>Pure form and worst example, mother and three daughters I knew:  Hate men, marriage, motherhood, and money, be fantastic actresses and manipulators, be from excellent up to world-class brilliant at academics, get married, have minimum number of babies husband would tolerate, be just terrified to the point of clinical depression and worse from stress of <i>social phobia</i> in any job that paid above minimum wage, be desperate to devote life to <i>saving the world</i> but never do much in this direction, feel <i>stronger</i> from having <i>affairs</i>, compete with husband and try to win by sabotaging his efforts, and dump husband at first financial opportunity, for each of the four of them, only a house mouse.<p>One women in the neighborhood:  Hated everything, husband, children, home, work, car, waistline, etc. except efforts at social climbing, only a house mouse.<p>Hollywood <i>gets it</i> and commonly portrays women as so emotionally wacko that they are from helpless down to self-destructive at anything but being a house mouse.  E.g., recently on TCM, the 1953 movie <i>Mogambo</i> showed at least one of the two main women characters (I didn't watch the whole thing) helpless and even destructive outside of a house.<p>For advising young men, I wouldn't tell them that all women can be just house mice or that the average woman mostly wanted to be just a house mouse.  I would say that among women there is shockingly large range on several important criteria for a happy, productive life, and that a shockingly large fraction of women are happy only as house mice.  Also I can say that there is a significant pattern of young women looking really stable and capable from 16-20 but going to helpless mice starting at about 22.  In particular, Nervous Nellie is nearly a redundancy.  For the single most important cause of that range I would repeat some words from an expert on women, ""Of COURSE women are MUCH more emotional than men.  That is the cause of all the problems [between men and women]."".<p>I would advise young men looking for a wife:  Under no circumstances take what a young women says at face value:  She is likely a magnificent actress and manipulator and may be lying or may actually not know in any serious sense what she wants, may aspire not to be a house mouse but not be able to do anything else, or may too soon change so that she is only a house mouse.<p>I would also warn young men:  Eventually you may conclude that Mother Nature and Darwin were there long before you were and that, net, what counts with them is a woman's position on the tree and for that what counts is her success having babies as a house mouse and that all other women are likely weak, sick, or dead limbs on the tree.<p>Yes, in K-12 and college, commonly in everything except technical subjects, the girls easily knock the socks off the boys and, thus, show high <i>ability</i>:  Still don't be fooled because Mother Nature has a trump card up her sleeve -- emotions which starting at about 16 and rising to overwhelming intensity block all ability except at being a house mouse.  Some women are still able to apply their abilities; many are not, and for that Mother Nature and Darwin just smile but their husbands, unless moderately wealthy, will not.<p>There is some <i>old wisdom</i> on these points, and women themselves have changed not at all since then:  One of the points was, ""A woman's place is in the home."". Another was, ""Idle hands do devil's work."" which warns men to keep their wives BUSY. A traditional marriage vow was that she would ""obey"":  So, men, considering what you know about you and her, map out, in your own mind, what you want her to do by the week, quarter, year, and the rest of her life, break the work down into small steps, suggest such steps at appropriate times, have the steps keep her BUSY, and shower her with praise and approval (<i>emotional security</i>) when she does well.  For a more modern view, there is the remark by Dr. Carol Nadelson (yes, likely NOT a house mouse) that ""Traditional marriage is about off-spring, security, and caretaking"" from the preface of:<p>Maggie Scarf, <i>Intimate Partners:  Patterns in Love and Marriage,</i> Random House, New York, ISBN 0-394-5585-X, 1987.<p>Next, there was a reason <i>I Love Lucy</i> was so funny, around the world:  Lucy is too much like too many women.<p>Curiously, there is support in the <i>chick flicks</i> in the series <i>Legally Blond</i>:  So, in the first movie, she got a new boyfriend and promptly got him fired from a promising position in a high end Boston law firm.  In the second movie, he had started his own law firm in Boston, and she went all a-flutter at her job, quit, went to DC to <i>save the world</i>, and dragged him down there and stopped his career a second time.  The woman outside a house was a one-person, walking financial disaster area.  She wasn't a <i>mouse</i> but she was safe from her own nonsense only in a house.<p>From the same actress, in <i>Sweet Home Alabama</i>, she wrecks her marriage to actually quite a good guy, runs off to NY and is financially successful only in a way that can work in a chick flick fantasy, gets a limp wristed boyfriend, goes back to Alabama for a day or so, wrecks everything, with her husband, her family, her friends, and also her planned marriage with her NY boyfriend, and finally decides to return to her husband as a house mouse.<p>My core advice to young men:  Mother Nature and Darwin want her to be a MOMMY. Being a MOMMY plus anything else is at best as good as being a MOMMY (Mother Nature and Darwin have not yet caught on that if she will have even a $20 an hour job for a few years that will help buy a house and help her be a mommy).<p>For being a MOMMY, Mother Nature and Darwin have some chemicals, STRONG chemicals:  Some of the chemicals apply to make her a mommy if she is not; e.g., she will create disasters to create dependency to lead to pregnancy and/or get terribly unhappy and have romantic dreams, as in the Kindle ads, of a man having her ""fly away"" with him.  Or she will be like the woman in <i>Titanic</i>, whose <i>big problem</i> was really just silly and an excuse, be so eager to get pregnant she would hook up with a third class passenger and ditch her marriage to a wealthy guy.  And there are chemicals to keep her happy in a house if she is a mommy (with children under 4).<p>Don't try to compete with those chemicals.  Instead, get her pregnant and keep her that way until she has about eight of her own children and, finally, has her whole life totally devoted to just her children and her home.  If you can't afford that yet, then wait, be successful in business, and try again.  Under no circumstances expect anything stable, effective, or predictable with a wife not solidly on the <i>mommy track</i>, ""It's not nice to try to fool Mother Nature."".<p>There are some traditional, partial exceptions:  Basically, have her right there beside her husband 24 x 7, say, as a farm housewife, customer service leader in a family business, office manager for a dentist, etc.<p>For your second question, and your exception of Page and Brin, a founder, on the Board, with a LOT of stock is easily able to be an exception:  Due to their position of power, they can without threat or concern hire nearly anyone.  But I would expect that in the middle and lower ranks of Google, my rule still applies or mostly so.  At at least one major technology company, the personnel policy is up into management or out by age 35; a side effect is essentially just the rule I gave.  In the officer corps of the US military, the rule is keep getting promoted or leave, and this rule makes my rule hold.<p>For a young person considering their career, they better just accept my rule as a rock solid fact and not look for or count on exceptions.",2010-09-23 03:12:38,1718423

      Only principles endure and these I now possess..For what is success other than a state of mind?

32,"A few tips.  Not solutions, but touchpoints:<p>Assess your health.  An injury left me with a lot of nasal congestion and discomfort.  This severely limited my focus compared to prior.  Allergies, etc. can be similar.  Regarding this, I've become increasingly convinced that many psychological and psychiatric diagnoses are diagnoses of symptoms stemming from underlying physical problems.  And our (U.S., at least) fractured medical system means that the underlying causes can easily go undiagnosed especially with regard to these cognitive impacts.  (The poster child for this might be sleep apnea; at least it now finally has mainstream recognition.)<p>Environmental sensitivity.  I have an extremely difficult time tuning out surrounding activity -- particularly human activity.  Conversations, people fluttering about in my peripheral vision, etc., destroy my concentration.  Assess your workspace(s), the variations in their activity levels, and any corresponding variations in your productivity.<p>With peace and quiet, after an hour or two I could (sometimes still can) achieve what at least in the AD(H)D domain is sometimes termed ""hyperfocus"".  Once ""in the zone"", I could <i>really</i> concentrate, and I could then achieve not just more volume of work in a given amount of time, but also a depth of insight and analysis that others often just couldn't achieve.<p>If it's noisy and disruptive, though: Fergetaboutit.  Sometimes, once in the zone my focus would become so intense that surrounding disruptions would simply fade out of my awareness.  Not always, though, and it is something I could not / cannot control.<p>I should add that I do <i>not</i> have difficulty interacting with people.  Actually, most people seem to rather like working with me.  Being around them is just fine, when we actually are working together.  But when I need to do something they are not an active part of, their presence can be very distracting.<p>Medications.  Turns out, I'm rather sensitive to these (I'm just a sensitive guy, I guess; I suppose that explains my meager dating life ;-).  Many psychiatrists have no concept of this.  St John's Wort helped me some (though not necessarily for ADD symptoms; in fact, I sometimes wonder whether it makes them a tad worse for me).  Zoloft and its many siblings and cousins made me much, much worse.  More recently, I've run across some descriptions of what is called ""serotonin poisoning"" -- too much serotonin.  My symptoms on typical/standard doses of e.g. SSRI's fit this to a T; yet, despite describing these symptoms to the prescribing psychiatrist (to be clear, not just a physician), this condition was never even raised by them as a possibility.<p>Eventually, I learned of a psychologist with a psychiatrist wife, whose profile seemed rather similar to mine.  And he had found that one rather low dose of Adderall in the morning was all he needed.  I tried that -- after finally finding a psychiatrist who was willing to consider its use concurrent with St. John's Wort -- and, after finding even 5 mg too much, settled on 2.5 mg.  My difference being that I'll typically take 2 doses 6 hours apart (the effective life of many drug doses, for me).<p>I'm not saying you fit this profile.  But there are elements that may be of use in considering.  And be aware that, at least in my experience, there are a lot of ""professionals"" out there who won't have the first idea about really helping you.<p>That doesn't mean you shouldn't try.  But keep your sense of self, self-respect, and the old bullshit meter set to ""High"".<p>One final thing regarding medications.  About... 7 or 8 years ago, psychiatrists started pushing low doses of anti-psychotics for (initially, at least) off-label treatment for a broad range of other conditions, including AD(H)D.  Well, it turns out that at least one factor in that was a push by drug companies to develop new markets for these drugs.  IIRC, in particular Johnson &#38; Johnson ended up settling with one or another government agency for an amount in the many millions of dollars, for what was determined to be mis-represention and violation of regulations in this regard.<p>If someone starts trying to sell you on the idea of Risperdal or one of its many siblings and cousins, I'd consider very carefully and insist on a very detailed argument for this, before proceeding.  The lower doses are supposedly safer, but these classes of drugs are -- in my limited layman's understanding -- not something to take lightly, as it were.<p>Actually, one more thing, I guess, about medications:  For Adderall, at least, there apparently are differences between the brand drug and generics, and there are -- in my anecdotal experience -- definitely differences between the different generics.  I experienced the latter unexpectedly when my pharmacy changed suppliers in their stocking of a generic equivalent.  It was not a pleasant experience.<p>As I say, it was for me completely unexpected.  Only after having the initial experience did I google around and learn that I was not alone in it.<p>A final postscript:  Heavy, daily exercise also helped me.  Unfortunately, a bad leg injury subsequently quite severely limited this for me.  But I'd recommend it, if and as you can.",2011-01-07 04:23:33,2078554

37,"I'd like to have enough money that I can provide the sort of life my parents gave me to my kids. Even though I went to college on a near full-ride, my parents were ready to pay out of pocket for tuition if need be. Even though I worked from the time I was 15 on, my parents never required me to - school was my job. Even though I probably could have gotten into a good college with a public school education (and the schools where I lived weren't great by any stretch), my parents homeschooled me and then paid for me to go to the best school in the area when I knew more than they could teach. As I've grown older, I realize what a great advantage that was, and I'd like to give my kids the same. Even if they don't do anything with that chance, I don't ever want anyone to be able to say ""yeah, Barton - but you didn't do &#60;blank&#62; for your kids.""<p>That's my paramount goal. I have subordinate goals to that, but they're expendable given the greater good. For instance I'd like to get better at math and eventually get an M.S. in math of some sort to complement my M.S. in CS. That would open the door to what I consider more interesting work, but there's no guarantee it would be higher paying than the sort of work I do now. I'd also like to eventually run my own business doing work in scientific computing or some other highly technical arena, but that entails a degree of risk that makes it more of an endgame plan for me. I'd like to finish the marathon I was training for before I tore my PCL in 2005, but I don't have the time in my life now for the training regimen I was on (75 miles a week).

38,"All sites rank ""artificially"", since search engines are incapable of measuring quality or relevance to a searcher's intent and instead rely on proxy signals like links and similarity to keywords on a page or in a link graph.  Good SEO concentrates both on making sure that your content creation does not interact poorly with the 100%-guaranteed-to-be-artificial way that search engines perceive your website, and on strategic issues in shaping how you create and communicate value in such a way that it will actually be found by people.  For example, if you routinely create long essays with metaphorical titles, you need to be told by your SEO guy that search engines don't do metaphors well and searchers don't typically look for them, so they need to be retitled to be more fact- or benefit-oriented.  (This is a lesson that the traditional media learned, and it required absolute bloodletting in the newsrooms to get it across: ""Studio Flutters As Swan Soars"" used to be newspaper best practice, for web writing it is now ""Strong Black Swan Opening Weekend Did Not Help Studio Stock Price."")<p>More broadly, this attitude is like the reflexive engineer distrust of marketing, believing that product quality excuses all sins.  It doesn't.  If your product sounds scary to a user, and she avoids trying it because of that, you fail to create value for her.  You need to communicate that your product is not scary.

Your body needs both!<p>Now, refined SIMPLE carbs (table sugar, fruit juice, ""packaged"" cereals, chocolate bars, etc.) are not good for you, and only certain types of bodies with certain physical activity should consume them (e.g., if you are a bodybuilder or if you lift weights a few times a week, etc.). It is still absolutely tantamount that you consume unrefined simple carbs such as strawberries, raspberries, oranges, apples, plum, pear, a long etc., and the number one fruit because of its flavanoid content: blueberries!).<p>Put simply, fruits and complex carbs help you convert what you eat in slow-releasing energy that has less content that is turned into fat (as opposed to refined simple carbs). This steady release of energy is part of ""moderation is key"". If you have your body working too hard, your heart fluttering/palpitations and overworking it are not healthy, neither is when your body processes everything too slow.<p>The biggest factor when consuming carbs (both simple and complex) is the glycemic levels in your blood. You can't have this fluctuate so much, especially if you're pre-disposed to it, otherwise you throw it out of kilter and it may cause diabetes.<p>I'll keep the fat part short. We need fat, too! Let me be less ""headliney"". We need polyunsaturated fatty acids; in part, to keep our metabolism going. Foods like avocado, fish, flax seed, leafy vegetables, soybeans, walnuts (nuts), and shellfish. Sure, saturated fats may not be the major cause of heart disease, but lessening it while consuming a healthy amount of polyunsaturated fat and complex carbs might. You can read an article on that here (it's better than the OP's article, but still has its flaws): <a href=""http://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/health/rethinking-saturated-fat-its-not-your-hearts-enemy/article1462757/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/health/rethinking-satura...</a> (By the way, this article was published over a year ago.)<p>Having said all that, each body is different. You should tailor your diet to what your body reacts positively to. For example, flax seed is healthy for you, but I know people who get diarrhea from it. Obviously, don't force yourself to eat something your body doesn't like. Listen to your body, because, unfortunately, the science doesn't fully understand all body types.<p>I'm not a fan of fallacies from defective induction, so I shall refrain from an argumentum ad verecundiam on this, but on a separate note, I will say my friend studied nutrition and she has expressed a keen dislike toward the ""Food guide pyramid"".",2011-05-20 15:09:23,2567953
40,"The article misses that this is fundamentally an issue with the PHY level of ""mobile"" broadband systems.<p>If you've got a very simple radio,  say, a ham 2 meter handset,  you find there are interference patterns caused by multipath interference that cause the signal to get stronger and weaker as you move half a wavelength this way or that way.  This causes a fluttering noise when you're listening to somebody transmitting from a car.<p>A more advanced radio that uses a spread-spectrum signal finds that at any moment of time,  some parts of the signal's frequency range is in-phase and some is out-of-phase.<p>If your goal is to make a low-bandwidth signal robust,  you can spread a low-bandwidth signal over a wide spectral range and you won't notice fading.  On the other hand,  if you're trying to send as much data as you possibly can in the bandwidth you've got,  you're ultimately going to implement something like OFDM.  Now,  in an OFDM system,  you're using frequencies in parallel to transmit more data,  not to improve robustness.  If you're sitting in one place your system can figure out what the fading is and work around it.  If you're moving,  the relative performance of the subchannels is always changing too fast for OFDM to work.<p>This is how you can have a good voice connection on your phone (which is using a PHY truly built for mobile operation) but not have it on for data (which is using a PHY built for high performance operation from a fixed point.)",2011-06-27 14:34:17,2701419

49,"These posts are exceptionally well-timed for me. I'm currently wrangling with one of those problems that is just not solved well with relational databases, or even the flat document store that my company already uses. I've been looking hard at Redis and Mongo, and of late I'm leaning towards Mongo. You know what? Having read these posts and the threads - and having extracted what little in the way of factual datapoints I could from them - I'm pretty sure I'll still be riding into production with Mongo.<p>Some of you guys who were all aboard the NOSQL UBER ALLES hype train a year or two ago now seem to be swinging back - with scrapes and bruises from some truly harebrained misdeployments, no doubt - to a reactionary 'All NoSQL are doomed to reimplement everything relational' nihilism. Back to shitty OR tools and ugly-ass joins for everyone, damnit! Harumph. I could write a novel just quoting and responding to some of the stupid pronouncements and prescriptions for correctness on these Mongo threads' comments.<p>Anyways. With regards to this specific post:<p>Let's rewind a couple of years. I work for a significantly smaller company than our anon raconteur, from the sound of it. At roughly the same time as he adopted Mongo, I was also looking hard at it, to solve some problems where the relational options available to us weren't going to cut the mustard. Damn, did Mongo look cool, fun even. The flexibility of having arbitrary object graphs in it and querying down into subdocument properties with real indexing on them, well, it sets nearly any developer's heart a-flutter, particularly those of us who work on dynamic web stuff a fair bit.<p>Sadly, I have to be an engineer and pragmatist first, I have to think about much more than what is sexy and comfortable for devs. I've been through my share of 3AM wake-up world-enders, I've learned the hard lessons. I considered variables like basic maintainability by ops people, credibility of the vendor, track record, robust redundancy and availability solutions, how far up shit creek we'd be in a disaster recovery scenario, etc. And after thorough research I decided that, for my much smaller company which can afford to be judiciously bleeding-edge where it makes sense to, Mongo was just not clearing the bar. I sucked it up and used unsexy properly normalized relational database tables, then utilized memory caching and async updates to try and paper over the performance issues inherent in that scheme.<p>What was anon doing? Charging full steam ahead into the wild unknown with Mongo, on an effort that was apparently important to a userbase of millions at a ""high profile"" company. That's some mighty responsible stewardship of the company, or even just the IT department's, broader concerns right there. Now, I understand that it totally makes sense to have used Mongo 1.x as a scrappy startup on a greenfield project, no problem. But this guy was in a different situation. At that scale in a BFC, conservatism rules, and it rules for a reason.<p>I think I am starting to understand why anon is anon.<p>In any case, we're likely going to roll with Mongo soon. It is indeed maturing, and I'm a lot more comfortable with it on all of my criteria these days. I have possibly read more of the JIRA issues than some of the devs, and they are prioritizing the Right Things - at least for my tastes. By my estimation it is on the right track.<p>Even having not <i>used</i> it in production yet, I can identify some things people are complaining about here as complete and utter RTFM-fail, misunderstanding of what it is they're deploying and whether what they expect out of it is realistic before they begin.

For the universe, the span of your life <i>should</i> have been not even the fluttering of an eyelash before a blink. From a cosmic perspective, the existence of our whole galaxy was set to be one giant quantum fluctuation - the birth and death of a mere grain of matter, falling from one eon to another.<p>But then something incredible, something unexplainable, happened. Inanimate matter came forth from the deep waters. It grew legs, it started to <i>paint</i> on cave walls, not yet aware of the implications of what it was doing.

Whoever you are, however you came into existence, and no matter what your purpose is, you are capable of understanding deep philosophical arguments and complex equations. I have none of that for you, merely a saying often heard on HN or in rejection therapy groups: <i>Never say no.</i> Ask yourself what is necessary to make life worth it.

We have to. All the world's billions can't have two cars in the garage, but they can all have giant digital art and music collections.

Having having one's heart slowed to sub-40bpm via a few taps on a screen is...odd. Printed report tells assorted stories of daily activity periods, odd events, heart rate hitting programmed thresholds, etc. There have been some confluence of proximity &#38; programming causing twitching under some circumstances (couldn't sleep on my left side for a year due to a lead pressing on &#38; convulsing diaphragm) which were fixed completely thru software settings. Have a minimum threshold programmed in, and if it's set too high (say, 60bpm) and I relax deeply can feel it kicking in with ""go faster!""<p>Proved quite useful a couple weeks back. Suffered a random onset of aortic flutter (can happen to anyone, just sorta happens), where a natural short-circuit in the beat-signal nerves sent the heart rate up to 349bpm (neatly documented on the printed data dump). For most people, this means a very scary and tense race to the emergency room, with AED paddles &#38; drugs to bring it down until the problem can be surgically eliminated. My pacemaker hit the brakes at 150bpm, leaving me functional to wander in to the ER at my convenience; there, a tech was brought in to set up a more aggressive flutter-control program (70-100bpm more aware of actual physical needs). That kept things manageable until the drive-thru heart surgery to fix the problem (1 hour to send a probe up a vein to find &#38; burn out the short, 3 hours rest, then discharged). Wasn't what the pacer was installed to handle (ventricular resynchronization), but the ""while we're installing this, let's add a wire and program in some other someday-useful stuff"" has indeed proven useful.<p>Other body modification is a mechanical heart valve.

Flutter needs a redesign a bit less than Exec does, but his is an improvement nonetheless.<p>Main concerns with the current Flutter site: The video is front and center.  I get why companies do that, and it's smart to make the video and have it there.  But I almost never watch product videos until I'm already intrigued. Videos take waaaaay longer than reading, so a focus on intriguing me in a sentence or two first goes a long way to getting me to watch the video at all.<p>The second is that annoying little popup at the bottom.

My mind wants to be learning how the product works, not wondering how it cleverly relates to futurist mythology (as much as I am a fan). However, I think the Jedi themed testimonial is entirely appropriate, as it is of lower weight in the informational hierarchy and is an individual's statement, not the company's.<p>Lastly, the ""Yes, master"" blurb is not appropriate as official marketing copy, even if it is intended as an ironic reference to the Jedi master-apprentice relationship. It is too easy to mistake it for a reference to a master-slave relationship, which is not a good association in any respect. It's just not an issue you want to draw association with even in the slightest most oblique way. The lesson here is that all copy must be screened for any kind of irrelevant connotation.<p>I do like the direction in which you're going with the copy in the left hand column below the main section. That's starting to develop a fun, snappy voice, and the fish graphic is pleasantly quirky.<p>Lastly, to maximize the ""throughput of information"" about the product that one gets by just looking at the page ""above the fold"", I would make the main graphic more explanatory (possibly with little blurbs like you used for ""yes, master"").

We came up with a simple gesture to play/pause a song (itunes/spotify) by asking thousands of humans what gesture they would use if they did not have mouse/keyboard/voice.  Almost everyone came up with the one we picked...  even for next set of gesture, we're looking at static human gestures that are micro and intuitive (and doesn't make you fatigued).<p>When we released the first app, we got countless emails asking for hand-swipe as a next song gesture.  We had felt a long ago that even though it seems natural it is completely impractical in certain context (i.e. coffee shop) and doing hand swipe 20 times starts to wear you down.

138,"By broad point was not really clear, but could simply be stated as:<p>We will make a lot of assumptions about what is a linear expense, linear threat etc. without really knowing what will be linear until we pack an extremely tight grouping of cars on the road.<p>Taking my point further:<p>For road work, expense may go from linear to nonlinear because of something that seems completely counterintuitive.  Imagine every car now has variation in the exact placement within the lanes.  Highways have marks where the majority of cars drive, but variation in drivers accounts for variation in path.  If every robot executed their driving in the exact 1 foot per tire space, it is likely that 1 foot per tire space would require a greater than linear road work.  This could be solved by programing an automatic variation in all cars or possibly changing how roads are built so that they require only cement in those 1 foot areas.<p>Now, an example of a time when engineers thought they had it right, but didnt think of everything:<p>Engineering has come a long way since the Tacoma bridge incedent, but we cannot underestimate what assumptions were previously made that will be incorrect when we start driving far more vehicles on roads.  In the Tacoma bridge edge case, sustained winds caused flutter (self-feeding vibration) which caused the bridge to fail.<p>While I do not suggest this is a likely case, the fact is, we are probably not considering everything and there will be issues we do not foresee, but we should try to eliminate as many edge cases as possible.<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zczJXSxnw"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zczJXSxnw</a>

In a situation where a truck on the highway has a blowout which causes large debris to separate from the truck, the robots still need some room to slow down.  In the extreme example where cars are 1 foot away from each other, an accident like that would have tremendous negative consequences that even robots would have a tough time dealing with.<p>We will have self-driving cars, and they will likely be much safer than human operated cars, but we are going to also have setbacks and many of them can be avoided by looking to the future and trying to solve the problems early rather than later.",2012-09-04 21:15:26,4476577

One could use the gesture pendant to open blinds, turn on/off the tv, answer the phone, etc.  If you're partially blind, it's probably hard to locate the tv remote to turn on the tv, but when you're wearing the pendant, you can do it anywhere.  If you're elderly, it may be difficult to open the blinds.  The pendant was interesting, but requires special hardware.

But I actually find the overall layout of the upper half to be more intuitive than Exec's actual design.<p>Not a fan of the Flutter redesign. The actual Flutter page is really cool and unique, even if at the expense of readability. The redesign looks like every other startup/app landing page.<p>Ditto for the Pebble redesign.

A lot better use of limited space, and the foldout detail panel is definitely something Instcart should have. Instacart's current design of having a rotating bar of categories is really unintuitive and pretty bad design IMO.<p>I think having other people redesign your website/app is actually a great thing, because it's a way of getting different perspectives.

All night the conversation fluttered around nappies and toddler-proofing houses and more stuff about dealing with baby poo and vomit and whatnot.<p>On the one hand, it's fine, because these are new sets of parents using a pressure release valve, but on the other hand, it's screamingly boring because I've had to deal with the exact same conversation with new parents throughout my life.

176,"Having a pacemaker, I've been quietly paranoid about <i>any</i> magnets coming anywhere close to it. That includes keeping the iPad away from the area, both because of magnets and the radio transmitter.<p>One of the first warnings I got about having one was to not dangle earbuds around my neck where they would hang in front of my left shoulder. Other warnings about keeping distance from generators, magnets, shoulder-pressed cell phones, store theft-deterrent sensors, and even chainsaws (cardiologist &#38; I got a kick out of wondering which would kill me first: the alternator's fields knocking out the pacer, or my passed-out fall into the still-spinning blade). MRIs...just don't even go there.<p>The problem with magnets is more complex than perhaps obvious. There's bad input, and then there's damage. What the girl is referring to is quite legitimate: defibrillators and pacemakers typically allow proximity of a magnet as a ""master override"" function. When I suffered an unrelated instance of atrial flutter (heart decided to run at 350bpm, pacemaker hit the brakes at 150...for 12 hours), the ER doc not having a diagnostic system handy forced the pacemaker to reduce to a much more humane rate by placing a good-sized magnet over the pacemaker; this allowed a more relaxed 2-hour wait for a technician to arrive and better diagnose &#38; manage the problem (the subsequent drive-thru heart surgery is another story). She's raising awareness that sometimes this ""master override"" function can be induced improperly and even unknowingly, leaving the patient in a high-risk condition without knowing until periodic diagnostics or medical failure. A related issue she may tangentially raise awareness of is outright damage, with induced currents overstimulating the patient or frying the electronics (see aforementioned chainsaw issue).<p>She's raising a good issue. With the proliferation of tiny super-magnets, an enduring technical problem must be revisited: how to provide a low/no-impact way to essentially ""hit the reset button"" on an implanted medical device when there is no visible/external contacts? Not long ago, using a strong magnet to activate a magnetic switch was a sensible solution. Today, stronger magnetic fields are coming closer more often, risking activating a ""safe/master mode"", and there's not much way to alert anyone to the condition.<p>To address a few other points: Yes, any small but strong magnets like the magsafe plug are a possible problem. It's not an EMI problem so much as false input to a magnetic sensor. Defibrillators and pacemakers face the same basic problem, but the former moreso because the ""master override"" function needed is a function shutdown (need a way to turn it off and keep it off), while the latter responds in a more benign manner.<p>Glad to hear someone raising awareness of the issue. Amused that it's a child figuring it out and publicizing it. Thanks, kid!",2013-05-09 21:07:48,5682951
177,"I&#x27;ve written CSS for years and only recently started implementing some animations in my designs. I was worried at first when browsers started implementing it, fearing useless and insipid animations would sprawl around the web (like some jQuery ones). But like anything, if used sparingly, animations can improve an interface. Apart from adding life and being &quot;cool&quot; (probably the reason why designers implement them in the first place), animations add interactivity and affordance. Plus, they&#x27;re less prone to bugs because the code is easier to read and write than jQuery alternatives, and the browsers&#x27; rendering engine usually prevents unwanted fluttering and infinite loops from happening.",2013-06-14 12:28:17,5879493

Recently I spent a few weeks experimenting with e-cigs to see if I could get the nicotine high that I remember enjoying without my body feeling like crap.  No dice. Puffing on nice-tasting, pleasant smelling nicotine vapor still made my body feel like crap at times, just like it did when I smoked analog cigarettes.  I didn&#x27;t feel it in my lungs so much, but I did feel like my blood pressure was elevated and my heart was a bit fluttery, and once it gave me a rather bad headache.

182,"I&#x27;m getting a lot of replies that are confused as to just what a conspiracy theory is, so I thought it would be worth following up to elaborate on that.<p>People seem to think that a conspiracy theory is about <i>what</i> is being theorized. The moon landing was faked. 9&#x2F;11 was an inside job. The NSA is recording every American phone call.<p>But that&#x27;s not it at all. It&#x27;s not about <i>what</i> you theorize, it&#x27;s about <i>how</i>. A sane and considered theory that leads to a crazy-seeming conclusion is not a conspiracy. Similarly, an insane theory that leads to a correct conclusion is still a conspiracy theory.<p>Some examples. Saying that the moon landing was faked because the flag was &quot;fluttering&quot; and there are no stars in the photographs is a conspiracy theory. Saying that the moon landing may have been faked because, say, you managed to get ahold of a secret memo from JFK discussing the possibility of faking it, would not be a conspiracy theory.<p>Similarly, saying that the NSA is spying on everybody because of the testimony and documentation provided by a whistleblower is not a conspiracy theory. However, saying that the NSA is spying on everybody because all the numbers in your e-mail header add up to 666 is a conspiracy theory.<p>What it comes down to is how you interpret the evidence. If you interpret it sanely, then it&#x27;s not a conspiracy theory. If you twist mundane things to build narratives that are not justified by the evidence, then it&#x27;s a conspiracy theory.<p>That is what&#x27;s happening with this story. Is it possible that this person was assassinated by the US government? Sure. Is that theory supported by the evidence discussed by this article and other similar articles posted to HN over the past few weeks? Not even a little bit. And <i>that</i>, not the supposed outlandishness of the conclusion, is what makes this a &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; that is not worth paying attention to and frankly not worth making it to the front page of HN.<p>If an article on this matter shows up that <i>sanely</i> analyzes the evidence and comes up with the conclusion that it was probably an assassination, I&#x27;d love to see it on the front page.

194,"Hey HN! I&#x27;m the creator and co-founder of this project. I&#x27;ve been designing robots since I was 15 and hacking on electronics since I could hold a screwdriver. What I think you&#x27;ll like most about this project is the open source long range encrypted wireless link our mesh provides. I discovered Hacker News about a year ago and have been a regular reader since, so I remember Cryptocat, the NSA, and all the other things that reminded us why cryptography is important, and why implementing it is critical.<p>So, a few answers:<p>Yes, you can do encrypted mesh networks over long range. I&#x27;m a hardcore robotics guy at heart - the name &quot;Flutter&quot; was chosen exactly because this protocol is designed to be as lightweight as possible, and though the mesh protocol itself is still being developed (basically, that&#x27;s why we need kickstarter, aside from the fact that I&#x27;m tired of ramen), I really intend for the protocol to stay out of the way. You&#x27;ll also have full control over what happens, so you can always turn meshing off and use hard addressing. It&#x27;s still really simple to use that way and cheaper than everything else I&#x27;ve seen that compares.<p>I absolutely will not sell a product as &quot;cryptographically secure&quot; unless I believe it is, and I understand that the &quot;smallest&quot; flaw in a cryptographic system can render the entire system worthless. I am learning everything I can about cryptography, starting with some amazing e-books I have found on the subject, and just like wireless<p>Our data rate is proportional to our range (this is generally true for any radio system), so we get 1km range at low data rates (1200baud tested, but we physically ran out of test room and had a strong signal). Theoretically this radio can do 3km at 1200 baud and it looks like we should be able to do 1km at 30kbps at least. Also I think the new radio chip doubles all the data rates in these cases (I would have to confirm), and I do know the new chip has higher transmit power and higher sensitivity, so range should be even better.<p>There is a cheap radio amplifier (PA and LNA) called the CC1190, and texas instruments has all kinds of datasheets on using either of the two radios we are working with to give us 10km range, or much better data rates at 1km, etc. We&#x27;re going to design the protocol with expansion in that direction in mind, if people really dig the range thing (it&#x27;s a bit much for a beer brew setup, but if you want dark meshnets, lets do it!)<p>I&#x27;m a hacker at heart. I first learned lockpicking at the old Noisebridge location (the original one). I love 3D printers and open source, did a rant&#x2F;thread about open hardware on the Ultimaker mailing list a year back (I was one of the first in the bay area to get an Ultimaker too, and designed a new mount for it that I have on thingiverse). I got on hackaday for some 3d printed helicopter blades, and have been building robots since I was 15. There&#x27;s a longer bio about me on our site, at flutterwireless.com<p>See also me ten years ago talking about robots (and I feel silly for the &quot;few people do&quot; comment, but I was 15 and trying to keep it simple).

196,"We are definitely designing these to support mesh networks, and though I haven&#x27;t written it down anywhere yet, we&#x27;re not going to default the radios to full on, that will either be automatically configured (probably too difficult, but I&#x27;ll look into it) or just manually specified. I would really love to make it automatic though, and for anything under constant comms they could easily communicate their signal strength in the ack if needed to coordinate that. The mesh protocols are still under development (that&#x27;s what we need Kickstarter for!).<p>Our wifi + ethernet shield makes it easy to have an always on device that routes traffic for home Flutter networks, but you can also just plug the board into your PC over USB and feed it traffic that way, you can run arbitrary data of any size over the link and all communications are guaranteed (or explicitly timeout), so I think piping TCP&#x2F;IP over it will be easy.<p>You can also use a raspberry pi and one of our boards to accomplish what the network shield does (for roughly the same price) but the network shield is designed for exactly this purpose, and many people will find value in that.<p>It&#x27;s tough to pitch an Arduino with lots of highly technical capabilities - Arduino users just want to know &quot;but can i make a wireless beer brew setup?&quot; That&#x27;s the kind of information we try to speak to on the KS page.

198,"I can&#x27;t speak for the creators of Flutter, but I can definitely attest to that TCP&#x2F;IP with full mesh routing should be doable with the Flutter hardware. We (Thingsquare) have the CC1101 as one of our supported hardware platforms and use it to run full TCP&#x2F;IPv6 networking over a self-forming mesh. The system is used in a number of commercial products and systems. The chip-level firmware is open source so I guess the creators or backers of the Flutter system might even be able use it pretty much out of the box: <a href=""http://thingsquare.com/tech/"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;thingsquare.com&#x2F;tech&#x2F;</a><p>One of the things needed to get full IP routing working is to do channel switching over the sub-GHz connection. Both the FCC and ETSI regulations let you transmit at a higher power and with longer bursts if you switch channels with a regular interval and if you back off if you find other transmissions in your channel.<p>That said, TCP&#x2F;IP routing over a sub-GHz CC1101 link isn&#x27;t going to be very fast. It is suitable for automated devices but not a general purpose replacement for WiFi connectivity. For IEEE 802.15.4g-compliance, the raw bit rate is 50 kbit&#x2F;s which isn&#x27;t a lot. The CC1101 can be run in faster, non-802.15.4g compliant, modes though.",2013-08-27 21:39:58,6286479

You think refining these tools is not important?<p>You give an example:<p>&gt; If I was to shuffle a pack of fifty-two playing cards and hand them to you, then asked you to sort them, youd do what any sensible person on the planet would do. Youd sort them into suit order first, then into value order.<p>The point of computational thinking is that you can concretely analyze <i>how good</i> this method is and compare it with others (I&#x27;m sure you know the tradeoffs involved in sorting!). Of course everyone knows how to naturally decompose things, but reasoning about it and handling adversarial cases, that&#x27;s where computational thinking comes in.<p>Computational thinking (forget the Popular Title, just the idea of applying computational ideas elsewhere in life) is <i>extremely valuable</i>, and I&#x27;ll give you two prominent examples: the first in the design of fair markets, which has revolutionized more than one industry [1], and the design of new computers, such as quantum computers and DNA computing [2]. I can continue: computational thinking is applied in designing fun games (not just in programming them!), art and product design, literally every optimization problem in every industry, cognitive psychology, the study of evolution, political analysis, information and security, and so on.

240,"&gt; FWIW the words pull and push are used in sailing training to emphasize the importance of keeping the leeward flow attached when going to weather.<p>Ding ding ding! Sailing is a practical matter, for nearly all sailors. It&#x27;s nearly a folk activity. The models that are used to transmit and retain that information have more to do with achieving results than with achieving <i>theoretical understanding</i>. The trouble only really comes in when we try to use these pragmatic models as scientific models!<p>&gt; Assuming the flow is attached on the leeward side, does that side also turn flow and generate force?<p>Notionally, yes. To be theoretical, attached flow on the leeward side is going to exert <i>less pressure</i> than detached flow would, due to irreversibilities in the detached turbulent flow. To be even stricter, because the equations of subsonic flow are elliptical and not hyperbolic, a mess of detached flow on the leeward side is going to jam up the whole works, even upstream and to windward.<p>The difficulty comes in when we try to mentally divide the flow between the windward and leeward sides of the sail. (Additional difficulty comes in because the &quot;adverse pressure gradient&quot; is essential to understanding this, but is tricky enough that it would probably do more harm than good to talk about it to sailing students. The first rule of Sailing Club is that you do not talk about the adverse pressure gradient. The second rule of....)<p>In practice, &quot;[k]eeping the leeward flow attached&quot; really amounts to &quot;not stalling the sail.&quot; This is probably more important when sailing to windward because you&#x27;re running as close to a stall as you can (at as high an angle of attack as you can) in order to point as high as you can. Also, with the sheets reefed in and with the higher apparent wind, the sail is more likely to be distorted. This can result in one part of the sail being stalled. Once one part stalls, the increased pressure in that area is likely to inject turbulent flow into neighboring areas that might otherwise not be stalled.<p>Another thing to consider is that there&#x27;s something filling in that area of detached flow. Guess where it comes from? The windward side of the sail via the trailing edge. While the flow has to come off the leech in the direction of the leech, nature is a bit lest strict about what it does right after; It can get turned completely around, in short order, to fill that void behind the sail. The only thing it requires is that its turning radius not be unreasonably small. Congratulations! You&#x27;ve just (1) injected higher-pressure air into the lee, and equivalently (2) stopped turning the flow on the windward side. Because of (2), you can bet that there&#x27;s an equivalent drop in pressure on the windward side as well.<p>That was the pragmatic way of understanding things. Now, I&#x27;m going to break the first rule of Sailing Club. When a flow is adjacent to a surface, the flow stops at the surface. That is, a 10 knot breeze blowing over your sail comes to a halt <i>at the part of the breeze that contacts the sail</i>. Because the adjacent flow hasn&#x27;t touched the surface, it tries to maintain its 10 knots. However, nature is sticky. Any time there are adjacent regions of flow traveling at different velocities--any time there is a <i>velocity gradient</i>--viscosity tries to average things out: The flow right next to the sail is nearly stopped; The bit next to that is traveling a bit faster; And so on. (Incidentally, on a larger scale, this is why the wind is stronger aloft than on the deck. You&#x27;re in the boundary layer, as it&#x27;s called.) All of this viscous transfer is <i>doing work on the flow</i>. Doing work raises pressure. Because this happens <i>as the flow moves downstream</i>, more work is done on the flow the farther you get from the luff, and the higher the pressure gets. I don&#x27;t think I need to convince you that fluids like to go away from high pressure to lower pressure. That is, fluids like to follow <i>pressure gradients</i>. And <i>adverse pressure gradient</i> can stop, and even reverse a flow. Note that this is likely to happen at the surface in question. Typically, the flow on the windward side has a stronger favorable pressure gradient to start with, and so can tolerate the adverse contributions of the viscous boundary layer without becoming detached. Because the point of a sail is to have lower pressure on the leeward side, there&#x27;s less <i>total pressure</i> available to start with to overcome the adverse pressure gradient, and the flow can become detached on the back side of the sail.<p>This detached condition is called, in aeronautical terms, a &quot;stall&quot;.<p>Just sheet in until the telltales flutter, and then back off until they don&#x27;t. If that doesn&#x27;t work, play with the vang until it does. ;)",2014-10-09 01:13:34,8430316

249,"What do you mean? The close-up shot at 2:52s is under vacuum. The &quot;fluttering&quot; you see is the elastic wave in the feather caused by the sudden drop in internal tension. The feather is an elastic object (to a first approximation). When the feather is hung, there&#x27;s internal tension keeping it stationary and giving its shape. When the feather is unhooked, this internal tension doesn&#x27;t just disappear instantaneously, rather an elastic wave travels through the feather at the speed of sound in the feather. Because the feather is not a perfect elastic medium, the effect you see is a damped harmonic oscillator, but it takes non-zero finite time to dampen sufficiently.<p>This is true for the big ball too, except that the speed of sound is orders of magnitude faster in it, and the spring constant of the material (steel?) is also many order of magnitude larger than the spring constant of the feather.<p>The center of mass of both objects falls at the same rate.

It&#x27;s not exactly a simple harmonic oscillator because the mass is distributed throughout, and the effective mass is <i>NOT</i> the mass of the spring (in fact it&#x27;s one third of that), but it&#x27;s relatively easy to show it moves like one (to the first degree for small displacements), albeit not in a Hacker News discussion. It will move according to<p><pre><code>    D[x] + 2D[x] + x = 0
</code></pre>
where =c&#x2F;2(mk) is the damping ratio, =(k&#x2F;m) is the undamped angular frequency and m is the effective mass. For a feather, it might well be that the oscillator is overdamped, of course. The ball most certainly has a much larger Q factor than the feather.<p>Elasticity and sound waves are very closely related. Sound is a particular kind of wave traveling through an elastic medium. For an approximately linear object, we only have longitudinal waves that move with c=(Y&#x2F;). Y is Young&#x27;s modulus and  is the density. You can immediately see that small values of Y give rise to small values of c.<p>For ideal springs of length X and cross-section S we can prove that (exercise left to the reader) that:<p><pre><code>    Y = Xk&#x2F;S
</code></pre>
so<p><pre><code>    kx&#x2F;S = Y x&#x2F;X =&gt; F&#x2F;S = Y x&#x2F;X =&gt; Y = FX&#x2F;Sx

I can estimate X=0.2m and S=1E-5 (maybe larger than you expected because we need to consider the <i>whole</i> feather as the spring, not just its stem (wrong term?). Under it&#x27;s own weight the feather seems to move approximately x=1E-2m so X&#x2F;x=20, F is of course half the weight. It&#x27;s hard to get good estimates on the internet for the weight of a feather. The most reliable estimates seem to be 8.2E-6kg for a chicken feather. Chicken feathers are small, let&#x27;s say 5E-2m so our feathers have a mass of 8.2E-6kg(X&#x2F;5E-2m)^3=0.5E-3kg. Half a gram for the giant feather. Doesn&#x27;t sound implausible.<p>Plugging all values in we get Y=5248Pa. Speed of sound is c=(Y&#x2F;)=c=(Y&#x2F;(M&#x2F;V))=(YSX&#x2F;M)=4.58m&#x2F;s, a very low value indeed and quite consistent with the slow motion video.<p>Just for kicks, the speed of sound in rubber 60m&#x2F;s. It shouldn&#x27;t surprise us at all that the speed in feathers is smaller than for rubber. Feathers are much weaker springs than usual rubber springs. (Note that if we had a spring made of rubber coils, the speed of sound in the spring would also be much smaller than the speed of sound in a rubber rod).<p>The approximations made above are all pretty wild, but the point I was trying to make is that waves travel quite slow in weak springs. The exact values don&#x27;t matter. Just get yourself a long spring made of plastic or thin metal wire and create some waves.

257,"Certainly true, in fact it&#x27;s kind of my point. Take a look at the &quot;key sentence&quot; from Harold Perkins&#x27; review of <i>From Airline Reservations to Sonic the Hedgehog</i>:<p>&quot;<i>The computer and its software nervous system brought a revolution in human development as significant as the steam engine, the automobile or the aeroplane, and even more effective in shrinking the planet</i>&quot;<p>What would you get from a history of recent revolutions in human development from someone who doesn&#x27;t know why steam-powered airplanes never really caught on? It doesn&#x27;t matter what kind of geo-political story they can put together; the idea just doesn&#x27;t work.<p>A Margaret Gowing told C-K about his history of EDSAC, &quot;What you have written
is clearly very good. I know practically nothing about computers, but I can tell that what you have written is good history, so far as it goes. However, let me urge you to look beyond programming technology to consider the kinds of people who were using computers and the problems that they were solving.&quot; Which is excellent advice, certainly, but part of what he comes up with years later, in his embarrassment over not following the advice the first time, is, &quot;Jim Wilkinson investigated errors and stability in digital numerical methods and developed advanced matrix programs. These were to prove vital in understanding and preventing flutter for the British aircraft industry, which was still reeling from the de Havilland Comet air disaster of 1954,&quot; which makes me suspect he knows about as much about numerical methods as I do.",2014-12-25 23:55:52,8797549

  But still he fluttered pulses when he said,
  &quot;Good-morning,&quot; and he glittered when he walked.
  
  And he was rich  yes, richer than a king 
  And admirably schooled in every grace:

267,"PIT OF DESPAIR, Birmingham, Tuesday (UNN)  A South Somerset Atrocity Terrier named Soberhill Black Medik Markenbrow Beatrice Vraibleu has beaten 25,000 canine rivals to win Best of Show at this year&#x27;s Crufts in Birmingham.<p>The event, held in the Gladiator Pit at Birmingham&#x27;s National Exhibition Centre, attracted more than 143,000 freak-show ghouls and failed concentration camp doctors.<p>Soberhill Black Medik Markenbrow Beatrice Vraibleu is owned by top breeder Diana Mosley-Mengele, 48, of Gloucestershire. &quot;It is unbelievable. This dog has done so well. It is the greatest accolade you could wish for. We may have to think about retiring him now because there is nothing left for him to do. Of course, we can&#x27;t breed from him, because the genitalia have been entirely bred out of the line in order to allow the extra legs to grow in.&quot;<p>Second place went to a one-year-old pit bull terrier called Thatcher, who, in a virtuoso display of the breed&#x27;s skills, ate one of the judges.<p>Dog breeding in the UK is concerned with every detail of a dog&#x27;s appearance. &quot;The perpetual haemophiliac bleeding from the snout must trickle along approved lines,&quot; said Miss Mosley-Mengele. &quot;In addition, the lifelong whimperings of pain must be pitched between 3000 and 5000 Hertz. I had to drown four bags of culls on this point in the last month alone.&quot;<p>Other events in the Arena yesterday included the Flyball Team semi finals and finals, the Agility International Invitational and a parade of Obedience winners.

This year&#x27;s event has been overshadowed by accusations that the show is cruel, with animal charities and the International Criminal Court in the Hague expressing their concerns.

Same thing.  Business mistakes?   bankruptcy is the worst case.   Sure, it&#x27;s not that weird for even smallish businesses to sign leases that are worth truly intimidating amounts of money.   My own company&#x27;s co-lo contract would cover a very high-end Ferrari.   Leases are debt.  But they can be discharged through bankruptcy.  Tax mistakes?   Tax mistakes are for life (or, as you say, until you pay them off, along with penalties and interest.)<p>I mean, I&#x27;m not saying that I&#x27;d never take such a loan, just that it is money at what I consider completely brutal terms, and for me, at least, it would be a last resort.<p>As an aside, I think that only taking loans that can be cleared by bankruptcy is something of a sanity check.   Nobody, right now, would loan me the money to buy a Ferrari, because I can&#x27;t afford a Ferrari (well, not a new one, anyhow.)  and this fact is obvious if you look at my finances, as a bank would before loaning someone that kind of money for a car.  I mean, I probably could usually make the payments, but one financial misstep on my part, or some slight flutter in my income stream and I&#x27;d be in bankruptcy territory.<p>Now, on the other hand, if that loan couldn&#x27;t be cleared by bankruptcy?  I think it would be a reasonable risk for most banks to loan me the cash for the Ferrari.   I mean I&#x27;d be eating ramen, but I could make payments as long as nothing went wrong, and even if I screw it up and they&#x27;ve gotta repo the thing, It&#x27;s pretty likely that my lifetime earnings, which they&#x27;ll get to garnish in this hypothetical world where car loans operate like student loans, are going to be enough to more than cover the loan plus interest and penalties.<p>The point being that operating without bankruptcy really moves the bar on how much effort the bank puts into figuring out if you can afford something.",2015-05-25 02:30:09,9598383

I wonder if it&#x27;s closely related to the feeling of disgust; somehow an evolved response to keep us away from rotten food perhaps? Things like bacteria growing on bread, or beehives.  Or any food that&#x27;s started decomposing.<p>There&#x27;s a cool documentary I remember seeing called &quot;How Art Made The World&quot;.  One of the things it talks about is how we&#x27;re driven to make more-than-perfect representations of things in our art.  Say we find something in the real world aesthetically pleasing.  With art, we can take that aesthetically pleasing stimulus and exaggerate it, resulting in the art being more pleasing than anything in the real world.<p>I wonder if that&#x27;s what happens here, with the almost-organic images somehow being &#x27;hyper-disgusting&#x27; as they coincidentally line up with a hyper-exaggerated version of a stimulus that on the scale of disgusting might be &#x27;slightly unappealing&#x27; in the form that we&#x27;d encounter it in the real world.",2015-06-19 02:01:47,9742674

So there might be modes where structural components have harmonics that are pretty high (several hundred to over 1000 Hz). Therefore you must use a transducer that has a frequency response that can cover that range, and sample the output of the transducer at least twice that rate (at an absolute theoretical minimum, but rule of thumb is 5x oversampling).",2015-06-30 22:31:44,9808834

Then scan for RF, correlate network activity with RF bursts, triangulate.<p>And now I&#x27;m thinking about how you might be able to defeat triangulation... Maybe a cluster of radios, some public key crypto... decentralized frequency modulation? I wonder if you could do some tricky stuff with frequency modulation if you know precise distances between the transmitters and receiver, and account for variable weather conditions, etc.<p>Somehow build a cloud of radio waves that evenly covers an area within a given radius, and the receiver knows how to decode data which was sent by the real transmitter.<p>And each transmitter is continuously sending random data, so it&#x27;s impossible to determine if one of the transmitters is a decoy, or the real one.<p>No, I don&#x27;t think this would work. I&#x27;m sure it would be easy to triangulate each individual transmitter, and then just capture all positions at once.<p>I love thinking about this stuff, though. What other ideas are there? Maybe if you owned the Starbucks itself, then you could do some tricky stuff with NAT to try and confuse the agents.<p>EDIT:  Another idea: What if you use a quadcopter as a relay between different radio frequencies, and make it fly around in random patterns... You could have a buffer of packets that empties at random intervals, so you couldn&#x27;t link the radio bursts together.<p>I just got my Flutter board [1] a few weeks ago, might be a fun experiment.<p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kickstarter.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;flutterwireless&#x2F;flutter-20-wireless-arduino-with-half-mile-1km-ran"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kickstarter.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;flutterwireless&#x2F;flutter...</a>",2015-07-01 18:44:52,9814209

313,"&quot;It&#x27;s strange how much it looks like web development&quot; - It looks a bit like a browser for native app development. To me it looks like it could be the solution to a lot of problems. What is good about the web for applications is that it is write once run everywhere (because people do not expect a native look and feel) and also that it is zero install. What is bad about the web for applications it is that it is designed for content presentation and not applications. For mobile it has a number of things that limit it for performance. To get something to even approach decent performance I have to try to understand a complex and opaque machine called the browser. Compared to native app development this is a lot more difficult. The machine is working against me because its primary concern is document layout.<p>So it looks to me like a browser for applications in resource constrained environments (mobile). I see nothing wrong with this; We used to have innovations like this all the time but since the browser came along its been a bit of a tyranny of orthodoxy. Why not have a browser for documents and a browser for applications? I certainly don&#x27;t like web apps in my browser for content sites. (They don&#x27;t work at all, or the scrolling is all over the place or they burn up my battery).<p>For the moment though they seem to be clear that flutter is for application development on android and ios only and won&#x27;t run everywhere.

319,"I get the feeling that Android Studio is a ship on the seas of Google with a helmsman of sorts but with a flotilla of smaller boats around that vie for attention.<p>The new features they introduce look interesting-ish but there are big problems, and I suspect that bundling Flutter into Android Studio, whilst a good headline, would not be high in the list of priorities.<p>For example, the C++ NDK is still not properly supported in Android Studio, despite the message that Eclipse is being deprecated at the end of next month. I have ran into numerous issues with it which has meant I have to currently abandon hope of porting this C++ library across to it.<p>Issues I have ran into:<p>a. I can either run the emulator with resume support and no GPU acceleration so that it is dog-slow to use, or have GPU acceleration and the very slow startup of the emulator.<p>b. On my Mac, it will randomly not install or find the device with adb (oddly intermittent!).<p>c. The emulator does not support WiFi, meaning monitoring apps that rely on wireless and multicast and the wireless interface being there are impossible to debug (the app makes checks for the wireless interface being available and uses its address to join an interface lower in C++ land). What&#x27;s the point of the emulator, I hear you ask?<p>d. You have to jump through Gradle hoops to stop the ndk-build system generating its own build script and to get it to respect your existing Android.mk and Application.mk files. Getting it to build static libs involves bulding shared libs and then adding another build command to include that static lib into your dummy shared lib. Static libs that you build in a build process will not be automatically copied to the APK library - only shared ones will.<p>e. My application is having problems with OpenGL textures early on but breakpoints for NDK C++ apps will NOT be hit until 10 seconds after program startup...... this is really rubbish; I can&#x27;t stress how unfathomably lame this is.<p>f. Android Device Monitor (DDMS) does not support networking monitoring for Intel images (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;code.google.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;android&#x2F;issues&#x2F;detail?id=25997"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;code.google.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;android&#x2F;issues&#x2F;detail?id=25997</a>) so you can either have a fast Intel emulator with no network monitoring support, or you can use the dog-slow ARM software emulator with network monitoring support, with the caveats that the wireless interface you depend on will be missing from the emulator, and that your breakpoints during program setup will not be hit etc. etc. etc.<p>g. Android Studio randomly stops accepting keyboard input.

357,"The article&#x27;s explanation is a bit simplified.  It sounds like his explanation is more akin to a body freedom flutter response where the aircraft&#x27;s short-period mode is coupled to the structural response.  What he observed is probably closer to a more classical flutter response with the wing&#x27;s bending and torsion coupled.  A gust hits the wing, which increases the load, this increases the bending deformation which can also induce torsion causing a twist in the wing.  At too high of a speed (the flutter speed), the response is unstable and can quickly become catastrophic.  At normal speeds, the oscillation will tend to die out as the restoring force of the structure and the damping from the structure, aerodynamic loads and controls causes the response to die out.  Interestingly, you can go past the first flutter speed of an aircraft with a properly designed control system (aeroservoelasticity) meaning you can get away with a lighter (read, more flexible) wing structure.",2015-11-15 16:56:17,10570139
358,"If a wing is too stiff, you get one kind of flutter, too soft, and you get another. The idea is to be midway between those two cases. Flutter (dynamic instability) will rip the wings off.

This error happens a few times per month.<p>- Songs not playing and getting an alert error with some random code that results in searching countless threads online. This happens multiple times per day.<p>- There&#x27;s no way to get to an artist from a song...think about that. You can&#x27;t click on the artists name or select it from the dropdown menu while a song is playing...So you have to search the song and then select the artists name in the search results.<p>- Absolutely no concept of syncing. Create a playlist on your computer and it might show up on your phone? Create one on your phone and edit it on your computer, but the changes don&#x27;t reflect across devices.

360,"Dart&#x27;s html library used to make all methods that cause layout, be asynchronous. Instead of Element.offsetHeight, you had Element.offset which returned a Future&lt;Rect&gt; (Promise in JS). Code ended up looking like:<p><pre><code>    fooify(element) {
      element.offset().then((rect) {
        &#x2F;&#x2F; do stuff
        otherelement.offset().then((rect) {

Understandably, developers didn&#x27;t like it, and unfortunately it was removed. This was before Futures and Streams had been made completely ubiquitous in Dart, and before async&#x2F;await. Now the code would look like:<p><pre><code>    fooify(element) async {
      var h = await element.offsetHeight;

389,"Hey, great question, though I&#x27;m not sure if you want the audio or neurological explanation, or both :)<p>I&#x27;m also not sure how technical you want or how much you know already, so apologies if I&#x27;m too technical, and apologies if I&#x27;m not technical enough. I&#x27;ll just try to start from the beginning and lay everything out from there, as briefly as I can. Tragically, however, I was born without brevity.<p>1) Brain.fm: The Brain&#x27;s Perspective<p>When a sound enters your ear, it&#x27;s converted from a pressure wave to an electrical impulse, which you can measure in the brain as a kind of spike on an EEG, or a cortical response. If the sound plays again, another spike occurs (although typically smaller). If a sound keeps being repeated in a fast and precise enough way, the cortical responses start to resemble rhythms already in the brain.<p>For example, if you tap your finger rapidly on the table, you might be tapping at 10hz (10 taps a second). 10hz is also a very dominant in the brain. If you could tap your finger precisely enough, and for a long enough time, what you would see in the brain (if you know what you&#x27;re doing) is new activity at 10hz. This is called the Frequency Following Response, and it&#x27;s well established. Check it out on pubmed, etc, if you&#x27;re interested.<p>Now if you keep tapping for even longer - and again, if you&#x27;re super precise about it - your existing brainwave patterns near that same frequency will start to align themselves towards the phase and frequency of your tapping.<p>BTW sorry about the delay in responding to you. Believe it or not, in between some meetings I was searching for a good article this whole time to show you. Here it is: <a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pnas.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;111&#x2F;41&#x2F;14935.full"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pnas.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;111&#x2F;41&#x2F;14935.full</a><p>This effect is called lots of things, including, confusingly, the frequency-following response by some in the private sector. It&#x27;s most often known by the public as brainwave entrainment, but that&#x27;s rarely in the literature. In the literature you see all kinds of words for it: neural entrainment, auditory driving, auditory entrainment, steady state responses of various types... The level of confusion over what to call this thing is only eclipsed by the number of names made up for methods to induce it - all referring to the same thing: rhythmic auditory stimuli. No, better not call it that, in this paper its gonna be sinusoidal amplitude modulation, click trains, acoustic iterance, isochronous auditory stimuli, temporal sound... So, it gets a bit crazy when you try to search for this stuff (so we&#x27;ll be adding even more to our bibliography&#x2F;research library soon. Let me know if you haven&#x27;t seen that yet).<p>For the sake of this post let&#x27;s just call it Entrainment.<p>Something that&#x27;s also being figured out is how to define when exactly Frequency Following ends and Entrainment begins. Some say it doesn&#x27;t matter, others say it&#x27;s when the phase lines up, or if the new rhythm persists even when the external stimuli is removed, as in the article I linked you to. There&#x27;s also ways to approximate the root source of a neural rhythm (external or internal), if you also feed the stimuli into the analysis at the same exact time.<p>Anyway, to sum it up, what we&#x27;re doing is creating a rhythmic stimuli that resembles frequencies already in your brain. We play that stimuli long and consistently enough to actually register a pretty solid response on an EEG.<p>Of course, it gets more complicated than that. This is the brain we&#x27;re talking about. The waveform of the audio modulations matters (brainwaves aren&#x27;t perfect sine waves, after all), the way the frequency is changed over time matters. When do you take a break from the stimulation? When do you tone it down, or turn it up? And how do you adapt to people on an individual level? How do you measure it? Audio processing can change dramatically in the brain depending on the content of the audio!<p>But at any rate, changing the brainwaves of a person like this can also change their mental state. I&#x27;m not saying it takes over the brain. It just.. nudges it a bit in the right direction.<p>So that&#x27;s the basic outline from that perspective. Hope it makes sense, of course if you have any questions don&#x27;t hesitate.<p>2) Brain.fm: The Music Perspective<p>From an audio&#x27;s point of view, we&#x27;re doing a number of things to subtly create that necessary rhythmic stimulus.<p>a) We&#x27;re modulating every piece of audio. It&#x27;s these modulations that create a rapid rhythmic stimulus. If you listen carefully to Brain.fm, you may hear a fluttering sound. It&#x27;s more obvious in some parts over others. We&#x27;re using filtering techniques to target some frequency bands over others (and by frequency here, I&#x27;m now talking about the frequencies of pitch, not brainwaves, where a cello would be low and a violin would be high in frequency). Doing this, we can single out instruments, modulate parts of a nature soundscape but not others, or disguise the modulations as vibrator, tremolo, or the natural vibrations of instruments, strings or the LFOs of electronic music..<p>b) We align everything else in the session to the brain-frequency we&#x27;re trying to hit, so there is no interference from a stray drum beat or a snapping twig. Not only is there no interference, but the entire audio &quot;scene&quot; is being actively used to guide your brain toward the goal state.<p>The 3D audio also factors into this a lot, because the mind pays attention to motion, and that helps elliminate habituation. But that&#x27;s another story.<p>Hope this helped explain it. Completely understand if you need clarification, or an entirely new answer hah!<p>:)<p>- Adam from Brain.fm",2016-02-23 02:41:07,11156084

403,"No it doesn&#x27;t scale 1:1 or any way else at least not in any specific manner.<p>The scaling depends on how much lift you generate, the lift is a question of speed and your the available lift surface the nominal lift produced is then divided by surface area to give you your wing loading.<p>Solar is pretty much the most inefficient way of powering virtually any aircraft because you needlessly increase the weight of the lifting surface and batteries weight considerably more than fuel and that weight is dead weight during the entire flight while a fueled aircraft becomes lighter.<p>That said the scaling between the volume and the &quot;surface area&quot; isn&#x27;t even in question here because you are going to be hitting a wall much quicker and that&#x27;s takeoff weight as mentioned before lift is a factor of the surface area that can provide lift and the speed of the aircraft (as well as air density and some other things but lets ignore it) the heavier the aircraft the more energy you need to actually get to takeoff speeds, and when you make your lift surface bigger you increase drag as well as weight.<p>The speed you can reach is going to be more or less limited because even a 100% efficiency solar powered engines are going to be limited to the max cell efficiency * cell surface area, the 2nd part of the equation is your wing surface and eventually there is a limit to how big your wings can be and still support themselves and most importantly not flutter.
When you take all that and more into account there is absolutely no fucking way that you&#x27;ll make an aircraft capable of lifting a 50,000lbs of crago, heck you won&#x27;t build a solar aircraft capable of lifting 50,000 lbs of anything including itself. To put that into perspective 50,000lbs is 1&#x2F;6th of the maximum structural load that a 747-8F (freighter) can carry, and about 1&#x2F;4th of the nominal cargo load.<p>To put it into even more perspective Solar Impulse weights 3000 lbs, it&#x27;s maximum takeoff weight is about 4000 lbs and it has a max speed of 80km&#x2F;h with a wing span greater than that of a 747.
To put it simply there is no freaking way to scale this up, there is a good reason why nature haven&#x27;t developed heavy flyers the heaviest bird capable of flight weights 35 lbs, the rule of thumb is that when you double the weight you need a 4th time as much wing area and spend 4 times more calories to achieve flight and while mechanical flight isn&#x27;t exactly the same it&#x27;s not that different - the amount of energy you can produce more or less limits how well you can fly because at the end if you stick 2 SRB&#x27;s to a cargo container you don&#x27;t even need wings.<p>P.S.
And that&#x27;s before we getting into finding a material light enough to be viable for solar flight while still being able to bare the load of 50,000 lbs without collapsing, but even if you&#x27;ll take perfect carbon nano tubes or any other super material you still won&#x27;t be getting off the ground.<p>If you want solar cargo air transport blimps are probably the way to go...",2016-04-24 13:41:31,11559652

I learned this technique in 1998 or 1999 from a Yale or Harvard swimmer home on vacation in Sierra Madre, CA. He was doing this crazy sideways kick thing, and when I asked him about he said his coach had them doing it because if you tried to do a pure kick version of the butterfly from a normal face-down position you lost too much range of motion in the small of your back. I already knew other coaches encouraged on-your-side flutter kick practice to get more comfortable swimming on your side (most of the drag you experience has to do with surface interactions, so rolling your body to get it farther from the surface helps with drag, just like submarines can commonly go faster than surface ships).

I remember when we first started Topup Genie in 2009. We had to pay GTBank&#x2F;Interswitch N150,000 of which we were able to get N75,000 waived just to begin to accept payments AND pay them a percentage of our income.
5 years ago in 2011, we built the payment piece of Topup Genie out as a service so other people didn&#x27;t need to pay the N150,000 to integrate, but rather could just ride on ours for a flat N5 fee per transaction.<p>What Flutterwave is doing might seem so basic in the US or Europe, but I know how many of us have had to pave the way for a Flutterwave to emerge.<p>What are the plans for rolling out pan-Africa?",2016-08-10 17:45:20,12263533

Flutter uses the Dart language, so there&#x27;s a Dart environment included in Fuchsia too [2].<p>For rendering, Fuchsia includes a project called Escher [3] which is described as a physically based renderer that supports soft shadows, light diffusion and other advanced effects. Looking at the source code, Escher is designed to use either OpenGL or Vulkan as the underlying graphics API. (There&#x27;s an iOS example project included in Escher&#x27;s source tree. Would be interesting to build that.)<p>It&#x27;s not immediately obvious why a lightweight operating system would need a renderer that can do realtime soft shadows and light effects...! But I think the idea here is to build an UI layer that&#x27;s designed from scratch for Google&#x27;s Material design language. Shadows and subtle color reflections are a major part of that &quot;layered paper&quot; aesthetic.<p>So, the stack seems to be: Dart is the language for GUI apps, Flutter provides the widgets, and Escher renders the layers.<p>The underlying application framework is called Mojo [4]. It already offers bindings for Go, Java, JavaScript, Python and Rust in addition to Dart, but maybe those languages are meant for services rather than GUI apps. (At least I can&#x27;t see an easy way to create Flutter widgets from something like Rust without loading the Dart VM.)<p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;flutter.io"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;flutter.io</a><p>[2] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fuchsia.googlesource.com&#x2F;dart_content_handler&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fuchsia.googlesource.com&#x2F;dart_content_handler&#x2F;</a><p>[3] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fuchsia.googlesource.com&#x2F;escher&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fuchsia.googlesource.com&#x2F;escher&#x2F;</a><p>[4] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fuchsia.googlesource.com&#x2F;mojo&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fuchsia.googlesource.com&#x2F;mojo&#x2F;</a>",2016-08-12 01:59:11,12272990

On that first encounter she told me about going to the Methadone clinic every day. At that point she&#x27;d been going for about a month.<p>Little by little she invited me into her life, and I learned that she really was self-medicating with the street pharmacy too. They&#x27;d told her that methadone helps with &#x27;all cravings&#x27;. She was good for about 8 days, then she wrecked her car and had to move back in with her mother... Thenceforth she resumed using cocaine too.<p>In summer 2015, she used Methadone for her opiate addiction, heroin on the days that she didn&#x27;t make it to the methadone clinic before they closed, cocaine for her depression, and alcohol for her anxiety.<p>By August 2015, with my help, she came to appreciate that she &#x27;wished she wasn&#x27;t a drug addict.&#x27; The internet told me that the best way to quit opiates is cold-turkey, which is how she&#x27;d done it previously.<p>But she&#x27;d trained her brain to run on Acetate (the energy-rich breakdown products of ethanol), and became psychotic when the alcohol went away.

These drugs were originally known as sedatives, and do not in any way fix problems for the person they&#x27;re given to.<p>Even though they knew her psychosis was the result of substances, my friend got trapped with a court order to take whatever drugs her psychiatrists think are appropriate. Anti-psychotics (and benzodiazepines) are bad drugs that make people&#x27;s mental problems worse. She stabilizes while in their facilities because she&#x27;s mostly sober. They let her out, and she turns to her old friends provided by the street pharmacy to try to feel better, and before long has to go back to the mental hospital.<p>I can tell when she&#x27;s used cocaine (which she says doesn&#x27;t &#x27;work&#x27; anymore) - it takes a couple hours for her to mostly recover. Methamphetamine makes her psychotic for 3-4 days. In my opinion, stimulants provided by plants are much safer than synthetic amphetamines.<p>Last week I filed a petition with the court to ask them to investigate her court-ordered treatment, which I do not believe has complied with the requirements of the law.<p>I also contacted the local chapter of the ACLU (American Civil Liberties Union) to see if they can lend some assistance. We have the right to refuse medical treatment, unless a psychiatrist thinks you have a &#x27;persistent mental disorder&#x27;, then you have to take whatever psychotropic drugs the psychiatrist thinks you should take.<p>tl&#x2F;dr: The drug problem would be easy to turn into a manageable public health issue if not for modus operandi of the mental health industry, which thinks &quot;palliative care&quot; is the best they can offer.<p>(There&#x27;s a psychiatrist who comments on some of these HN stories.

That story is Flutter, which is Dart running in the Dart VM on mobile devices [1] It is not Dart converted to JavaScript so it can run in any browser, despite the awesome work of the dart2js authors and the relatively new dev_compiler project [2].

However, it&#x27;s been a long time and the pace of Dart transpiling work is too slow.

Its obivious what google thinks how web and mobile apps can be done in the future and even doing it already internaly. tracking Dart from time to time I thought, that it &quot;somewhat died&quot; and never got traction... it still seems so, but seeing what google is doing is encouraging. Its clear that if google thinks that webapps have to be done the angular.dart way, they will do it for the next 8 years or so; if the rest of us thinks that JS thing is the thing, googles way might be the same.<p>For flutter it might be different if Android gets expanded with flutter.<p>I used GWT a few years ago and still have a GWT app in production (which I hope never has to change until decommission).<p>Its not a coincidence that the mentioned GWT app should get replaced with a complete rewrite and we are at the point where we lay out the options to do that. GWT is marked clearly as &quot;dead&quot; for new developments within the clients infrastructure. Angular an reactjs are the recommended frameworks, even node.js and plain JS is a &quot;allowed&quot; option.<p>I do not have preferences for any plain JS or not typesafe languages personaly; but with the history of GWT, Dart or Angular.dart is a hard sell in this situation. Taking the Dart way is similar as we took GWT a few years ago, but even more a lockin into something the rest of us isn&#x27;t doing (that does not mean the best is what others do, but you know what I mean eh?) because Dart is a new language and framework, from where one couldn&#x27;t get away easy. The same applies to GWT; that code gets not compiled without gwt tools after you opted into GWT.<p>I hope Dart is making its way to (perhaps) replace Java in Android or make it into an alternative to the default.<p>For Dart as a Language for the web I don&#x27;t know yet what happens(who knows). 2x productivity improvements for an App as mentioned in the summit talks is really great, and I think google doesn&#x27;t advertise that if not true.

465,"PS:  the nutshell on nuclear-thermal engines is that it allows you to finally break the &quot;tyranny of the rocket equation&quot;.<p>Right now the reason space travel sucks is staging.  To send a small ship to mars, you need a small rocket.  But you have to inject that small rocket into orbit with a medium rocket.  And you have to get that medium rocket out of the atmosphere with a large rocket.  At each stage, the only way you can gain forward speed is by throwing an equal mass backwards (not quite but works for a description).  So to throw a tiny mass where you want it, you need to throw a whole bunch of crap away first to push you.  The Saturn-V rocket was <i>more than 90% fuel by weight</i>.  Chemical rockets are literally just big gas tanks that you can drop part of when they&#x27;re empty so you don&#x27;t have to drag around dead weight, that&#x27;s it.<p>Working temperature is an extremely important factor for the specific impulse (thrust per mass of fuel consumed) a rocket generates.  The hotter the reaction mass, the more thrust you get out of it.  I&#x27;ll come back to this but the point is you need to heat the gas.<p>In chemical rockets the energy source and the reaction mass are integral, you burn the fuel and it uses its hot exhaust as a reaction mass.  The advantage of a nuclear-thermal engine is that they&#x27;re <i>separate</i> - with fission&#x2F;fusion you can heat an immense amount of reaction mass with a small amount of fuel, and <i>you can pick up more reaction mass as you go</i> (via ramscoop).  Suddenly the whole picture changes, because you no longer need to lift the skyscraper full of reaction mass that you don&#x27;t really care about in order to move the tiny spacecraft you do want.  As long as you&#x27;re going fast enough you can ramscoop yourself more from hydrogen that&#x27;s just floating around space at about 1 atom per cm^3.<p>Not only that but nuclear rockets get much hotter than chemical rockets and you could produce about twice the specific impulse, making your reaction mass go a lot farther.<p>Obviously the task of building orbital infrastructure is an immense one.  It&#x27;s a 50-year project, maybe a little less if we pipeline things to push it along.  There is a massive amount of R&amp;D that would have to happen, but almost all of the technology described here literally exists today.  There are no magic materials we need to invent, it&#x27;s just engineering the pieces together.  We have linear induction motors, we have externally-stabilized supertall structures (antenna towers), we have steam catapults, we have nuclear reactors.  We just need to turn them into a launch loop.  And you don&#x27;t even need all that launch capacity, it just makes things easier - Deep Space Industries wants to pull an asteroid in with just small probes, it&#x27;s just going to take a lot, lot longer.  NASA has tested nuclear rockets (NERVA program).  etc etc.  We would have some work to do on implementing a practical ramscoop, and we would need to figure out how to do mining, refining, and fabrication effectively, but those are relatively discrete tasks that are solvable with current technology, it&#x27;s just a matter of figuring out what works and what doesn&#x27;t.<p>Our children could live in an interplanetary (bordering on interstellar) society if we wanted them to, using shit we&#x27;ve got lying around right now.  Our children could walk on other planets and work in space.  They could live to see the first pictures beamed back from another solar system, and if not them then their children would.<p>Throughout history humans have looked up at the stars and wondered what was going on up there.  They watched the gods wander the sky, and made up tales of what they might be doing.  The truth is that we are a unique generation of human beings, because we are the first humans to ever live who have had the planets and the stars in their grasp and yet turned away.  The Greatest Generation didn&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s really only in the last 20-30 years that we have lost our way, but now it&#x27;s just perceived as normal.  Like the grandparent said - a mission to Mars is just some impossible fantasy that&#x27;s always 20 years away.  The truth is that it&#x27;s 20 years away because we never bothered to get started.  It&#x27;s the pile of dishes in our sink that we never wash, or the &quot;check engine&quot; light we always ignore.  It&#x27;s always easier to put it off until tomorrow. We&#x27;re just so busy with [crisis of the day], or the standoff with [enemy of the day], or if there&#x27;s no crisis then taxes need to be cut and there&#x27;s just no money left in the budget to spare.<p>I don&#x27;t particularly care that the moon landings were done out of a sense of nationalistic dick-waving.  We don&#x27;t refuse to drive on the interstates just because they were <i>built</i> so the military could move troops around during World War 3.  We don&#x27;t refuse to use the Internet just because it was <i>designed</i> as a military command-and-control system.  We don&#x27;t refuse to use computers because they were <i>designed</i> to break military codes and simulate the wing flutter of bomber aircraft and the explosions of nuclear warheads.  The history of technological advancement is literally bathed in blood.  I don&#x27;t know for sure but I imagine the first tool humanity ever invented was used to bash someone&#x27;s head in.  The fact that we can reflect on that is the self-awareness we need to come together and make this push for our species&#x27; future.",2016-12-02 22:33:04,13092916

IIRC, he took a surgeon glove, cut off the tips of two fingers, attached one to a tube, and made a knot in the wrist (so it became kind of like a balloon with two openings). The tube was attached to the lung, to drain fluid. The glove was partially submerged in a bucket of water, so it now functioned like a valve: when the patient breathed out, air and fluid could escape from the glove. When he breathed in, the suction plus water pressure would &quot;seal off&quot; the glove.<p>[0] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Flutter_valve"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Flutter_valve</a>",2016-12-18 12:18:56,13205533

557,"I also played with Flutter recently. Timeline: heard Kotlin announcement at I&#x2F;O, went through some Kotlin exercises, wanted to compare with Flutter&#x2F;Dart.<p>Dart feels somewhere in between JavaScript on the one hand and a more-static OO, GC&#x27;d lang w&#x2F;type inference (like Kotlin!) on the other. You can probably look closely at some sample app code and start doing some basic stuff quickly if you&#x27;ve worked much with JS and something more static. (Further study seems worth it if you plan to do a lot, heh!)<p>As others note the UI model seems Reacty--you write &quot;builder&quot; methods that recreate a widget tree when things change, and something behind the scenes sorts out an efficient way to update the screen with just what really changed. I&#x27;m not <i>hugely</i> worried about performance: your UI rebuilds should be separated from your animations, and anyway, building your virtual widget hierarchy ideally shouldn&#x27;t be too CPU intensive in the first place.<p>Hot reload is pretty great. I can&#x27;t actually compare with &quot;real Android&quot; dev, but changes to my little app showed up in under a second in an Android phone, emulated or real. There were a couple surprising things about the basic libs, e.g. Flutter master only recently added a convenience object to bundle together a radio&#x2F;checkbox and its associated label-stuff (RadioListTile).<p>The Flutter Gallery app is available on Google Play and its source is in the Flutter git tree. You can see a lot of the Material widgets implemented, including rich list types (e.g. tiles w&#x2F;photos), pull-from-the-side drawers, top-of-screen tabs you can swipe through, bottom-of-the-screen nav bars etc. Even on iOS Google seems to follow Material guidelines a lot (or at least, the Daring Fireball guy complained that they do; I don&#x27;t have iOS to check), so maybe it&#x27;s the easiest fit if you&#x27;re prepared to do the same. Someone who works on Flutter mentioned elsewhere in these comments that they&#x27;re working on components that look more like the iOS-native ones, though.<p>Although Android Studio is _based on_ IntelliJ, you need to get actual IntelliJ if you want to use the plugin (Studio&#x27;s component versions don&#x27;t match the ones that the Flutter plugin works with, I think). Also, if you have Studio 3.0 canary installed (like to futz w&#x2F;Kotlin, heh!), you need to either configure Flutter to look for the stable Studio 2.3&#x27;s copy of Gradle (flutter config --gradle-dir=...) or just make sure 2.3 is located where the flutter tools look by default (~&#x2F;android-studio for me on Linux).

The startup costs to developing your own library of React components and their CSS&#x2F;Native wrappers are high.<p>That being said, when I think of prebuilt component libraries (eg, bootstrap, swing) I generally think of components that are too familiar for users and a crutch for developers to allow them to quickly develop interface code where they may not be an expert. In a high quality app, I would expect widgets to follow the patterns that other apps on the platform follow. Won&#x27;t this be difficult for a framework like Flutter which will have to re-create each of these native widgets (as apposed to React native where they are just wrapped in a JS layer)?<p>Regardless of these qualms, I&#x27;m excited to see more well funded frameworks enter this space because I&#x27;m sure that all users of frameworks in this space will benefit. I will be on the look out for more complex uses of this framework to see how people overcome these types of issues!",2017-06-23 07:38:09,14617559
599,"Flutter is an amazing project. It feels like an futuristic version of the Android SDK. Everything is a widget and it has a catalog of amazing widgets. These conform to the Material Design guidelines.  It makes it very hassle-free to make a functionally great and beautiful app. You write your Flutter app using Dart. The Dart code is compiled to native code. The more I work with Dart the more I like it. The IntelliJ Flutter plugin makes for a tight and great integration.<p>Right now the weak point of Flutter is that there aren&#x27;t many plugins for utilizing platform specific features. This always the fault line with these cross-platform frameworks. These will come I&#x27;m sure of. It&#x27;s relatively easy to write a plugin which is a great plus.<p>I&#x27;ve done native development on both Android and iOS. Tried Cordova-based development. Lastly React Native.
Out of all these I like Flutter the most. You will make a beautiful app with much less work compared to native development and other alternatives. The performance is also fantastic. Flutter uses its own high-performance rendering engine to draw widgets. Almost the entirety of Flutter is written in Dart; also the lower parts. This is important for development because nothing is closed off. With everything being written in Dart it gives you a high degree of control.<p>My early work so far using Flutter;<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=org.me.tvligenu"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=org.me.tvligen...</a> (Danish television listings)<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=dk.kjeldsen.etherexplorer"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=dk.kjeldsen.et...</a> (Ethereum blockchain explorer)",2017-06-23 07:39:48,14617567

617,"My first problem with Flutter is that it doesn&#x27;t unify web and native development, so it fails to solve the big problem immediately.

React Native (not that I have any great love of React) and its clones are working towards supporting all platforms.<p>My second problem with Flutter is the writer&#x27;s apparent biggest positive feature  Dart. (I love how he naively states that Dart was conceived as a language to transpile to Javascript; it was conceived as a <i>replacement</i> for Javascript with transpilation as a stopgap.) I think Javascript is a fine (&quot;good enough&quot;) language that (a) works almost everywhere and (b) is evolving at a more-than-sufficient rate. I have no desire to drink Google&#x27;s Kool-aid.

The places where it works is in static type systems are used to annotate a dynamic runtime like TypeScript, Hack and (less so) Dart.<p>&gt; All I&#x27;m &quot;throwing shade on&quot; is the idea that users don&#x27;t care about quality, and that static languages have no inherent quality advantages over dynamic languages.

I think it&#x27;s only a matter of time, personally.<p>It doesn&#x27;t exist because it&#x27;s simpler, requires significantly less effort and is more naturally suitable to implement in a dynamic language. In these classes of software choosing a static language is the wrong choice that will always yield inferior results due to their lack of dynamic capabilities and interested resources who naturally gravitate around dynamic language ecosystem. No doubt many devs will still try using their preferred static language but they will all fail to achieve anywhere near the level of success, featureset and penetration of equivalent dynamic language implementations.<p>Of course as it&#x27;s software, given enough resources anything is possible, like Apple is able to do with Swift Playgrounds but they&#x27;re in the unique position of being able to change Swift&#x27;s language and runtime to introduce the capabilities needed to make Swift Playgrounds feasible - which is major strategic project for Apple which I still hold would require significantly less effort using a dynamic language. Google has the same benefits with what they&#x27;re able to do with Dart where their flutter project offers a compelling live programming experience for developing native mobile Apps. Both would be considerably harder if they weren&#x27;t able to change the language and runtime to make it easier for them, e.g. snapshots would be nigh impossible without language&#x2F;runtime support.<p>Likewise their exists classes of performance and mission critical software that&#x27;s not suitable for dynamic languages, but it&#x27;s not always a mistake to start with a dynamic language first to prototype quickly then rewrite once the system requirements have been identified and solidified.",2017-07-01 22:08:17,14679316

The app runs using the native instruction set (no interpreter is involved).<p>Does Flutter use my systems OEM widgets?<p>No. Instead, Flutter provides a set of widgets (including Material Design and Cupertino (iOS-styled) widgets), managed and rendered by Flutters framework and engine. You can browse a catalog of Flutters widgets.<p>We are hoping the end-result will be higher quality apps. If we reused the OEM widgets, the quality and performance of Flutter apps would be limited by the quality of those widgets.<p>In Android, for example, theres a hard-coded set of gestures and fixed rules for disambiguating them. In Flutter, you can write your own gesture recognizer that is a first-class participant in the gesture system. Moreover, two widgets authored by different people can coordinate to disambiguate gestures.<p>Modern app design trends point towards designers and users wanting more motion-rich UIs and brand-first designs. In order to achieve that level of customized, beautiful design, Flutter is architectured to drive pixels instead of the OEM widgets.<p>By using the same renderer, framework, and set of widgets, we make it easier to publish for both iOS and Android concurrently, without having to do careful and costly planning to align two separate codebases and feature sets.<p>By using a single language, a single framework, and a single set of libraries for all of your UI (regardless if your UI is different for each mobile platform or largely consistent), we also aim to help lower app development and maintenance costs.<p>What happens when my mobile OS updates and introduces new widgets?<p>The Flutter team watches the adoption and demand for new mobile widgets from iOS and Android, and aims to work with the community to build support for new widgets. This work may come in the form of lower-level framework features, new composable widgets, or new widget implementations.<p>Flutters layered architecture is designed to support numerous widget libraries, and we encourage and support the community in building and maintaining widget libraries.<p>What happens when my mobile OS updates and introduces new platform capabilities?<p>Flutters interop and plugin system is designed to allow developers to access new mobile OS features and capabilities immediately.

With React Native, the impression was far better because the performance actually can be quite good. But it&#x27;s still hard to abstract the UI layer away when even the native Views on Android behave differently across devices and Android versions. I had to use almost a half of a day for fixing invisible drop-down menu items on some specific Samsung device on Android 4.1.2. Not to mention when you have to abstract the UI for both Android &amp; iOS, which brings its own set of problems. It&#x27;s one of the reasons why such a fundamental thing as navigation has been so hard to get right.<p>I feel Flutter is the first cross-platform SDK that gets something fundamentally right. Since every pixel on the UI is rendered by the framework, we as developers have better control of everything. It&#x27;s going to have much better performance because there are no bridges between native and cross-platform land. Additionally, Samsung can&#x27;t fuck up our UIs: once the UI works, it works the same on every device.<p>As a bonus, they also keep tremendous care of their codebase and they have the best documentation I&#x27;ve ever seen.

From what I could gather, Google acquihired the Apportable team, which then pivoted to Flutter.<p>For anyone that doesn&#x27;t know, Apportable was an Obj-C to native Android compiler. It bypassed the JVM, compiling directly to the native architecture, and actually ran faster than comparable Java apps.

It was mainly targeted at games which used Cocos2D, but a UIKit bridge was in the works...<p>When I first heard about Apportable, I was incredibly wary of their claim, but it worked like absolute magic.

759,"This is really exciting  as someone who spends far too much time messing around making electronic music, I was thinking about how cool it would be to have a voice-to-instrument converter. After all, if a computer can create the sounds of an orchestra or band with just your vocal beatboxing &#x2F; humming chops and a sprinkle of machine learning, then that&#x27;s all you need to make the next hit-song, right?<p>Well  not trying to detract too much from this field  but, that&#x27;s where I think the expectations of grandeur, that some people will get about this emerging technology, are kinda wrong. There are a few issues I can think of that will need to be overcome (if even possible?) before this technology can be considered groundbreaking.<p>From the &#x27;person&#x27; side:
(1) - Vocal range and ability &gt;&gt; This one is going to be most hard as most people can only sing within a couple of octaves, and even then, need quite a bit of &#x27;tuning&#x27; help to identify the right notes &#x2F; intentions. 
(2) Musical theory &gt;&gt; Fitting into the above, if you don&#x27;t have any musical theory knowledge (about what key you&#x27;re supposed to be in, or about chords, or progression), then a machine learning process would have to fill-in all the chords and textures &#x2F; build-up. But that really can only help you so much, unless you&#x27;re just interested in the &#x27;novelty&#x27; aspect of it.<p>From the &#x27;machine&#x27; side:
(3) &#x27;Bum&#x27; notes and &#x27;quantisation&#x27; &gt;&gt; I noticed from the samples that the saxophone would produce flutter around a note, and also the timings weren&#x27;t &#x27;on the beat&#x27;  but this should be quite trivial. 
(4) Expressiveness &gt;&gt; Right now, the instruments might be adjusting to the input velocities (loudness), but if you want a life-like sax sound then you&#x27;ll need to produce a level of expressiveness that makes it sound realistic... This can be achieved with a mixture of better (available) virtual instrumentation, and also ML to figure out what the best intentions are of the input<p>I think the two big key factors are musical theory and expressiveness. With the former, I think anyone who has a good enough understanding of musical theory probably wouldn&#x27;t have much of a use for this other than a novelty until it produces compelling, effortless results. This is because they&#x27;re most likely to have some kind of instrumental knowledge (keyboard most specifically for virtual instruments) and music composition experience. The two groups this kind of tech would really help are a) very good vocalists who have no electronic composition experience but a good grasp of music theory  Michael Jackson is a good example of this as this is how he made his song ideas[0], and b) music producers &#x2F; instrumentalists that want to &#x27;fill-in&#x27; a lot of parts quickly by humming &#x2F; beatboxing  but again, they can probably do this with a keyboard reasonably effortlessly. If the &#x27;expression&#x27; is worked on a lot, then it will become more interesting as expressive effects are hard to get right without expensive hardware.

771,"I know some people simply need spontaneity to be creative, but I think most people are fine being creative on a schedule. One of the most powerful quotes from Stephen King&#x27;s book &quot;On Writing&quot;:<p>&quot;There is a muse, but hes not going to come fluttering down into your writing room and scatter creative fairy-dust all over your typewriter or computer. He lives in the ground. Hes a basement kind of guy. You have to descend to his level, and once you get down there you have to furnish an apartment for him to live in. You have to do all the grunt labor, in other words, while the muse sits and smokes cigars and admires his bowling trophies and pretends to ignore you. Do you think its fair? I think its fair. He may not be much to look at, that muse-guy, and he may not be much of a conversationalist, but hes got inspiration. Its right that you should do all the work and burn all the mid-night oil, because the guy with the cigar and the little wings has got a bag of magic. Theres stuff in there that can change your life. Believe me, I know.&quot;<p>I think most on Hacker News would agree with this sentiment. If you aren&#x27;t putting in the work how can you expect the muse to give you inspiration? You must lay the framework of creativity in your mind in order for it to strike. It is like the medium of an agar plate you use to grow critters in a lab, only in your mind you must create this medium by hard work and laying the framework. Sure inspiration strikes at times with or without this work, but (for me) it reliably strikes when I put in the work.<p>GTD is almost meta to this. It is just a system to keep your plate free to do your important work and prioritize your important work. It eliminates the mental clutter so you can focus on what is important. Many other productivity and self help systems all go down that same path. But it doesn&#x27;t get at the core discipline of being regular and scheduled that is almost a requirement as a professional.",2017-11-21 18:52:40,15750483

Hopefully WebAssembly will cure this down the road who knows. For example, it&#x27;s almost 2018 and folks are <i>still</i> trying to settle on something as fundamental as React Native navigation. I guess with the dev landscape now the JS love&#x2F;hate varies.<p>Re the hiring pool that&#x27;s a great point. But hiring JS devs sometimes is like hiring PHP devs: if you&#x27;re doing something simple it&#x27;s no problem, but more complex then you get lots of horrible candidates to sift through until you hopefully manage to find someone good&#x2F;with a proper programming education. But I guess it also greatly depends on the hiring location too.<p>Re adoption, I think if you&#x27;re a web dev already, you&#x27;re used to it, but if you&#x27;re a backend dev or native mobile dev it&#x27;s something hard to deal with.<p>I guess I can point out some situations:<p>1.

Not a great selling point there.<p>So, if you&#x27;re a web developer, you have to learn a new language, framework (whatever Flutter uses) and set of APIs.

&gt; Our phytomass harvests go beyond the metabolic needs to secure raw materials (wood, fibers, pulp) and energy (fuelwood, charcoal, straw) whose inputs remain indispensable even in the age of metals, concrete, synthetics, and fossil fuels. The biosphere has paid a considerable price for these human gains as both its total stock of standing phytomass and its overall productivity have declined by significant margins. And because we are an omnivorous species we have also been harvesting a wide variety of zoomass by collecting and hunting animals as foragers and eventually also deliberately raising them as pastoralists and farmers.

855,"I started with Flutter a year and a half ago after reading an article about it.<p>Overall, I like working with Dart! Why? I feel very productive with the language.<p>Pros:<p><pre><code>  1. The Standard Lib is fairly complete and coherent. This makes it easy to learn and create reusable libraries that fit together in a larger ecosystem.
  2. Dart can run in a JIT mode and compiled mode. JIT mode is great for fast development cycles (Flutter Hot Reload or running tests), compiled mode is great for fast production apps.
  3. Built in primitives for async: Futures and Streams. This makes working with async code consistent and readable.
  4. Good tooling -- VSCode and IntelliJ plugins both offer high quality editing experiences, with type checking, refactoring, jump-to-definition, etc.
  5. Solid test package with very fast feedback. It also works out of the box with the IntelliJ test runner.
  6. Good package management. It&#x27;s easy to pull libraries from the central registry (pub) or work with local versions of a dependency by simply pointing to the correct local directory. Easy to split your own apps into several smaller libs that depend on each other for separation as well!
  7. Strong typing with good type inference -- I&#x27;ve worked on large javascript and java apps, and I find strong typing really helps on bigger projects. Java has great tooling, but is notorious for repetition (I just told you it was a String!!! :P)
  8. Easy to share code between web and mobile projects. 50-70% code sharing according to folks at Google and AppTree.
</code></pre>
Cons:<p><pre><code>  1. Smaller community, less 3rd party packages. This can be a pro in some cases, as I&#x27;ve found the packages that are available tend to be of high quality.
  2. Might be missing Feature X from your favorite language (Kotlin  extension functions, Scala case classes &amp; pattern matching, Idris dependent types, etc).
  3. For advanced cases, I don&#x27;t love the way class constructors work... sometimes you have to provide an internal private constructor to make the language happy and external `factory` constructors for consumers.
  4. It sometimes feels like other languages might be moving a bit faster. For example, Kotlin is adding features at an incredible pace! That said, Dart2 is just around the corner and it sounds like the team is doing a lot of refactoring on a &quot;Common Front End&quot; to make moving faster in a safe way much easier.

Performance, I didn&#x27;t do any benchmarks, but a simple list with thousands of items feels much smoother on flutter than react native. 
There are packages for redux as well in flutter, so state management is taken care of [2].

As mobile devices get bigger - big phones, tablets, pixel thingies or whatever - it&#x27;d be nice to port existing software to them. But that means we need a GUI toolkit, not a new language.<p>For example, whatever Google&#x27;s new Fuchsia OS is going to run on, they use flutter. Is every app for the OS supposed to be written in Dart? If so screw that. It&#x27;s been tried with Java (Android), Objective C (Apple), Swift (Apple), Javascript (Web), Visual Basic (not really, but MS). And while it&#x27;s not always the only choice on a platform, each of these was the preferred language. People have to stop telling programmers what language to use.

925,Well Flutter does provide for a way to call into existing native code so I think that mitigates the code-reuse concern.

Writing apps for iOS &amp; Android always meant having a C&#x2F;C++ core with platform-specific shims; J2Objc more recently let you write it in Java but again that just lets you write the core in Java with 2 platform-specific independent frontend implementations. A lot of developers just wound up writing the app twice &amp; shifting as much logic server-side as possible (which hurts battery too).  This is the first time you can write the app once &amp; run on both iOS &amp; Android.  AFAIK Dart is also only a requirement for the front-end.  You are still free to use whatever language you want for your business logic.  I&#x27;m not 100% clear yet on how good the bridging story is but I suspect it&#x27;s not bad.,2018-02-27 19:15:05,16476842

If Dart had been less efficient, then we&#x27;d quickly see it in the profiles as a problem.

928,"Basically because a UI framework&#x27;s usability is directly related to how idiomatic it feels. So if you write a UI framework in C for C, it will feel nicer than a UI framework in Python for C, or in C for Python. This directly translates into how productive developers can be using the framework, which is one of our top priorities.<p>When we started, about 3 years ago now, we looked at many languages (dozens of them) and, objectively, Dart was the best fit for what we wanted to build.<p>At the time, &quot;we&quot; was a few people from the Chrome team, and me (HTML spec editor at the time). We were all Web people, whose only impression of Dart was somewhat like negative comments in the thread here. When we studied each language, though, we found that impression was really not relevant to Dart as a language for mobile, and in fact it fared better in our comparisons than the other languages we looked at.<p>I think it would make a lot of sense for people to create other projects very similar to Flutter where Skia is combined not with the Dart VM but with other languages, and for the Flutter framework to be ported -- in a language-idiomatic manner -- to those other languages. I can totally imagine, for instance, a TypeScript-based UI framework like Flutter, or a Kotlin-based UI framework like Flutter, or a Swift-based UI framework like Flutter. After all, in many ways, Flutter is just an evolution of previous UI frameworks like React, DOM&#x2F;CSS, UIKit, and Android views.<p>Let a thousand flowers bloom.

When we&#x27;ve investigated performance issues in the past, it&#x27;s usually turned out to be around graphics or bad algorithms in the framework. Our most recent performance issue was related to compiling shaders on the fly; turns out if your shaders are super-optimised to render scenes really quickly, they can end up being so expensive to compile in the first place that you miss a frame or two when you first try to show the scene.<p>&gt; I heard here that it enforces static typing<p>Sort of. It&#x27;s more that the compiler does type inference if you don&#x27;t specify types (as opposed to just not having any static types). You can still explicitly specify &quot;dynamic&quot; as a type, and generally if you just don&#x27;t mention types it feels dynamic, still.

I didnt try it personally, so am unsure how it affects the quality in practice.<p>It&#x27;s not just about continuity. It also removes an entire set of concerns from the process.<p>For example-- suppose someone analyzes an audio recording, splits it into grains, then does some fancy re-organization based on the timbral content of the recording&#x2F;grains.<p>Now suppose they are subjectively unhappy with the result. Perhaps it sounds &quot;wimpy,&quot; &quot;fluttery,&quot; or some other such vague complaint. Is that sound due to a) their process of re-organizing the grains, b) the quality of the original recording, c) the envelopes they used, or d) something else entirely?<p>If instead one uses grains which begin and end at zero, the answer can&#x27;t be C because it doesn&#x27;t exist.

If you plan to write your app solely in Dart&#x2F;Flutter then youre probably perfectly fine. But can you really tell in advance, you wont ever need to rewrite some performance critical parts of your app in native language?
With Flutter, you are forced to make this decision early as your app needs to written solely in Dart and Flutter. The reason is Flutters widgets. They are not native widgets, but rather just imitation. In reality all Flutter widgets has to be rewritten from scratch. But there always will be some visual differences between Flutter and native widgets. Mixing them in single application will end up in inconsistent look. And your users will notice.<p>For that reason I personally prefer react-native or native script. Both allow you to write some parts of applications in native language and some parts in js. But look will be consistent, because both are just wrappers over native components.<p>However the good thing about Dart is that its compiled to machine code, which in theory makes it faster then react-native js bridge. But downside is, you need to learn new language, which you really cant use somewhere else. (yes I know you can transpile to js, but who is really doing it?)",2018-04-08 15:26:34,16786510
1052,"&gt; You&#x27;re entirely right insofar as (eg) an Android developer will learn iOS far faster than someone without mobile (or any other ui kit) experience. But the specifics are different enough such that it&#x27;s hard to do both to a high level. Or perhaps I&#x27;m just speaking for my own limitations -- I do iOS &amp; Android (native &amp; a bit of react native), but I&#x27;m definitely less of an expert with either (or the various server things I also do) than I would be if I specialised.<p>Yeah, that&#x27;s definitely true pretty much why projects like react native and flutter exist. I personally have done toy projects on iOS and Android, but do not do it for my day job (and really have no desire to), so I stick to projects like react native and flutter and try to avoid mobile development like the plague.<p>&gt; I was offering AWS as an example of another platform rather than a language.

AWS can be come so complex so fast, especially when they have many ways to do the same thing (often built upon each other) and it isn&#x27;t necessarily immediately clear which is the best for your usecase. The additional management they give you for some services is minimal -- I&#x27;m thoroaughly convinced that most of the &quot;value&quot; offered by RDS is more-or-less thanks to tools like postgres being well-written&#x2F;robust software.<p>I agree on the language being relatively trivial too -- maybe the importance of platforms ties into that -- Once the language difference becomes trivial the next big differentiator must indeed be platforms&#x2F;the well-used structures that are built on the base language.

There are a few people who have commit rights to the repo, so who actually control what goes in and what doesn&#x27;t, but they are generally willing to let in changes that have broad support, and are implementable, rather than letting such features get held up by political processes.<p>Besides the difference in structure, there&#x27;s just a difference in attitudes. The W3C tends to strongly favor certain principles, like accessibility and modularity, but to the exclusion of compromise for technical reasons or real-world reasons. They also seem to have a tendency to get very attached to particular ways of doing things, without being willing to compromise. I think the biggest example of this was longdesc; it was never implemented properly in pretty much any browser, and very few people actually followed the spec and had it point to a URL (many people just copied the alt tag, or provided a longer description in the attribute instead of a URL), so even if browsers or screen readers had implemented it, the content wouldn&#x27;t be useful. But people in the W3C made a big stink about removing this, and spent a lot of time and effort fighting and litigating over that, rather than actually trying to work on a different feature that could gain wider adoption.<p>The WHATWG tends to take a more pragmatic approach; pave the cowpaths, if there are differences between implementations do it in the most sensible way that preserved compatibility.<p>Now, what the WHATWG has produced hasn&#x27;t always been the best; there are times when it&#x27;s made mistakes in its approach. The drag and drop spec, which had been reverse-engineered from IE&#x27;s drag and drop support, was a pretty bad; not sure if it&#x27;s gotten better since.<p>But overall, the WHATWG has been a lot more productive in getting standards done that are actually used on the web, because they involve the implementers, and don&#x27;t override them with tedious, drawn out, political battles over obscure features that no one uses.",2018-04-13 19:42:38,16833285
1082,"I originally wanted to build an email client fully in the browser, but realized I can&#x27;t do TCP connections (for IMAP) directly inside the browser.<p>I came up with a few alternative:<p>&quot;Hosted&quot; version:<p>Hosted service that runs IMAP on a back-end, and roughly &quot;proxies&quot; IMAP over a WebSocket. This is the best for the user, because no download&#x2F;setup, just a web page. This also enabled easy push notification (IDLE process on back-end -&gt; push notifications).

Our software lets thousands of small business owners (and their accountants) run their payrolls without headaches, so they can focus on the challenge of building their businesses.<p>Do you believe most SPAs are a pile of steaming crap, but wouldn&#x27;t mind digging into Vue.js for pages that will benefit from the increased interactivity?
Do you laugh when people give up the power of PostgreSQL in favour of data stores that don&#x27;t offer any benefits for their use case?
If so, you may fit in well with our mindset.<p>The work will include: Doing direct integrations with banks that offer good APIs. Expanding our API for other systems to integrate with us. Adding new features. Optimising for performance. Integrating with government systems. Squashing bugs. Eventually, the opportunity to do some mobile development (probably using Flutter).<p><i>Experience</i>: Due to our full pipeline, we can only hire developers who have a few years of Rails experience at this time. Previous experience with remote work would be a bonus - we need people who understand the challenges and can share what they&#x27;ve learnt.<p><i>Location</i>: Most of the team is in GMT+2, and I&#x27;ll be in GMT+8 going forward.

The only winglike thing that messes with the viscous boundary layer is a VG. Second, winglets have nothing to do with a &quot;mixing boundary;&quot; They do what they do, even in completely inviscid flow, where there is no boundary layer. Third, whether an air mass has to &quot;accelerate&quot; has nothing to do with efficiency. For example, air is adiabatically compressed as it meets the stagnation point on a wing, or en masse as it enters a subsonic diffuser (jet intake). The former is a consequence of fluid flow in general, and the latter is by design. Both are completely isentropic and lead to no total pressure losses in the flow.<p>Finally, it&#x27;s meaningless to say that wings &quot;can be designed to have...arbitrary amounts of lift,&quot; and plainly incorrect to say that drag is the &quot;secret sauce.&quot; (Aeroelastic flutter? Wing mass? Control moments? Moment coefficients?) Reducing induced drag is done in exactly two ways.

Adding new features. Optimising for performance. Integrating with government systems. Squashing bugs. Eventually, the opportunity to do some mobile development (probably using Flutter).<p>Experience: Due to our full pipeline, we can only hire developers who have a few years of Rails experience at this time.

1181,"There are several aspects of Flutter that are compelling. The two which I find the most interesting are speed of development and the platform independence when designing the app.<p>Speed of development: I&#x27;ve seen Flutter development referred to as a &quot;double hot reloading&quot; dev paradigm: UI and app logic. Hot-reloading the UI on design changes isn&#x27;t new (React Native, NativeScript, and even Xamarin can do this) but the team at Google made a purpose-built debugging compiler for Flutter which separates state management from the app logic so if you&#x27;re working on code deep into an app and need to fix something in the logic, the executing code is reloaded while the app&#x27;s state and UI remain where they are so you don&#x27;t have to start over from the launch screen, log in, start your transaction&#x2F;order&#x2F;process..... This process cycle -- launch, login, start an order, get to the state of an order to test the logic I just altered -- used to consume five to ten minutes per iteration when I was doing Xamarin work. Being able to edit and re-run the application logic without losing state and starting over is HUGE!<p>Platform independence: the UI for Flutter apps doesn&#x27;t rely on the native OS widgets of iOS or Android (or Fuchsia!) but a C++ layer that bundles and ships with the app in question. It&#x27;s akin to building a business app in game template where you can custom-define everything about the UI and any widgets you want to use... a lot of work but they will look and act the same on iOS and Android (and Fuchsia) and presumably run fast.  This is a massive difference from Xamarin where cross-platform apps end up using the platform-native widgets which is known to result in non-trivial amounts of &quot;if (Platform_Android) {...} else if (Platform_iOS) {...}&quot; or just going the more sure-fire way of not entering Xamarin-debug-hell: make the UI for your app using the platform-specific Xamarin-tooling and move as much code to the share logic layers which don&#x27;t need to be changed between Android and iOS.<p>The final thing I&#x27;ll say about Flutter: I told a colleague who thinks that C++ is the <i>ideal</i> cross-platform mobile language about Flutter. Two weeks later he came back, told me he made a demo app with it, then decompiled the resulting IPA and APK files to inspect the assembly code and he concluded that it was essentially the same as if the app had been written in C++ from the get-go. I&#x27;ll take his word for it since I lack the skills to verify that for myself but it certainly speaks well for the performance potential of Flutter!",2018-06-03 13:05:23,17219322

Get a significant number of client-side web developers that were using JavaScript to move to Dart.<p>It&#x27;s probably not obvious, but these goals are in tension with each other. In order to motivate adding a giant new VM to a browser, you need to make the language pretty different from JS. Likewise, you need to make your implementation much faster than JS.<p>Both of those push you down a path where interop with JS is difficult. You don&#x27;t want your language&#x27;s semantics too close to JS because that reduces the value proposition of the language. And you don&#x27;t want JS interop requirements to limit how you implement the VM around things like garbage collection.<p>But for (2), to get people to move, you need the absolute smoothest migration path you can get. You&#x27;ll make all sorts of compromises and edge cases in your new language to reduce friction when getting developers to migrate to yours and you&#x27;ll do anything to make interop seamless to support heterogeneous projects. (For example, TypeScript pokes quite large holes in its type system in order to play nicer with JS idioms.)<p>The Dart leads prioritized (1) over (2). The idea was that the VM would be so great users would flock to it giving us (2). That didn&#x27;t work out, unfortunately. In practice, I think it&#x27;s very hard to create a language implementation so much better that it trumps the value of existing code. So you really do need to win at (2) at all costs, if you want to a successful web-only client-side language.<p>That&#x27;s the approach TypeScript has taken, and they did a fantastic job at it. Having one of the world&#x27;s best language designers doesn&#x27;t hurt.<p>In the past couple of years, in response to this and other changes in the landscape, we pivoted Dart. We now aim to be a <i>multi-platform</i> client-side language. In particular, we&#x27;re the application language of Flutter, a cross-platform mobile framework.<p>Flutter is a very different platform than the web -- there isn&#x27;t an existing entrenched corpus of billions of lines of code. Performance and memory usage matters more. You can&#x27;t JIT on all platforms. Developers coming to Flutter are equally likely to be coming from Android (Java) and iOS (Objective-C, Swift) as they are the web.<p>Those different constraints play well to Dart&#x27;s strengths. And, in particular, they align nicely with Dart&#x27;s move to a full, sound static type system. Dart 2 is more &quot;C# with less boilerplate&quot; than &quot;JS with more types&quot;.<p>Dart is still <i>also</i> a web language, and the better static type system really helps with static compilation to JS, but it&#x27;s not our only path to success.",2018-06-06 17:50:53,17249355

1228,"I&#x27;ll try and boil it down to some points that hopefully build on each other:<p>- In the mobile development there are a few approaches, including but not limited to: full-native, near-native, and webview (these aren&#x27;t official terms, I just made them up)<p>- &quot;full-native&quot; is using Java on Android, Swift&#x2F;ObjC on iOS, generally implying using all the tooling&#x2F;patterns&#x2F;etc that come. This is the hardest in terms of learning curve, Swift concepts often do not translate to android, so it&#x27;s like two steep climbs.<p>- &quot;near-native&quot; is using some library&#x2F;tool that compiles down to JVM bytecode&#x2F;native code but usually implies bringing in new&#x2F;alternative tooling (integration levels vary) that holds the promise of having less warts. This is where tools like React Native[0], Vue Native[1], NativeScript[2] fit in (I&#x27;ll explain how later).<p>- &quot;webview&quot; is when you just make a mobile-friendly webpage and embed it inside an app by simply displaying it fullscreen. Android&#x2F;iOS also has features these days where you can pin webpages that act like mobile apps to screens, and IIRC android &quot;instant&quot; apps are the same concept. These have been criticized heavily for performance&#x2F;platform integration issues. This is where tools like Cordova[3] and Ionic[4] fit in.<p>SIDENOTE: FirefoxOS (RIP) was a mobile OS that took this to the extreme, having everything just be a webview and investing in the browser ecosystem heavily.<p>- In terms of difficulty&#x2F;ramp-up-time&#x2F;vendor-lockin, webview &lt; near-native &lt; native -- assuming that you know web tech already, and that the near-native toolchain is indeed easier.<p>- While React[7] started by targeting the web exclusively (though I think it might have always been a goal to branch out), they built in enough generalization to support react-native, whose feature is that it moved the boundaries a bit -- it works using native platform code to run a JS processing thread, and offers interop to native features directly. So it&#x27;s not a webview, and not completely native, it belongs in the near-native camp but it uses concepts that allows you to treat it almost like a webview app.<p>- The existence of React Native is a huge difference-maker for react. If you want to sell your team on react, the ability for a frontend developer to easily handle mobile application development is a strong selling point.<p>- Since react native&#x27;s near-native mechanism is well known, other projects have started to incorporate it -- Angular[5] proponents (and actually any js app in general) can use NativeScript[2] and Vue[6] proponents has been working on Vue Native[1] for a while.<p>- React Native, Vue Native, NativeScript are all attempts to bring the render-in-a-thread, shim-to-native-code-where-possible paradigm to different frontend frameworks that have existed.<p>- There are differences between Angular, React, and Vue that make it difficult for one project to interface with all of them (theoretically NativeScript could do it, as it supports any old JS app), and those differences are often opportunities for tight integration and developer ergonomics&#x2F;features.<p>- In the end, all this is meant to enable native-feeling application development with minimal vendor&#x2F;SDK lock-in and difficulty.<p>- There are other interesting approaches in the near-native space like <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;flutter.io&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;flutter.io&#x2F;</a> (almost like web view except natively by drawing every pixel on the screen) and <a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lambdanative.org&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lambdanative.org&#x2F;</a> (take a small lisp runtime with you)<p>[EDIT] - As pointed out in the subcomments on this post, React Native does not &#x27;compile down&#x27; to native code -- that is true.

You also wont have the benefit of community established best practices to save you from making costly mistakes.<p>To choose between native and react-native, list the functionality that your app will have, and see if react-native has good support for it.

- Dont be fooled by its simplicity. You can make an app in hours, but if its non trivial you will require more time to really polish it
- React code can get messy fast, its easy to lose track of where state changes happen. Choosing a well known architecture and sticking with it (ex: redux) is super helpful as complexity grows
- to get to 60fps, you need to be very precise on how and when to make state&#x2F;U.I updates, so the optimization phase can take a while. I often end up going through all components in a tree to manually disable un-necessary re-renders, or delay re-rendering after some animation has completed.
- dont use react-router, its not suited for native needs (it keeps all previous views from the stack active which creates all sorts of problems)<p>Compared to learning two languages for making an iOS and Android app, react native is incredibly fast and efficient, especially when you come from the web.

But in contrast to RN, Dart 2 is statically typed and AOT compiled into native ARM which enables better performance and doesn&#x27;t have any of the JS VM issues Airbnb kept running into. I also prefer Flutter&#x27;s x-plat approach of drawing all their widgets with Skia as it also mitigates the UI widget inconsistencies they would&#x27;ve had if they tried to wrap native widgets.

They added optional nullability syntax to objective-c, a language that assumes everything is null and doesn&#x27;t crash when you send a message to nil.  If your file uses nullability, it&#x27;s required for the file, otherwise you don&#x27;t have to use it.  Code without nullability annotations using non-null annotated code could interface with the non-nullable code.  Errors didn&#x27;t come up unless you did very obvious things like directly put nil in a non-null argument.<p>2. They migrated their entire apple library base to have proper nullability annotations.  Code that didn&#x27;t have nullability annotations continued to work fine.  Or I think you could just turn off the build error with a compiler flag.<p>3. Apple introduced swift.  Any objective-c code that didn&#x27;t have nullability defined was assumed to be an implicitly unwrapped non-null.  So if you give a null to something not expecting a nil in swift, it would crash.<p>Apple has a blog article specifying it further here: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.apple.com&#x2F;swift&#x2F;blog&#x2F;?id=25"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.apple.com&#x2F;swift&#x2F;blog&#x2F;?id=25</a><p>-----<p>I liked this approach for the most part.

1321,"To summarize, Flutter provides no automated or easy means to save&#x2F;restore state when Android auto-kills the app (e.g. because of low memory). The main problem here is that the `onSaveInstanceState` and `onRestoreInstanceState` lifecycle callbacks require a synchronous response (return value) but the IPC system between Dart and native code is inherently asynchronous.<p>React Native currently has the very same problem.

I don&#x27;t know if I like this idea, but it seems to be the direction we&#x27;re heading to. We started with the browser being a system to access documents that can link to each other, and at some point a scripting language was introduced.

1386,"Firebase is very much easy to get started for mobile apps. You have nice console to create project, and as developer you deal with just its SDK, one CLI and simple API. For something similar to Firebase in AWS, you need to make use of Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, Cognito separate products, which has steep learning curve. And then you need to know the AIM security to get started. AWS has a Mobile Hub product which is trying to make things easy to create mobile apps by automate some of these AWS products for you. So now you have to learn awsmobile CLI tool on top of the core awscli tool. And if you develop for the web, they have this AWS Amplify Javascript library on top of basic JS SDK library which has a higher abstraction thus to make things simple (or worst). If you&#x27;re new to AWS, you often struggle with which library should one learn and use. And if you use AWS Ampify and read the documents, it is as if the library is build for React. I&#x27;m not sure why AWS can be so married to one web stack. So much emphasis and priority is given to React and React Native in this library. They will give the excuse that React is what their customer wants. They now have mature React&#x2F;React Native Amplify library thus giving the impression that to use AWS its better to use React&#x2F;React Native. So they spend resource on AWS-Amplify, even move one of JS cognate-identity-js SDK under this umbrella, hoping the world will standardised on JavaScript and React Native for iOS, Android and web. So what happen if you&#x27;re developing a mobile app using Unity, Xamarin and Flutter? No luck as they only have SDK for iOS, Android and web. Compare this with Firebase that has SDK for iOS, Android, web, Xamarin, Unity, Flutter and C++. AWS has an opportunity in AppSync to make a product as easy to get started as Firebase. What is required is native mobile SDK for iOS, Android, web, Flutter, Unity, Xamarin that is not just specific to AppSync and GraphQL, but also add in authentication, analytics etc APIs.

    &gt; languages like erlang and recently, dart?
</code></pre>
Considering Inko is still very new, right now there isn&#x27;t really a reason that
justifies using it in production. Of course in a year or two (depending on how
fast things go) that might completely changes.<p>Ignoring the maturity aspect, Dart and Inko are pretty different. Dart focuses
more on browsers and mobile (with Flutter), whereas Inko focuses more on backend
services (a web app, a key&#x2F;value store, that kind of thing). In case of Dart the
focus directly affects the language, as for example symbol mangling (to compress
the source code) means reflection is harder (IIRC Dart&#x27;s mirror implementation
is in a state of limbo because of this).<p>Erlang is much closer to Inko conceptually, though the two languages are quite
different, with Erlang being functional and Inko being object-oriented.
Competing with Erlang will be very hard: it&#x27;s well established, mature, has a
healthy ecosystem, etc. Apart from the paradigm, I hope that Inko will
eventually have three big benefits over Erlang:<p>1. A better garbage collector, which translates to shorter pause timings, better
use of memory, etc.<p>2. A JIT. Inko doesn&#x27;t have one at the moment, but it will have one eventually.
How long this takes I don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;m not comfortable using LLVM as its GC
support is spotty (at least last I checked it was pretty much still a
nightmare), it breaks APIs every release, and every Linux distribution ships
a different (incompatible) version.<p>I&#x27;m hoping somebody writes a somewhat decent JIT library in Rust that I can use,
but so far there have only been basic building blocks made such as
<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;crates.io&#x2F;crates&#x2F;dynasm"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;crates.io&#x2F;crates&#x2F;dynasm</a>.<p>For Erlang there have been various attempts at writing a JIT, but I believe
none of those ever made it to a production state.<p>3. Inko will be simpler. It&#x27;s error handling model means you don&#x27;t have to
monitor processes, as they can&#x27;t crash unexpectedly (unless there is a bug,
which you shouldn&#x27;t handle at runtime). Combined with the gradual typing
aspect I can see Inko being much less frustrating to use, be it for a small
prototype or a large application.",2018-08-07 11:57:03,17705645

Most of the team works from our office in South Africa. However, 4 months ago I moved to Singapore for work &#x2F; personal reasons. I used to be quite averse to the idea of remote workers, but seeing as just about everyone will now be remote from my perspective, I decided it&#x27;s a good time to start focusing on hiring for remote work. Weve hired 3 remote developers so far and its been a great experience!<p>SimplePay is online payroll software for South Africa, Ireland, Singapore and Hong Kong. Our software lets thousands of small business owners (and their accountants) run their payrolls without headaches, so they can focus on the challenge of building their businesses.<p>Do you believe most SPAs are a pile of steaming crap, but wouldn&#x27;t mind digging into Vue.js for pages that will benefit from the increased interactivity? Do you laugh when people give up the power of PostgreSQL in favour of data stores that don&#x27;t offer any benefits for their use case? If so, you may fit in well with our mindset.
The work will include: Doing direct integrations with banks that offer good APIs; Expanding our API for other systems to integrate with us; Adding new features; Optimising for performance; Integrating with government systems; Squashing bugs; Eventually, the opportunity to do some mobile development (probably using Flutter).<p>Experience: Due to our full pipeline, we can only hire developers who have a few years of Rails experience at this time, or polyglots who at least know Ruby. Previous experience with remote work would be a bonus - we need people who understand the challenges and can share what they&#x27;ve learnt.<p>Location: Most of the team is in GMT+2, and I&#x27;ll be in GMT+8 going forward. So anything from GMT+0 to GMT+8 should be OK, unless you keep unusual working hours. We are a registered employer in South Africa and Singapore, so it would be hassle-free if you&#x27;re based in those countries.

Mozilla is that company in my mind -- remember the time when they made a whole mobile operating system based on it, and at the same time tried to push forwards for various parts along (WebBluetooth, other APIs)? That&#x27;s what investing in the web as a platform looks like.

1522,"It&#x27;s similar, but not the same. The details matter. They&#x27;re different because you don&#x27;t need to deal with a complex abstraction layer to share logic. As in, you can expose an iOS Framework and call it from swift&#x2F;Objc just like any other library. That lets you share tested logic and architecture, and do so optionally. It&#x27;s not all-or-nothing. Xamarin is a different approach. Flutter is a very different approach.<p>Part of the issue when evaluating frameworks is expectations and not understand the plusses&#x2F;minuses. If you are looking for a framework that will do 1 codebase for all logic and UI, without sacrificing any UX or capabilities, you&#x27;ll probably be let down. Kotlin Multiplatform will be great for sharing logic and architecture. UI is somewhat of a different case. Why Xamarin wasn&#x27;t great here is you need to do EVERYTHING in Xamarin, and write custom bridge code when not. It&#x27;s an entirely different world, which bad IDE support for most of it&#x27;s history. Jetbrains makes excellent tools, and if you understand that the UI will be &quot;native&quot;, then there&#x27;s a lot of efficiencies you can leverage here.

I used to be quite averse to the idea of remote workers, but seeing as just about everyone will now be remote from my perspective, I decided it&#x27;s a good time to start focusing on hiring for remote work. Weve hired 3 remote developers so far and its been a great experience!<p>SimplePay is online payroll software for South Africa, Ireland, Singapore and Hong Kong. Our software lets thousands of small business owners (and their accountants) run their payrolls without headaches, so they can focus on the challenge of building their businesses.<p>Do you believe most SPAs are a pile of steaming crap, but wouldn&#x27;t mind digging into Vue.js for pages that will benefit from the increased interactivity? Do you laugh when people give up the power of PostgreSQL in favour of data stores that don&#x27;t offer any benefits for their use case? If so, you may fit in well with our mindset. The work will include: Doing direct integrations with banks that offer good APIs; Expanding our API for other systems to integrate with us; Adding new features; Optimising for performance; Integrating with government systems; Squashing bugs; Eventually, the opportunity to do some mobile development (maybe using Flutter).<p>Experience: Due to our full pipeline, we can only hire developers who have a few years of Rails experience at this time, or polyglots who at least know Ruby. Previous experience with remote work would be a bonus - we need people who understand the challenges and can share what they&#x27;ve learnt.<p>Location: Most of the team is in GMT+2, and I&#x27;ll be in GMT+8 going forward. So anything from GMT+0 to GMT+8 should be OK, unless you keep unusual working hours.<p>Please mail careers@simplepay.co.za and put &quot;Hacker News&quot; somewhere in the subject.

The only thing I can come up with is &quot;continue gathering data to build experiences which enable them to sell ads and continue to gather more data&quot;, which feels reductive and has almost nothing to do with hardware.<p>The Pixel has always, in a broader market sense, been a bit of a non-starter. Its a fine device, don&#x27;t get me wrong, but they sold 3.7M in 2017 [1]. Compare that to ~220M iPhones [2] or ~30M Samsung devices [2]. Its not even close. No one looks at LG&#x27;s phone business and thinks its healthy, but that&#x27;s the magnitude of sales we&#x27;re talking about.<p>And their disastrous attempts at &quot;premium&quot; ChromeOS hardware. The Pixelbook was the most hilariously horrible device Google has ever made (wait... maybe that should go to the Pixel C?). The Slate looks a lot better, but where&#x27;s the value compared to the cheaper Surface Pro 6 or iPad Pro? ChromeOS is an amazing platform for your grandma, but that doesn&#x27;t sell units. And how does ChromeOS further Google&#x27;s broader ecosystem goals? I use G-Suite personally and I feel no draw to buy one of these things, and I should be their target market.<p>If they&#x27;re trying to take back more control of the Android market, they&#x27;re failing. So, they&#x27;ve got the web. The &quot;open web&quot; isn&#x27;t even a strategic moat for them; its the minimum price for them to exist.

It&#x27;s really great if you let it handle most things, maybe you buy a theme or maybe something bigger to put on top, but generally you let Sharepoint handle most things on your intranet. You&#x27;ll include a few non-Microsoft systems through Sharepoint apps or widgets, and that still works well enough. That&#x27;s the great use case. The terrible use case, is using it alongside 500 other IT systems and trying to include those, the way you&#x27;d like a modern enterprise intranet to do.<p>We have a system to report our driving to get it refunded. Another system to get vacation time accepted and validated, and a third system for sick leave. All with their own web-interfaces, mobile apps and open APIs. They rely on AD and ADFS for authentication, but they&#x27;re their own things. Sure you can build a Sharepoint specific plugin for each of them, but a modern intranet should really support stuff like VUE stand alone widgets&#x2F;apps so that you can share those widgets between systems and you really can&#x27;t do that with a Sharepoint plugin.<p>We use Azure a lot, like I said, and it I think it&#x27;s great, but it&#x27;s very clear that .NET is very first class in Azure. You can argue that stuff like Node.js is up there, and maybe the few python frameworks that Microsoft support with visual studio, but JAVA, Go, Flutter or whatever you can think of certainly isn&#x27;t smooth in Azure.<p>And just try using non-outlook, libra office or something other than one drive for business in your Microsoft enterprise setup, you can, but it&#x27;s not very nice.<p>I&#x27;m sounding negative, but I actually really like Microsoft.

1643,"You&#x27;re right -- No one should have to learn React! I&#x27;m personally not even a React fan. However standards-driven web components[0] are progressing rather slowly (as they should be, arguably), so frameworks like React&#x2F;Vue&#x2F;Polymer&#x2F;Mithril exist to get you some of that goodness faster than is otherwise possible in a cross-platform way.<p>My more subtle point was that HTML and CSS despite all their warts have solved these problems -- I&#x27;ve expressed the sentiment here before -- design languages with their use of XML or more constricted DSLs or whatever else are just subsets of HTML + CSS, except I never find that they&#x27;re engineered to minimize conceptual reuse. Both platforms make their own thing, claim it&#x27;s good&#x2F;the best from their own rooftop, and call it a day, expecting app developers to join the cult. I don&#x27;t like that, and I know it makes me a worse mobile developer (I sacrifice the ability to relatively immediately solve some <i>really</i> deep UI layout bug in the native platform), but I&#x27;d gladly be able to write &quot;good enough&quot; cross platform apps two times quicker than being able to right a top performing&#x2F;fully native optimized application two times quicker.

Make your own subset and make your own choices, but don&#x27;t re-solve problems HTML and CSS have already solved. For example, take the structural layout concepts from CSS Flexbox but maybe throw out the cascading if you want.<p>BTW, I think Flutter is a trojan horse that&#x27;s going to very likely be successful. Google was crazy enough to draw every pixel, then start building combinatorically from there. Right now it &quot;embeds&quot; in Android and iOS and also Fuscia (!!). Eventually It&#x27;ll get a QT embed (because Google can afford to throw devs at it, just like they threw devs at the ridiculous-on-its-face &quot;draw every pixel&quot; approach), and whatever else and might actually be the first thing to be usable for all platforms without much worry.<p>From what I understand JavaFX is one of the only similar UI frameworks to Flutter in application land and people who use it seem to love it.<p>[0]: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;docs&#x2F;Web&#x2F;Web_Components"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;docs&#x2F;Web&#x2F;Web_Components</a>",2018-10-15 05:25:16,18217542
1644,"I think there are some morals in the Odyssey. For example, the assembly at Ithaca in book 2 provides some insight into justice in ancient Greece. Telemachus appears to escalate through three authorities. First, is his own strength, second is the people of Ithaca:<p><pre><code>  Now we have no man like Odysseus in command
  to drive this curse from the house. We ourselves?
  Were hardly the ones to fight them off. All wed do
  is parade our wretched weakness. A boy inept at battle.
  Oh Id swing to attach if I had the power in me.
  By god, its intolerable, what they dodisgrace,
  my house a shambles! You should be ashamed yourselves,
  mortified in the face of neighbors living round about!
  Fear the gods wrathbefore they wheel in outrage
  and make these crimes recoil on your heads. (2.57-67)
</code></pre>
And when the towns people refuse to do anything, Telemachus escalates to the third authoritythe gods:<p><pre><code>  But if you decide the fare is better, richer here,
  destroying one mans goods and going scot-free,
  all right then, carve away!
  But Ill cry out to the everlasting gods in hopes
  that Zeus will pay you back with a vengeanceall of you
  destroyed in my house while I go scot-free myself! (2.1415)
</code></pre>
It seems that fear of the gods was the main source of justice in Greek society. Since there were no contracts or court system to build trust between individuals, people relied on oathsand the fear of the gods if one broke their oathto build trust. Similarly, if one could not find justice through strength of your fellow men, you could threaten the wrongdoers with a curse. If they feared the gods, they make respond.<p>In such a society an atheist or godless person could not be trusted. Right after Telemachus threatens the suitors with a curse, Zeus sends a sign down in the form of two eagles. One of the old townsmen, who excelled in reading omens and bird signs, said that the eagles were a sign from Zeus that the suitors would get what is coming to them. And the suitors respond:<p><pre><code>  Stop, old man!
  Eurymachus, Polybus son, rose up to take him on.
  Go home and babble your omens to your children
  save them from some catastrophe coming soon.
  Im a better hand than you at reading portents.
  Flocks of birds go fluttering under the suns rays,
  not all are fraught with meaning. (2.17783)
</code></pre>
To the Greeks that read this, I think the Odyssey would be affirmation that the gods did exist and that the suitors were in the wrong. Perhaps this could be interpreted as a moral lesson?<p>(Quotes are taken from the excellent Robert Fagles translation)",2018-10-16 14:51:53,18229831
1645,"&gt; Flexbox was proposed in 2009, and it hasn&#x27;t been widely available until years after that. The iOS and Android layout systems are functionally older than the &quot;good&quot; parts of CSS you speak of (I would agree FlexBox and Grid are actually fine, although not as complete of a solution as constraint-based layouts).<p>And when was AutoLayout introduced? Even with that, it&#x27;s evolved and been improved over time -- I bet you wouldn&#x27;t want to use AutoLayout from 2016 today if you could avoid it. Either way, Apple could have introduced AutoLayout as a private extension of CSS that doesn&#x27;t worry about being spec-compliant, without completely rebuilding their own framework for styling.<p>Are you implying the android layout systems are older than CSS itself? Because one of the &quot;good&quot; parts of CSS I was talking about was <i>basic</i> targeting and separation of concerns between styling and layout. That&#x27;s fundamental CSS, and long predates any mobile platforms.<p>People writing mobile apps, <i>especiallly</i> native ones don&#x27;t give a shit about cross-platform <i>anything</i>, I don&#x27;t understand why you&#x27;d all of a sudden start worrying about that if you used CSS. I keep repeating this, but they can make their own private subset of the CSS spec that only their developers have to care about.<p>You&#x27;ve framed the burden of cross-platform support as a bad thing, but it&#x27;s a good thing -- whatever that cost is, you pay it once, for <i>everyone</i> -- you prefer a world where cross-platform support is just impossible?<p>&gt; If that seems like jargon to you, I would have the suspicion that you have never put the time in to learn the basic auto-layout concepts. If that&#x27;s the case I&#x27;m not sure how you can compare them.<p>This a common mindset that I&#x27;ve never agreed with. If you can&#x27;t explain the simplest uses of your abstraction without a sentence full of jargon, this is a red flag for me, it&#x27;s a shitty abstraction. Jargon is calcified complexity that is so burdensome to try and explain&#x2F;analogize that you just pick a word and say it instead. This is like what people say who build ridiculous Java class&#x2F;pattern riddled sand castles all day, then say that if I don&#x27;t understand why they needed a AbstractThingFactoryMakerService then I didn&#x27;t learn the basics.<p>This is precisely why I will never willingly enter the quagmire that is fully native development, there are people like you in the wild waiting to justify any bad design decision the native platform makes once they&#x27;ve paid the cost of learning a subpar abstraction&#x2F;re-engineering of a mostly solved problem that&#x27;s been foisted upon them.

1651,"React Native very much took things by storm when it came out and as it gained popularity very much supplanting previously leading hybrid mobile development solutions like Phonegap, Ionic, Xamarin, etc. It is currently the top cross platform development option but not everything seems to be going smoothly for it. As of late it would seem that there is a shift going on towards Google&#x27;s Flutter and even previously big React Native backers like Airbnb and Udacity have turned their back on React Native opting instead to go with native solutions while others deciding to go with Flutter (For example: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;reflectly-engineering&#x2F;reflectly-from-react-native-to-flutter-2e3dffced2ea)<p>The React Native development team seems to have planned a re-architecture of it as an answer to the issues these groups have found and which lead them to turn away from it.<p>One big pain point for React Native seems to be the so called &quot;dependency hell&quot;, where every project has to rely on a plethora of third party npm dependencies which constantly break even with the smallest updates.

Several posts in the React Native subreddit have expressed frustration over these issues. From what I gather Flutter does not suffers from this particular problem and it&#x27;s setup&#x2F;tooling is rather painless. And in term of app performance Flutter appears to do better as it doesn&#x27;t relies on a javascript bridge like React Native does (which seems to be the reason for slow performance at times).<p>Could all these be signs that it is the beginning of the end (so to speak) for React Native as the &quot;latest and greatest&quot; and could Flutter end up supplanting it as the framework of choice to develop for both platforms?",2018-10-21 12:49:22,18267764

Serverless and edge environments want to be able to have code running in a persistent process that is completely managed by the environment. Right now, they frequently offer just JS, or a couple of language runtime environments like Python as well; for serverless environments, you can generally load native modules if you want to, but its awkward, while edge environments will only run JS, though now they&#x27;re starting to offer WASM.<p>It&#x27;s the places where being able to run multiple tenants within a single process, without paying IPC and process isolation overheads, that make the overhead of WASM more likely to be worth it.<p>&gt; On mobile this seems to depend on Apple and&#x2F;or Google deciding to support WebAssembly for native apps, which seems unlikely.<p>I don&#x27;t think it would be too unlikely for Google to support WASM for native apps.

1665,"&gt;How do you think FB and other popular content consuming apps work nowadays?<p>Majority of the content on these apps is native and not html&#x2F;js. They have a small amount of content on the settings screens in html&#x2F;js but all of the main view code is native. For an app with complex layouts and content like facebook, html&#x2F;js scroll performance would be far too slow.  You can easily verify this by running the application with UIAutomator turned on which will show you the widgets being used on screen.<p>Native is faster because it&#x27;s not layout and control agnostic. So you get controls like recyclerview which recycle view elements while scrolling large lists to keep animations smoooth. Sure, you can implement that in javascript too, but the javascript can&#x27;t beat a native c++ implementation which is also GPU accelerated. This is also the reason why frameworks like React Native and Flutter were born. They use javascript&#x2F;dart but render all UI content natively which allows them to maintain smooth 60fps animations.<p>To be honest, I wouldn&#x27;t like mobile going the html&#x2F;js way at all. Html&#x2F;js has moved to desktop with electron and the results aren&#x27;t that great. They take up huge amounts of memory ( gmail web on chrome takes up 500mb of ram on my machine, also slack is a noteworthy mention). Native desktop apps take up a fraction of that memory. For the sake of accessibility we have significantly sacrificed performance. I can&#x27;t wait for webassembly to be widely adopted so that the browser can move away from html&#x2F;js. Google has a nifty tool called ArcWelder which allows android apps to run in chrome. Apple has already announced support for running iOS apps on Mac. Would people really want to use html&#x2F;js apps if they have native and more performant apps available on their platform?",2018-11-05 14:26:15,18382483

It&#x27;s an MVP with basic database backups in place, using Docker to deploy the app. It just works.<p>Lessons for me from this:<p>* Server-side template rendering is perfectly fine and actually easier, frankly
* JS can still be used client-side to improve the experience without replacing the above or making the entire rendering process client-side
* Although Go compiles to a single static binary I still need other assets, so it went into a Docker container for the added security benefits not to mention portability
* Serverless is nice, but unless it&#x27;s replaced the above day-to-day, there&#x27;s always a steep learning curve around something you haven&#x27;t done with it yet, but need

Each of these out-of-core dependencies can have separate lifecycles, which makes it a lot easier for them to be developed and updated, making them higher quality. If breaking changes need to be made, that can easily be done in out-of-core libraries, since existing projects can continue depending on their SemVer-defined compatible version of the dependency ad infinitum, and the project maintainers can continue releasing updates to any SemVer series of the package if they need to backport changes to older versions. When something is in the core, it&#x27;s very hard to update it while maintaining complete compatibility, and people can only depend on one version of your core library at a time, so there&#x27;s no room to be flexible. This constricts growth, since the core needs to meet <i>everyone&#x27;s</i> needs, but it doesn&#x27;t have the flexibility to do that as the world changes, so it often meets <i>no one&#x27;s</i> needs.<p>I don&#x27;t know how good Dart&#x27;s package manager is, since I haven&#x27;t really touched Dart since the very earliest days of the language after it became public, but Rust&#x27;s package manager is excellent, and having most things out-of-std has been great for the community. Futures and async have flourished out-of-std and gone through several very different approaches to gain real world experience.

1713,"Hey Tim. I can completely understand the reasoning behind it from a project development perspective, I&#x27;m just pointing out some of the pitfalls in doing it this way.<p>Obviously I don&#x27;t know how you&#x27;ve structured responsibilities internally, but what I&#x27;ve seen before is, that the quality of individual components, or plugins if you will, live and die by the interest of the teams and people behind them.<p>Qt has this very same problem, often leading to some bugs ageing unacceptably long, or features never properly maturing, simply because there&#x27;s little to no inside interest.

Coincidentally, I was lucky enough to catch a quick chat with Michael Thomsen, after his talk at Coldfront recently and he mentioned that, that was indeed on the roadmap.

1716,"I&#x27;m a backend developer; so not much stake in this game. But honest question: why does this need a relatively unknown and unloved language, i.e. Dart?

So what is up with Dart, aka yet another language not quite unlike swift, java, javascript, c# and indeed kotlin? They&#x27;ve been pushing Dart for nearly a decade and I&#x27;ve yet to meet a single developer specializing in it. I more or less considered this completely dead, obsolete, irrelevant, and forgotten until Google started talking about this flutter thing.<p>Why is this language needed at all? What&#x27;s so good about this flutter thing that it could not possibly be done with other languages (i.e. Kotlin) but must have its own language (and associated tools, and other cruft).<p>I mean, I look at this and think: when is Google going to walk away from this one (again)? Or did they already and just not bother to inform the poor people behind it. It sort of fits in a long line of Google abandon ware.

How many programs are using Kotlin&#x2F;Native?<p>Which isn&#x27;t a knock on those projects. Like Flutter, they&#x27;re all relatively new endeavors using fairly new languages.

1718,"BTW, for those looking for another option other than Flutter and React Native, check out NativeScript[0], or Nativescript-Vue[1].<p>Nativescript is different from react native because it includes a native call translation layer -- you can write JS that actually uses native runtime objects. It&#x27;s also got excellent support for cross platform applications that reach down to native on both platforms, and can meld right in with a fully native app as well, and is thoroughly F&#x2F;OSS (they take the marketplace approach to monetization).<p>Nativescript different from Flutter in that it has nothing to do with the tirefire that is Dart. Nativescript is OSS and is taking the marketplace approach to capitalizing and recently they got Hot Module Reloading as a result of integrating more closely with webpack&#x2F;other capable bundlers.<p>I&#x27;ve recently done projects (one larger client app, another a small personal project) in both and kept some notes on what I liked about Nativescript vs Flutter (I&#x27;m pretty biased for Nativescript now), not sure if I&#x27;ll make a blog post about it but here are some hopefully interesting points:<p>- Performance tradeoffs are roughly the same for dart vs nativescript, do hard work in an isolate (dart) or webworker(nativescript)<p>- Flutter&#x27;s reactivity is 10x more tedious than Nativescript-Vue. Making an entire other class and doing all these overrides for what should be a basic feature is pretty ridiculous, though everyone&#x27;s fine with it because they just right click in their $IDE.<p>- Flutter&#x27;s data management is not great -- everything they&#x27;ve made so far seems like a hack. I&#x27;m uncomfortable with the build function being on the state object conceptually, InheritedWidgets are just using context as a grab-bag, the BLoC pattern is so complicated.<p>- State&lt;MyPage&gt; &amp; StatefulWidget being separate classes and the State&lt;MyPage&gt; having the build function unsettles me. I don&#x27;t know if it had to be this way because of dart 2&#x27;s type system (which is subpar in my experience, Typescript is better because it at least offers duck-typed interfaces)<p>- Dart is terrible. It is a modern language yet it lacks almost none of the advances of modern languages, Dart 2 was a near rewrite and it it still manages to be less compelling than Typescript, and nowhere near languages like Go, Rust, Crystal, etc. I am kind of suspicious google is pushing this language just because they invented it and can control it -- I don&#x27;t know a single redeeming quality of dart, especially if you consider dart 1 before you consider dart 2.<p>- Flutter subtly forces you into either Material Design or Cupertino -- this surprised me. Flutter subtly pushes you towards material design, which I have no interest in, and I think most people actually trying to create unique app experiences wouldn&#x27;t either. This is a double edged sword, in Nativescript you have to seek out native-looking components, but in Flutter they&#x27;re forced upon you especially at the beginning, and I prefer the former.<p>- Automatic sending of crash logs to Google -- who thought this was a good idea? And to make it opt-out instead of opt-in?<p>- Flutter probably has the better longer term viability because it&#x27;s being embedded into Fuschia and other things google is doing.<p>- I expect Nativescript to eventually take on WASM and <i>really</i> open up the choices for languages to use with it.<p>[0]: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.nativescript.org"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.nativescript.org</a><p>[1]: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nativescript-vue.org&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nativescript-vue.org&#x2F;</a>",2018-11-24 01:23:40,18519890

1728,"tl;dr - Progress (the company that sponsors Nativescript) doesn&#x27;t the market&#x2F;advertising dollars compared to Facebook&#x2F;React, and Google&#x2F;Flutter or MS&#x2F;Xamarin.<p>Well I think the biggest difference is purchasing power of the companies behind those other solutions in terms of marketing. Flutter has gotten this the most right, so far -- they make very published developer resources, and market aggressively, they have things like the Flutter Development Show[0], and little 30 second clips introducing parts of the platform[1] . It&#x27;s a good thing (they&#x27;re innovating in the documentation&#x2F;dev experience space), but taken cynically it&#x27;s just a marketing ploy.<p>I hate to say it, but lately people have been applying the same advertising and marketing logic they use on consumers on developers rather than necessarily making the best product they can and letting word spread organically. It&#x27;s a bit of a chicken and egg problem -- you usually can only build the best product with help from others, which means getting in front of them, but usually you want to make a good thing <i>so you can</i> justify getting in front of the developers in the first place... So people put out shitty tools, then just iterate <i>after</i> the community shows up and finds out there are lots of rough edges (see: mongo, react, dart, etc).<p>The last I&#x27;ll say on the subject is that &quot;developer evangelists&quot; are basically paid marketers&#x2F;advertisers.<p>Nativescript also has this thing where it was popular <i>years</i> ago, but has recently seen a surge in popularity -- you have projects like nativescript-exit[2] (which provides a cross platform way to exit the app from JS) that have code from 2 years ago. This is actually a really great point for nativescript, because solidly written plugins like nativescript-exit really are solid -- I very recently used it in a project and it <i>just worked</i>. The integration points available in Nativescript have a <i>very</i> high potential (not to say other platforms don&#x27;t).<p>[0]: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;playlist?list=PLOU2XLYxmsIK0r_D-zWcmJ1plIcDNnRkK"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;playlist?list=PLOU2XLYxmsIK0r_D-zWcm...</a><p>[1]: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=R9C5KMJKluE"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=R9C5KMJKluE</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dvabuzyarov&#x2F;nativescript-exit"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dvabuzyarov&#x2F;nativescript-exit</a>",2018-11-24 05:32:10,18520625

1742,"Co-creator of Selenum 1.0 checking in. My part of the 2004 Selenium was the wire protocol that allowed one process (the Java&#x2F;Ruby&#x2F;C#&#x2F;Python test runner) to control the other (the browser). In so doing implemented a rudimentary COMET protocol, as it happens.<p>Anyway, FlutterDriver is pretty frickin limited. Its like Selenium-RC without the XPath. Thank Turing that Simon Stewart and WebDriver came along and did a reverse takeover of Selenium. Selenium on my MacBookAir for perfected build toolchains can zip along at 3-5 tests as second with the browser open and you being able to roughly see what it is doing. Not 3-5 clicks a second, 3-5 tests a second.<p>FlutterDriver, by contrast is 5x slower. And even then that&#x27;s only after the APK has been shoved into the emulator which can be minutes on my MBA. It <i></i>feels<i></i> to me like the FlutterDriver tests are being added to the APK being sent to the emulator, and then phoning home with minimal output of the run (not withstanding the ability to attach a debugger). There&#x27;s no doubt that the better solution would be to open a socket to the host OS&#x27;s test-runner process and chat back and forth about direction of the testing. If needs be, that shitty Selenium-RC COMETalike way , but there&#x27;s no reason a whole bunch of telemetry couldn&#x27;t be traded too if a BEEPlike protocol were developed. And the running process shouldn&#x27;t be constrained to Dart. Some teams will want their test runner logic in another 3GL like Python.<p>Then there&#x27;s the lack of reflection. I may agree that production apps may want to explicitly turn off reflection in order to be more efficient. But for test-automation purposes it is great (e.g. Gherkin), and it would be nice of there were some effort to publish patterns and set policy that would allow that way of working to be lasting.<p>Also, Apple are way ahead with a simulator for iOS and the XCode toolchain that&#x27;s so much faster for testing considerations.

1745,"Back to where this started:
&quot;is there any feature of Dart that is required by Flutter?&quot;<p>This is me paraphrasing why the Flutter team think Dart is a good fit:<p>It&#x27;s a familiar language for developers who have written JS, Java, C#, or C++. It has types to allow working on large codebases, and efficient AOT compilation. It has tooling for popular IDEs. Does subsecond hot-reload on iOS and Android (also more than just method bodies). It&#x27;s performance, even on iOS dev mode is sufficient to do all of the layout and widget code. It&#x27;s open source under liberal license which allows you to embed it your app.<p>Your claim:
&quot;There are plenty of programming languages that offer these applicabilities.&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t think this is true. Even if you want to count Eiffel that&#x27;s one, not plenty.<p>Nor could Eiffel have been used for Flutter since the GPL means you can&#x27;t embed the VM in your app. Nor is it particular familiar for developers of existing mainstream languages.<p>Anyways, I agree that there&#x27;s nothing &quot;special snowflakey&quot; about any of this technology, but no-one else, that I&#x27;m aware of, is shipping a language and toolchain that ticks all of these boxes at the moment. Hopefully someone will build this stuff for other popular stacks too.<p>(I am also aware of Eiffel. I remember hearing about it at uni back in the mid-90s when discussing CBD. I think it may be older than mid-90s too. I also don&#x27;t think it would have been a very good choice for Flutter.)<p>Also what&#x27;s with this whole &quot;Dart struggling for survival&quot; meme of yours. It comes off as kinda unhinged.

1753,"Sorry for the delay in response, I didn&#x27;t see this. I think the problem is kind of endemic -- it&#x27;s kind of like all the documentation and everything always <i>starts</i> from a Material component. Like if you look at provided scaffolds and you see CupertinoScaffold in the Widget Index[0], you might expect MaterialScaffold to be an option as well, but it&#x27;s just &quot;Scaffold&quot;. Little things like this indicate that you expect &quot;MaterialScaffold&quot; to be the default resting state. 99% of the time when I&#x27;m writing an app I have the design already and it may or may not be in material style or Cupertino style -- I personally would expect a framework to offer general tools first then the specializations. There are a bunch of other example of components that only really work correctly in the Material context. It&#x27;s not a <i>huge</i> thing, and Google <i>does</i> have a pony in the race (which makes it easier for me to tinfoilhat about it), you have every right to push material as the default&#x2F;make it easier to work with -- but I enjoy not having any such bias with Nativescript, even if it costs me slightly more work to get components that are stylistically coherent with either paradigm.<p>From an engineering standpoint I absolutely understand the automatic crash logging, it&#x27;s good that you&#x27;re able to get the user data. I think you guys are just fine as I&#x27;m more tinfoil-hatty than 99% of the usual developer will ever be -- the average developer won&#x27;t care. I don&#x27;t know realistically how it could be improved without sacrificing that useful data, but maybe a notice @ install time? I just never saw any mention (I read through the docs, watched lots of video), and was surprised -- maybe the negative impression was amplified because I was having issues with flutter at the time.

system where its very common to allocate thousands of objects in a  if not, tens of thousands
of objects in a single frame.<p>&gt; In a span of a few milliseconds and then immediately let go of those objects again. Theres a
variety of ways to do that but Dart, having a generational garbage collector, can handle large
volumes of short lived objects very quickly. Dart also has some really nice performance
characteristics, it has an ahead of time compiled back end which allows us to compile straight to
native arm code, allow us to achieve really fast startup on really consistent performance and
Dart also has a nice focus on developer experience which really got along well with my team.<p>From <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;softwareengineeringdaily.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;07&#x2F;09&#x2F;flutter-with-eric-seidel&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;softwareengineeringdaily.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;07&#x2F;09&#x2F;flutter-with...</a>",2018-12-04 21:01:39,18603567

The reactive UI model (not just Flutter, but all React-like frameworks) is an ongoing attempt to do a better job of all of it, with varying success. Existing UI toolkits, before the introduction of this model, were not designed for it. They were built on the assumption that the future would be a giant object graph caught in a tangle of callback methods. If you want to make a reactive UI populated by native widget objects, you have to figure out how to plumb all their mutable state back into the reactive model.

Branding themes are more prevelant on most apps people are using than not.<p>&gt;&gt; they dont get updates to native controls... e.g. if the OS adds some new drag-and-drop capability to text fields the framework doesnt get it unless and until the framework is updated (and the app is updated to use the newer version of the framework). Of course, some things are never deemed important enough to be adopted by the framework.<p>If people are writing cross-platform apps and want to use new platform-specific features, wouldn&#x27;t they have to write platform-specific code anyway if they were native? I&#x27;m not sure this is a newly introduced problem in any sense.<p>&gt;&gt; - Ambitious frameworks that really try to minimize the gaps between apps build with the framework vs native app grow to be very large. They take on the role of the entire app-facing OS API, which is truely massive in todays systems. This leads to slow-loading&#x2F;building, resource-hungry apps.

1887,"I&#x27;ve been following and using Flutter since release 0.2. I think Flutter is an amazing project. It makes writing concise and beautiful apps very easy. I&#x27;ve come to love Dart and the whole Flutter framework. I really think it is the best framework to write Android applications. It also works great for iOS were you can either choose to use Material or Cupertino components. It is a huge improvement over the old Android SDK; which is quite outdated in my opinion. It&#x27;s too hard to create a beautiful app with the current Android SDK. To many hurdless. Flutter feels like what developing an Android app should be like today.
Another thing about Flutter is that it&#x27;s also ready to work with Google&#x27;s (upcoming; maybe) Fuchsia OS.

1899,"&gt;... but I feel these are not really issues in practice (only in theory).<p>Ha, I wish! I&#x27;ve been down this road a few times and this list came from contemplating some of my old battle scars.<p>&gt; ...as `coldtea` points out below, this is not really an issue in today&#x27;s ecosystem.<p>That&#x27;s not quite the same thing as it not being a problem. I know it can be done, but it&#x27;s <i>harder</i> than when using native controls. This is something the &quot;big dogs&quot; can handle (they can bring massive resources to high-profile projects if need be) -- especially if they control the framework.<p>&gt; ...cases where code-heavy app sizes have actually hindered app downloads...
Well, look around for people complaining about bloat. It&#x27;s not usually the download itself, by the way. Memory is filled and runtimes have to initialize, buffers allocated, etc. It all takes time and uses runtime resources. This is fine to a point, but once you use too many resources or take too much time, it has a negative impact on the app (and as the developer, you have to deal with it in some way... e.g., perhaps spend time to alleviate the issues or perhaps walk away from lower-end devices). Any app, no matter the tech used to develop it can face these issues as it grows. But with an engine you start off closer to the limits and have less control over resource usage, so you generally reach them more quickly.<p>&gt; Flutter renders all of its fonts itself natively, using the same way Chrome does it. Has this been a problem?<p>Hey, if flutter solves cross-platform text in 1.0 as you suggest, then good for them. Believe me, that&#x27;s a massive accomplishment. (Though I&#x27;ll note: if they aren&#x27;t using native facilities, they&#x27;ll have to duplicate them, which goes back to the point on bloat.)<p>&gt; Is this a remark on an incomplete cross platform framework...?
No, I&#x27;m saying apps -- at some point -- generally eventually need to incorporate third-party libraries&#x2F;tools to best accomplish their purpose. A PDF generator, a .csv parser, an image processor, an AI library, whatever. (A framework can&#x27;t include an API for everything and shouldn&#x27;t try, so it&#x27;s not a matter of an incomplete framework). However whatever third-partly library you&#x27;re interested in probably won&#x27;t provide direct support for your framework, so you&#x27;ll have to figure it out and do it yourself. It really depends on the library and the framework and how&#x2F;whether they overlap how much harder this is.<p>E.g., suppose you want to incorporate an image rendering library of some sort into your app. The library supports iOS and Android and can output to UIImage on iOS and Bitmap on Android and their site provides samples showing how each of these work. But you&#x27;re using a framework that has &quot;XImage&quot; and &quot;XImageView&quot;. So now you need to delve into the platform&#x27;s &quot;XImage&quot; to figure out how to load a UIImage into it on iOS and a Bitmap on Android. Maybe you find it works in terms of OpenGL textures and you realize going through a UIImage&#x2F;Bitmap is an extra, inefficient step, so now you&#x27;re learning about how to load directly from the library output into an OpenGL texture and you learn OpenGL textures can have different color formats so you start using the complicated low-level API of the image library to get output in the color format of the OpenGL texture. Whew! What would have been a few lines of code in each native app turned into a couple days of work, but you&#x27;re done and release it.... and shortly thereafter, you start getting reports that the images are flipped on certain devices. Uh Oh... Now, maybe flutter doesn&#x27;t have this particular problem, but this is just an example. This <i>kind</i> of thing will pop up as you integrate the third-party libraries you use with the UI platform. The more &quot;opinionated&quot; the UI platform is, the more quickly you&#x27;ll run into these kinds of problems.<p>&gt; This feels like an emotional assessment of having to learn something new.
Oh, come on. I&#x27;m pointing out an additional cost to adopting this kind of platform. That&#x27;s a real concern to anyone developing apps, not something you can dismiss as an &quot;emotional assessment&quot; (Not sure even what that means -- laziness?). Note, this is an <i>additional</i> cost since you&#x27;ll need native expertise in any case.",2018-12-05 16:28:28,18609721

1951,"Don&#x27;t throw away the old unreadable tapes, I&#x27;m sure they can be read other ways.
Long ago I built an interface to the 1531 to allow tape duplication via my external Aiwa tape deck. I tapped the signal somewhere near the output of the device, sent it through some TTL gates to make its shape more squarish, then it went through a voltage divider into the deck input. Results were astonishing: I didn&#x27;t have any tool at hand to condition the signal, but merely making it more loud and clean did wonders; no more hours spent adjusting the head azimuth. To be clear, a cassette which required adjustment could turn into a perfectly readable copy if recorded <i>without</i> adjusting the azimuth. In other words the problem wasn&#x27;t the azimuth but low signal level (which is <i>also</i> a product of bad head alignment).<p>Now back to those old cassettes. If saving them from one device to another or sampling and filtering them doesn&#x27;t work, it may just be the poor 1531 that cannot cope with a signal too much dirty because it lacks the brains to recognize it, but our eyes could indeed spot the problem. No kidding, In the old days I spent hours for every single music track cleaning them from vinyl scratches by zooming the waveform in Cool Edit Pro until I could see every single sample. Scratches became clearly visible for having a very different shape, often a few samples at a level not compatible with normal music. With time I learnt to spot them even more easily, and after finding them and verifying that they were actual scratches, I spent even hours for a single track cleaning them by reshaping the waveform, by hand, one sample at a time.
The reason behind this was Cool Edit&#x27;s vinyl cleaning algorithm which at the time sounded like garbage.<p>Cleaning digital data should be much easier: one can load the waveform into an editor then zoom it until the signal becomes visible. It doesn&#x27;t have to be readable by a 35 years old 1531, but merely recognizable by a human. Then either correct it manually (slow!), or write some macros to put x 1 or 0 samples where the mouse is according to a keypress. Then one can scroll the wave to a point where it starts an unknown bit; we know both data speed and carriers speed, therefore we know how many samples a bit is made of, this way when an unknown bit is met we know what to search for and based on this interpretation press a key which turns that series of unreadable samples into a nice 0 or 1 of the right duration and frequency. Still slow, but doable.<p>Analyzing the waveform at single sample level would also make possible to correct wow and flutter: again, we know the carriers frequencies and tape speed, so we know for sure how much long a bit must be and apply corrections where necessary.<p>Also, it might be interesting to sample all tracks at the same time into a multitrack file just like the cassette was a single side media. The reason being if the tape got damaged at a point, we can analyze the other track as well (yes, it&#x27;s reversed but we&#x27;re aware) to see if recovering one of them can help to save the other one too just by comparing a probably very similar damage done to two signals, one of which hopefully is easier to recover.",2018-12-12 23:30:18,18668632

1954,"I am in a similar boat, going to try and kick off a side project during this xmas break. As others mentioned, you should probably consider reducing scope and picking one platform to MVP on. I was also planning on doing a multi-platform project, but after some thought, it felt like doing the MVP on mobile first would be best (for the project I have in mind, it felt like I could get more features, faster, into a mobile prototype. might be different for yours though).  So I think I am going to try out Flutter, for a few reasons.<p>1. I don&#x27;t like javascript.
2. It sounds like Flutter is working on adding web and desktop support, so it&#x27;s possible that after I am done with the mobile prototype, that might be ready.  
3. I am not much of a designer, so the fact that Flutter integrates easily with material components[1], feels like it will make it easier to get to a half-decent looking MVP.
4. I already know python, so don&#x27;t really need to worry about server side code if I need it.<p>Another thing to consider, is if I had just focused on building something, rather than evaluating a bunch of frameworks, I would probably be half-way to a prototype by now.  But because my project is more &#x27;side-project&#x27; than &#x27;startup idea&#x27;, part of the fun is just kicking around some of these languages and frameworks.

1956,"I came to the same conclusion (and I&#x27;m not a big company that can afford Qt), so I built my own. Before Flutter got a new team @ Google ~3 years back, it was a set of tools for building cross-platform apps with C++ shared libs. A few years ago, this is what many of the FAANG companies were doing with their apps. Then, React Native was released and (I guess) the management at Google decided to take a different tack.<p>I did some research and found that Dropbox open sourced their internal tool for building cross-platform mobile apps in C++.

Recently I checked out Flutter, with the 1.0 release i thought it&#x27;s worth to play around with it. The first thing i did, was installing their demo app on my iPhone they showed on the release event. Within seconds I noticed that there was something wrong.

1987,"That clears things up. I&#x27;m glad that my concerns were a misinterpretation.<p>I myself have been in your shoes in terms of not being able to communicate hard-earned lessons to those less experienced. I don&#x27;t have a remedy for that other than time. The problem is that if devs follow your advice at face value, they may not run into issues but they can&#x27;t internalize what they never ran into. Only after they&#x27;ve learned enough can you communicate by analogy in a way that&#x27;s meaningful. Another trap is that being an expert in one subject area is often dismissed in others which seems reasonable for those with singular depth of knowledge. I&#x27;ve encountered this with mobile dev where I had highly transferable desktop GUI experience to make mobile dev straight forward but until I demonstrated it others would have no clue. Also, the differences in languages tend to be mostly syntactic but some consider that you either know or don&#x27;t know a language.<p>Another thing that has helped greatly in my situation is pair programming in a small startup. I had already done some mobile &amp; web dev tutorials but pairing on production code fills in the details. It shows how much of what you already know is relevant. Eventually they also pick up better ways of doing things when you either build it a different way but best when you&#x27;re fixing an issue that was done a poor way.<p>This pattern has repeated enough that I&#x27;ve come to terms with it--any time I&#x27;m at a new startup, I give it 6mo-1yr for the team and management to fully figure it out.<p>&gt; That&#x27;s what I mean by &quot;missing opportunities to less experienced engineers&quot; : I might have the upper hand when it comes to tech vision and making good long term architecture decisions, but this isn&#x27;t nearly as immediately useful (or appealing to a business partner) as their ability to actually get dev shit done and code a product prototype over the week-end.<p>This is a key point, worth seeing from another perspective. Consider that delivering end-user visible features quickly is actually more valuable &#x27;in the present&#x27; and long term architecture is for later. We&#x27;ve gone through 4 products&#x2F;pivots in two years, having spent good architecture&#x2F;engineering on any product but the last would have been a waste (and we did spend it on the second one). Thing is, we never know which product is the last one. The cadence that&#x27;s been working out is that others develop new features on products and I pair with other devs sometimes building features but more often improving existing ones by extending them, refactoring them, or simply fixing bugs and making them more reliable&#x2F;performant. Retros and the occasional Lunch &amp; Learn to share with the extended team to round it out. The most important thing is that it&#x27;s all done without pointing fingers (or right&#x2F;wrong labels). Under the same circumstances I would likely behave similarly, so it&#x27;s best to think of everyone being on a similar path, just at different points. Having written this I think the biggest change was in myself having more patience and seeing more experience&#x2F;knowledge as just that to be shared and not any kind of superiority. [Less than perfect: I have been known to &#x27;go rogue&#x27; on specific issues (not recently) though it&#x27;s mostly worked out.]<p>Edit: Do play with a newer framework or two.

2008,"The rise of Flutter makes a lot of sense when you think about how mobile has evolved over the last 5 years.<p>The days of Instapaper and the like where you could build a really good app and sell it, are long since past. Nowadays I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s really possible to make money as an app startup. Your best bet is probably releasing a game and being the one-in-a-million that goes viral.<p>Other than that, apps are the purview of existing big companies, and those mostly are concerned with lowering costs (since margins on mobile are so thin). With that being the case, something like Flutter that gives you a fairly good cross-platform experience are going to thrive.<p>It&#x27;s sort of like Java in the enterprise. It doesn&#x27;t matter if it&#x27;s pleasant to use. There&#x27;s a clearpath towards success, it&#x27;s safe for cheaper developers to use and not screw things up to bad.

Weve hired 3 remote developers so far and its been a great experience!<p>SimplePay is online payroll software for South Africa, Ireland, Singapore and Hong Kong.

The work will include: Doing direct integrations with banks that offer good APIs; Expanding our API for other systems to integrate with us; Adding new features; Optimising for performance; Integrating with government systems; Squashing bugs; Eventually, the opportunity to do some mobile development (maybe using Flutter).<p>Experience: Due to our full pipeline, we can only hire developers who have a few years of Rails experience at this time, or polyglots who at least know Ruby.

Here&#x27;s the summary:<p>- I started publishing video tutorials and articles about Flutter around April last year.<p>- To date, I have ~3700 subscribers on YouTube, ~2200 followers on Medium and ~1500 on my mailing list. All growing steadily.<p>- I researched all major platforms and shortlisted Udemy and Teachable. I want my course to be paid upfront (don&#x27;t like the subscription model used by Pluralsight and Skillshare).<p>- My audience would like to see my course on Udemy (presumably as they already have an account there)<p>- Top courses on Flutter are all on Udemy and have a lot of enrolled students (15K for #1 course). These are made by established teachers that already have a big audience and many courses on Udemy.<p>- I&#x27;m confident my Flutter course can make it in the top 5 on Udemy<p>- I&#x27;m familiar with Udemy&#x27;s revenue split (97% with coupon codes, or 50% without)<p>- I&#x27;m familiar with Teachable&#x27;s pricing model (5% commission on basic plan, 0% on professional plan)
- I&#x27;m aware of Udemy&#x27;s lack of policing around privacy (Google: &quot;Why Udemy is Bad&quot;)<p>Benefits of Udemy:<p>- Visibility &amp; direct search traffic (people looking for Flutter will find my course)<p>- Many people already have an account with linked credit card (less friction)<p>Drawbacks of Udemy:<p>- No control over pricing model.

Given the 50% commission, actual profit per sale is quite low.<p>Benefits of Teachable:<p>- Self hosted. Can use a subdomain and more easily drive traffic from my website&#x2F;blog. This may be a smart move as I also move my Medium publication to Ghost in the coming months.<p>- Pricing control. I can charge more for my course and pay 5% commission or less.<p>- Advanced features (drip content etc.)<p>Drawbacks of Teachable:<p>- No direct search traffic from the platform. I have to drive traffic organically myself to my website and the course.<p>- People will have to register an account and add a credit card (more friction)<p>Closing thoughts<p>- As a new player in the market, I feel that Udemy is the safer choice.

2138,"<i>&gt; the need for async&#x2F;await language level keywords is disappointing</i><p>This is unfortunate [1], I agree. The challenge is that if you don&#x27;t do that, it&#x27;s <i>very</i> hard to compile the resulting code to efficient JavaScript. Dart was initially only a web language and is now both a web and a mobile language.<p>You can think of function calls as having two different calling conventions: return the value normally, or return it by invoking a continuation with the result. Asynchronous functions require the latter. You could compile <i>all</i> function calls to that style, but it&#x27;s much slower and generates larger JS.<p>You could try to infer which functions should be called using an async style and which shouldn&#x27;t. That works in simple cases, but breaks down in complex cases involving generics and higher-order functions. I don&#x27;t know of any literature that investigates how feasible this is in practice, so making your language <i>rely</i> on this optimization for tolerable performance is a very large gamble.<p>This may change over time now that JS has generators and may be adding async&#x2F;await syntax, but Dart was designed before either of those existed.<p><i>&gt; Also if&#x2F;else not being an expression</i><p>Yeah, everything being an expression is nice. I wish Dart had been designed that way. The original designers of the language believed they needed to be <i>very</i> conservative in order to be successful and I think they overshot that mark.<p><i>&gt; syntactic complexity (e.g. defining constructors with factory&#x2F;static&#x2F;const keyword combinations)</i><p>Some of this is annoying, yes. It does have some practical value, though:<p>* The restriction around initializing final fields in the constructor initialization list, which is what forces you to use factory constructors in some cases, ensures a very nice property: it means in Dart you can <i>never</i> observe a final field before it has been initialized. This is not true in C#, Java, or Kotlin. Now that we are working on non-nullable types for Dart [2], this will let us have sound non-nullable types, unlike those other languages.<p>* Personally, I find const to be more of a hassle than it&#x27;s worth, but const constructors do let you define real compile-time constant objects of user-defined classes, which isn&#x27;t something some other languages can express. That, in turn, lets you rely on very fast identity tests for checking equality between two objects. Flutter relies on this heavily when diffing the widget tree to determine which parts have changed efficiently.<p><i>&gt; Why come up with a new language in 2011 that repeats the null mistake?</i><p>Tell me about it [3].

Electron is effectively (nipped) as it is most usually just the shortest path to giving apps a persistent offline option outside of the browser sandbox.

2189,"My experience (as a senior native Android dev) has been definitely bad so far. Configuration errors and inexplicable error messages popping up on a regular basis. 
The amount of troubleshooting it constantly required - instead of focusing on the task at hand - started to feel cumbersome after a week or two. Simplest functionality such as breakpoints would randomly stop working. All these problems aren&#x27;t exclusive to me, I would pretty much always succeed in googling them up, usually along with dozens of solutions suggested by the community (each of them different).<p>The documentation and tutorials leave a lot to be desired, too. A lot of this stuff is outdated, and the official documents are imprecise and feel like a draft (even when compared to what the much less mature Flutter brings to the table in this regard).<p>Tooling is far behind what you get if you go native. Eg. support for refactoring, whatever editor you use, will be more than rudimentary and virtually nonexistent in comparison to what Android Studio offers. The same goes for unit testing &#x2F; integration testing support, it&#x27;s rather iffy.<p>One of the more important UI Android features - Material transitions - is pretty much impossible to recreate in React Native.<p>I also don&#x27;t find JavaScript - even with TypeScript on - nearly as good a language as Kotlin.<p>This isn&#x27;t meant to be a rant: just an honest summary of my few weeks of experience fiddling with RN. You mention your native development was done in Swift; I heard that React Native is allegedly much more reliable for iOS than Android development. I can&#x27;t really verify it either way, but potentially this might be why our mileages vary.<p>The upsides? React Native pretty much abstracts away the lifecycle concerns, which are still a pain in the neck for a native Android dev. Hot reloading. No obsolete APIs maintained for backwards compatibility; understandably. Asynchronous programming is simple enough (although with Kotlin&#x27;s coroutines arguably on their way to become the go-to solution on Android, it&#x27;s not necessarily a win over native). Nothing else has impressed very much me so far. I used Xamarin for a commercial project once, and it felt considerably better, even though it was three years ago.",2019-02-14 16:56:17,19163395

2191,"In practical terms, flutter due to approaching transonic conditions is probably pretty rare. That kind of flutter is (mostly or most often) due to the interaction of normal shocks with the control surfaces, or coupling with an elastic mode of the wing or tail surface.<p>The flutter in the first video is occurring at very much subsonic speeds, and looks to be either the result of flying a purposely underdesigned tail surface, or flying a properly built one beyond its rated flight envelope. The second video contains a wide variety of flutter instances, some of them aeroelastic, some of them transonic, and so on.<p><i>One</i> way to get into a transonic flutter, however, is to be a hotshot business jet pilot who flies higher and higher and faster and faster. The higher you go, the lower the density, so your minimum speed increases. Also, the temperature goes down, so the speed of sound decreases. Where these two meet is called &quot;coffin corner,&quot; and you don&#x27;t always have to fly yourself into it by increasing your speed and altitude; you can fly close to coffin corner, and then fly <i>into</i> colder air or less dense air. No matter how you get there, you&#x27;re stuck. Slow down, and the wings stall, the nose drops, you pick up speed, and hit transonic flutter. Speed up to stay in the air, by dropping the nose, and you hit transonic flutter directly.",2019-02-19 23:17:41,19203960

I backed it off only because I get nervous with any unexpected turbulence which is not uncommon in Florida.<p>The Piper Saratoga I flew for a bit didn&#x27;t seem to like the speed as much, that or the toga was a bit more vocal than the Cirrus in what it was feeling with regards to airspeed.",2019-02-19 23:57:03,19204275
2193,"Only in the most general terms, and from first principles: Composite structures will have a higher stiffness per unit mass, which will cause the fundamental frequencies to be higher both for the pure structural modes and the control surface interaction modes. It&#x27;s therefore likely that you&#x27;d only begin to encounter these aeroelastic modes at higher speeds. In other words, if you take the driving frequency as something like the inverse of the time it takes for air to pass over the wing, that may match the metal wing more closely than the composite wing. Modeling that stuff in a wind tunnel is very tricky, and you used to end up with these not-at-all-realistic-looking models that, nonetheless, captured some aspect of the full-scale aircraft being modeled.<p>Don&#x27;t die.

Also my pricing strategy and how to monetize become more and more clear. However, I am still a bit scared by some open questions:<p>1) How mature is flutter in its handling of in-app payments? My scenario is simple: User can make a one-time approach and then use the complete features of the app. Is it mature enough to handle the above scenario in flutter only (= no plattform-specific hackery)?<p>2) Is it possible to have local-only data storage despite having in-app purchases? One selling point of my app is that data is only stored locally, so I would love to extend that claim even to user identities. Also - to be honest - local is simpler than distributed.<p>3) Should I decide to put up a database with user id&#x27;s and their purchase status somewhere - what would be a good approach? I am looking for low price, low mantainence and I don&#x27;t care about configurationability, since my use case will be fairly common.
